Dancing With the Stars will return for its 22nd season with Len Goodman back where he belongs, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champ, and a baby boy or girl for Allison Holker. There's much to look forward to, but not before we close out this season one last time with everything that happened after the finale! (In case you missed it, you can read our recap of the best and worst moments here .) Almost an hour after Tom Bergeron declared Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough the winners of season 21, Bindi was still in disbelief, shouting from the top of her lungs, ""I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!"" Her exuberance and genuine nature endeared her to literally every one on set, but no one more so than Derek. ""It's just so special with Bindi,"" he told reporters backstage. ""She's a champion of life."" Bindi shared the same sentiment, telling those in the ballroom that she gained another brother in Derek. In case you needed further proof that the two are friends for life, consider this: Derek's hopping on a plane to Australia in a couple weeks ""to tackle crocodiles and get my official khakis!"" The Houghster may have nabbed his sixth Mirrorball trophy, but it was his partnership with Bindi that undoubtedly made it his favorite season. ""There's not a thing I would change about this season,"" he told Glamour post-show. ""There's not a week I would change, a dance I would change, and that was a very calming, very peaceful feeling. The show is a completely different show than the first time I won, and to win at this level and the standard that this show has been raised to, it's been incredible."" While Bindi and Derek make the press rounds in New York City, it's no secret that she's itching to get back to her hometown down under. ""I can't wait to get back to all the animals, continue all the conservation work, and carry on in my dad's footsteps."" Season 21 runner-ups Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter were understandably disappointed not to win the big prize, but they both praised Bindi and Derek for their phenomenal journey this season. ""Bindi was the whole package,"" praised the red-haired stunner. ""She and Derek had a beautiful partnership."" Still, ""it's bittersweet in may ways. Did I really want this to be my first Mirrorball? Absolutely. I would be lying if I said I didn't. But Bindi was undeniable this entire season. She grew so much, and she's just such a beautiful person you can't help but be captivated by her. Both [she and Nick] are winners, and I truly believe that."" Echoed Nick: ""It was just such a pleasure to be here. I didn't expect to get anything, so anytime something great happened in the competition, it was a pleasant surprise to me."" So what's up next for Nick? Well, aside from getting ready for Baby Boy Carter , his solo album ( All American ) drops today, and he has a movie coming out next year that he wrote and directed. As for third-place contestant, Alek Skarlatos , he'll be heading on the DWTS Tour this winter, but his immediate plans are much simpler: ""I can't wait to get on the plane tonight to eat. A lot."" But what about his dating life? Any updates on that? ""It's been pretty crazy, honestly. [I haven't had time] for many dates lately."" Added Lindsay: ""I'll be his wing woman on tour!"" During all the hectic action backstage, Allison Holker was a ball of energy, especially for someone six month's pregnant. ""I feel incredible!"" gushed the pro. ""Dancing around with a baby that's the size of a football in your belly is never an easy task, but it's been amazing. Although I never expected to see myself in a sparkly costume on the Dancing With the Stars stage six months pregnant!"" Allison (and husband tWitch) will find out the baby's gender on December 10, ""which is our anniversary too."" In case you're wondering, she'll reveal whether it's a boy or a girl on social media shortly thereafter! In the meantime, Allison's prepping for her first Thanksgiving in charge of the turkey as long as the nerves don't get the best of her. ""I heard you have to brine it, but I don't even know what that means!"" she laughed. ""I'm watching The Chew to learn techniques!"" One of the biggest stories backstage was the announcement that Len Goodman would be returning to the judges' table next season, and the news was heralded with much excitement from the pros. ""I can't wait,"" admitted Mark Ballas . ""I love Len. We missed him this season. It was definitely different, [so it will be] good to have him back in the driver's seat."" Allison Holker felt the same way: ""I think Len Goodman was the heart and soul of Dancing With the Stars and was such a great leader at the judges' table, along with Bruno, Carrie Ann, and Julianne."" Casting is currently underway for season 22. If Mark Ballas gets his wish, he'd love to have girlfriend BC Jean compete as a contestant. ""She would be great, but you know [the producers] would probably mess with us and give her to Derek!"" Mark joked. So what was B.C.'s take on this idea? ""Yeah, and we'd probably win,"" she laughed of the possibility of being paired with Mark's best friend and honorary brother. Speaking of Derek, Mark told us backstage that getting to perform with BC (who he called ""the love of my life"") while Derek and Bindi danced was his favorite part of the evening. ""It was just amazing, cool, and unique. I've been on this show nearly 10 years in a row, and I've never experienced something like that.

And no one’s been on the receiving end of that criticism more than Taylor Swift. Despite a lengthy catalogue of hits in which she plays scorned exes and lovelorn balladeers, the country singer turned pop superstar has been seen less as a victim than as a purveyor of victimhood, using her prodigious songwriting talents and natural affability to become a megaphone for perceived injustice. So what does Taylor Swift do to prove to us she’s aware of this narrative (the one, of course, from which she’d like to be excluded)? Acid gossip that borrows from better songs – Taylor Swift: Look What You Made Me Do review Read more Release a music video – for her new single, Look What You Made Me Do – that’s practically boiling over with meta-commentary and self-referential detail, from an ongoing visual snake motif to a tombstone that literally reads “Taylor Swift’s reputation”. Yes, it’s painfully on-the-nose, but Swift’s brand hasn’t exactly been built on subtlety. Look What You Made Me Do – or LWYMMD, as its Twitter hashtag dictates – is well on its way to smashing streaming records, but the song hasn’t been as well received by critics. Continuing in the tradition of her last album, 1989, which marked Swift’s official evolution into pop music behemoth, it largely abandons that which made her a household name – singable melodies; sharp, specific lyricism; grand tales of romantic enchantment – in favor of radio-engineered pop and glib proclamations of vengeance. Near the end of the song, she answers a phone call; someone’s asking to speak with Taylor Swift. “She can’t come to the phone right now,” Swift 2.0 says. Why? “Because she’s dead.” In the battle between Swifts, my allegiance is with the deceased version, a shrewd chronicler of young-adult courtship and seasoned, starry-eyed songwriter. So much so that hearing her new single made me nostalgic for the days of Fearless and Red. But the Old Swift be damned; this new one is all about retribution and, as the title of her forthcoming album suggests, reputation. The music video for LWYMMD, which premiered during Sunday night’s VMAs, sees Swift double down on her vengeful streak, making theatre of her scandal-laden career in an attempt to communicate a self-awareness that’s mostly eluded her. The video is good fun, if a little bit mad; it’s certainly the most brazen and ambitious pop music video since Beyoncé dropped Lemonade in the spring of last year, replete with pyrotechnics and dozens of costume changes. But it doesn’t amount to much more than a succession of disconnected images. And if the images could talk, they might say, “I know what you think of me”, or, perhaps, in the words of Joanne the Scammer: “I’m a messy bitch who lives for drama.” But still, in all those images, Swift left a lot to be decoded. A connoisseur of the tongue-in-cheek (remember the capitalized letters in her lyric booklets that spelled out clues about a song’s subject?), it begins with a zombified T-Swift digging her own grave. Get it? The Old Swift is dead, dunzo, kaput, resigned to the graveyard of pop culture history. First, we see the aforementioned tombstone, where Swift’s reputation lies, but also a second one, reading “Nils Sjoberg”, the pseudonym Swift used as a co-writer on her ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris’s song, This Is What You Came For, a collaboration widely assumed to have contributed to their breakup. Swift’s writing credit was supposed to be kept secret, but when her team revealed that she had, in fact, written the Harris-Rihanna hit, her ex went on a tweetstorm about how Swift was looking for “someone new to try and bury”. So she buried the fictitious Mr Sjoberg. In the next shot, Swift luxuriates in a tub of diamonds, where there sits a single dollar bill, a possible reference to the symbolic dollar she earned in last month’s sexual assault case against the radio DJ who groped her in 2013. Internet conspiracists, too, ran with this as a visual reference to Melania Trump, who could be seen forking diamond necklaces like spaghetti in a Vanity Fair spread last year. But those were the same people insistent that Swift, who kept mum during last year’s presidential campaigns, is a closeted Trump supporter. That the election coincided with Swift’s period of self-imposed exile did little to get her back in the public’s good graces; but diamonds, unlike gilded toilet seats, do not a Trump reference make. This next one is a dead giveaway: Swift sits atop a throne as dozens of snakes slither at her feet. One even serves her what we can only assume is piping hot tea, the kind Kim Kardashian dished out when she released audio of Swift, who publicly disputed Kanye West’s lyric about her in Famous, appearing to sign off on those same lyrics in a phone conversation with West. Afterwards, Swift’s reputation as a snake in sheep’s clothing took off; Kardashian helped further that image by tweeting a bunch of snake emojis on international snake day. More than a year later, it seems Swift’s ready to embrace the title: ahead of the single’s release, she dropped cryptic reptilian teaser videos. And now, the snake has shed her skin. There’s also an inscription on Swift’s gold throne that reads “Et Tu Brute”, the Latin phrase used in William Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar when Caesar is being assassinated by his friend Brutus. It’s a far cry from the Swift of yesteryear, whose Shakespeare references were more Romeo and Juliet than Julius Caesar. But she’s dead, remember? It was at the 2016 Grammys, when 1989 beat Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly for album of the year, that Swift first began to truly test the public’s patience.

First, we see the aforementioned tombstone, where Swift’s reputation lies, but also a second one, reading “Nils Sjoberg”, the pseudonym Swift used as a co-writer on her ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris’s song, This Is What You Came For, a collaboration widely assumed to have contributed to their breakup. Swift’s writing credit was supposed to be kept secret, but when her team revealed that she had, in fact, written the Harris-Rihanna hit, her ex went on a tweetstorm about how Swift was looking for “someone new to try and bury”. So she buried the fictitious Mr Sjoberg. In the next shot, Swift luxuriates in a tub of diamonds, where there sits a single dollar bill, a possible reference to the symbolic dollar she earned in last month’s sexual assault case against the radio DJ who groped her in 2013. Internet conspiracists, too, ran with this as a visual reference to Melania Trump, who could be seen forking diamond necklaces like spaghetti in a Vanity Fair spread last year. But those were the same people insistent that Swift, who kept mum during last year’s presidential campaigns, is a closeted Trump supporter. That the election coincided with Swift’s period of self-imposed exile did little to get her back in the public’s good graces; but diamonds, unlike gilded toilet seats, do not a Trump reference make. This next one is a dead giveaway: Swift sits atop a throne as dozens of snakes slither at her feet. One even serves her what we can only assume is piping hot tea, the kind Kim Kardashian dished out when she released audio of Swift, who publicly disputed Kanye West’s lyric about her in Famous, appearing to sign off on those same lyrics in a phone conversation with West. Afterwards, Swift’s reputation as a snake in sheep’s clothing took off; Kardashian helped further that image by tweeting a bunch of snake emojis on international snake day. More than a year later, it seems Swift’s ready to embrace the title: ahead of the single’s release, she dropped cryptic reptilian teaser videos. And now, the snake has shed her skin. There’s also an inscription on Swift’s gold throne that reads “Et Tu Brute”, the Latin phrase used in William Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar when Caesar is being assassinated by his friend Brutus. It’s a far cry from the Swift of yesteryear, whose Shakespeare references were more Romeo and Juliet than Julius Caesar. But she’s dead, remember? It was at the 2016 Grammys, when 1989 beat Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly for album of the year, that Swift first began to truly test the public’s patience. That was also where she publicly rebuked West’s"
gossipcop-2761931201,1,"Lou Rocco/Getty Images  How Michael Strahan’s net worth was built  Michael Strahan has grown his wealth through 14 years of playing pro football and his second career as a talk-show host.  The son of an Army major, Strahan grew up in Germany and did not play competitive high school football until his senior year when his parents sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in Texas.  The former defensive end played well enough to earn a scholarship to Texas Southern University. By his senior year of college, he had set a record for sacks, which got the attention of the NFL.  In 1993, the New York Giants drafted Strahan as the 40th overall draft pick. Over the next 14 seasons, he became the league’s all-time quarterback sack leader, played in the Pro Bowl and helped the Giants defeat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII.  Upon retiring in 2008, Strahan concentrated on his off-field talents. In 2012, he became Kelly Ripa’s “Live! With Kelly” co-host, replacing longtime host Regis Philbin. Four years later, he left the show and joined ABC’s “Good Morning America”; it took more than a year for “Live” to announce Ryan Seacrest as its new co-host.  Strahan also serves as a Fox NFL Sunday analyst during the football season.  As of May 2017, Strahan’s net worth was $65 million, with a salary of $17 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.  You can use this net worth calculator to see your net worth.  Michael Strahan  Born: 1971  Birthplace: Houston  What he’s up to now  Strahan hung up his jersey in 2008, but he did not retire quietly. As of April 2016, he is a full-time co-host on ABC’s morning show “Good Morning America.”  Months later, the network hired him to host his own game show, “$100,000 Pyramid,” a reboot of an old classic. The fashionable football star also launched his own clothing line in 2015 in JC Penney stores.  Along with Curt Menefee, Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long and Jimmy Johnson, Strahan appears on “Fox NFL Sunday” each week during the NFL season.  Accolades  Throughout both his college and pro football careers, Strahan had a reputation for sacking quarterbacks, and in 2001, he set the record for most sacks in an NFL season. He also appeared in the Pro Bowl seven times.  In 2008, after his final season in the NFL, he helped lead the New York Giants to a Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots.  As a morning show host, Strahan has earned two Daytime Emmy Awards for “Outstanding Talk Show Host” for his work on “Live! With Kelly and Michael.”","You are a journalist.

Here's a news piece based on the sentence:

Former NFL defensive end Michael Strahan has amassed an impressive fortune through a successful career on the gridiron and his subsequent ventures in the media industry. According to estimates, Strahan's net worth currently stands at a staggering $65 million.

Strahan's 14-year career in the NFL, during which he won a Super Bowl with the New York Giants, undoubtedly served as the foundation for his financial success. However, it was his transition to a talk-show host that truly catapulted his wealth.

In 2012, Strahan joined the cast of ABC's ""Live with Kelly and Michael,"" alongside Kelly Ripa, and quickly became a fan favorite. His charismatic personality and engaging interview style helped to boost the show's ratings and increase its advertising revenue.

Moreover, Strahan has also made savvy investments in various business ventures, including a fitness app and a men's grooming line. These ventures have not only diversified his income streams but have also contributed to his overall net worth.

Strahan's financial success is a testament to his hard work and dedication to his craft. As he continues to excel in the media industry, his net worth is likely to continue growing in the years to come."

(This is always an exciting moment in a ceremony.) It was an extraordinary mix of tradition and modernity, of centuries of history and up-to-the moment flourishes. Oprah was here, and so was Meghan’s mother, an African-American social worker who wore a conventional mother-of-the-bride outfit and also a nose stud. It somehow looked charming and just right. The entire royal family was here, along with a complement of English aristocrats and important personages. The music was stately and beautiful. The setting was awe-inspiring. There was a flotilla of clergymen, an extraordinary mélange including the archbishop of Canterbury and — in a striking inclusion in this most ancient of places — the head of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Curry. Chosen to give the address to the congregations, Bishop Curry, who is African-American, quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His voice rising and falling with emotion, he made a big, generous, impassioned case for love as the most important thing there is, in religion and in life. His address came after a reading by Lady Jane Fellowes, Harry’s aunt (her sister was Diana, Princess of Wales) that was both full of joy and a signal, it seemed, that the sadness in Harry’s life since his mother’s death had finally lifted. It was a passage from the Song of Solomon: “Arise my love, my fair one, and come away; for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The dress was a success: sculptural simplicity. Photo Our fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, is also watching, and she has a quick take for us on Meghan Markle’s dress. It was absolutely simple: pure and sculptural, in double bonded silk cady with a wide boatneck, long sleeves and sweeping train. It was Meghan Markle’s wedding dress. It was by Clare Waight Keller, a British woman and the first female designer of Givenchy. And it was everything people had hoped. This was not a Cinderella choice, not one that spoke of fantasy or old-fashioned fairy tales. Instead, it placed the woman proudly front and center and underscored Ms. Markle’s own independence. At the same time, it celebrated female strength, promoted a local designer and reached a hand across to Europe (where Ms. Waight Keller has a day job). The five-meter veil was of silk tulle, with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads and organza, and contained embroidery representing the flora of all 53 Commonwealth nations. Video And it was entirely a surprise. In all the rumors that had swirled around The Dress, from Ralph & Russo to Stella McCartney, Ms. Waight Keller’s name had never come up. In the end, Ms. Markle outthought us all. As this starts, long may it continue. And the After-Party Dress The newly minted Duke and Duchess of Sussex departed Windsor for their evening reception at Frogmore House in a very James Bond fashion. The duchess wore a second dress by designer Stella McCartney. You can read our fashion critic Vanessa Friedman’s reaction here.

It’s a great royal-and-celebrity cocktail party! (Sadly without cocktails.) Kate and William’s wedding was solemn, stately, stuffy, full of dignitaries, politicians, and the sort of boring personages known here as the great and the good. But this looked totally fun for the guests — even more fun than, say, the Academy Awards — because no one was competing for anything and no one was forced to talk about their outfits to television reporters. Part of the change in tone is down to the passage of time and to how much Britain, or perhaps the royal family, has changed in the last few years. Another reason, of course, is that Harry, being the second son and not a future king, has the freedom to be more relaxed, less constrained by tradition, and less conventional than his brother. This wedding has nothing to do with dynasty, or ensuring the security of the royal line. (We hope they have kids! But only because it’s fun to have kids, not because it would be some sort of international crisis if they did not.) This wedding had everything to do with two people who are totally into each other and wanted to have a great big happy celebration. Oprah, Beckhams and Clooneys, oh my! Photo One of the great excitements about any wedding, of course, is the moment you learn who has been invited and who has not. Meghan and Harry’s list was kept secret, until the very moment that dozens of mysterious figures started to enter St. George’s Chapel. It was very exciting. There was none other than Oprah Winfrey, in a snug pink dress, a pair of very cool sunglasses and a massive broad-brimmed hat spectacularly festooned with flowers.

gossipcop-955735,0,"Tom Cruise truly is as great as he seems. The cast of Mission: Impossible-Fallout learned firsthand just how impressive the star was throughout the course of their filming. From stopping mid-take to ask extras if they were okay, to expertly maneuvering a helicopter in the mountains, Cruise won over the hearts of the star studded group, including Henry Cavill. “I am not easily impressed, and I know some people who have done genuinely seriously impressive stuff, and watching Tom do these stunts, especially in the mountains in that helicopter. I just thought, ‘Okay I am officially impressed,'” the Superman actor shared. He added, “This is ridiculous what he is doing. And he learns all these skills for these movies and does them to an elite level. It is remarkable, truly remarkable.” Aside from being an amazing stuntman, the actors added that he is genuinely a good person, with Angela Bassett saying, “He truly is just incredibly warm, generous, embracing. As soon as he turns to see you he breaks out into this great smile and just welcomes you with a warm smile.” For Rebecca Ferguson, she said the actor has the ability to make you feel like “you are the center of the room.”Simon Pegg on the other hand, just feels uncomfortable. “He compliments you a lot and he looks at you and it gets uncomfortable because you get so much Cruise love on you. People are always so all over on him, so I think he likes to redistribute it,” the Brit joked. The general consensus though is that the Top Gun star is a just a normal guy, despite all the mystery that surrounds him. “He allows himself to be surrounded by a lot of mystique and conjecture and gossip and he just sort of lets it fester and I think that makes people think he is some sort of inhuman kind of thing, but he is just a bloke,” Pegg explained.

More recently, he has joined Jimmy Fallon for a hilarious round of Mad Lib Theatre, before crossing the country to join James Corden as he skydived for the first time. Even as he excels as Ethan Hunt, it’s been hard for the actor to duplicate that magic in other would-be franchises.The last couple of years have not been kind to Tom Cruise’s status as an action hero. In 2016, he played the taciturn Jack Reacher again in Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, following that in 2017 as the lead of The Mummy and American Made. All three of those movies stumbled in one way or another — American Made acquitted itself best of all and received strong reviews, but it was not exactly a runaway hit. Meanwhile, The Mummy doomed a shared universe before it began and Jack Reacher earned $56 million less globally than its predecessor. That impact? No joke. #MissionImpossible A post shared by Tom Cruise (@tomcruise) on Jun 18, 2018 at 12:09pm PDT As Cruise is only four years away from 60 — yes, really — it’s not wrong to wonder if his action-star days are far behind him. But Mission: Impossible – Fallout suggests he’s got some life in him yet.Throughout the last two decades, Cruise has excelled when he plays IMF agent Ethan Hunt. Hunt was first introduced in the 1996 movie adaptation of the 1960s TV show, Mission: Impossible, pulling off a daring and breathtaking break-in of CIA headquarters, fending off an attack by a man in a helicopter while hanging for his life on the top of a fast-moving train and more. As Cruise has grown older, he’s worked more often in action films than dramas — in between the first and second M:I films, Cruise co-starred in Magnolia and Eyes Wide Shut, a one-two punch he’s not replicated since — but he’s never better than when playing the beleaguered IMF agent. Fallout could easily have felt like more of the same, were it not for, among other things, Cruise’s fierce commitment to doing whatever he has to do to entertain people. Here, that means “nearly killing himself.” Not every one of this film’s 147 minutes is dedicated to action sequences that seem to catalogue the ways in which Tom Cruise could have died on set — the pre-title sequence is both ominous and deliciously twisty without featuring any severe action. But once Ethan and his not-entirely-willing new partner, CIA agent August Walker (a mustachioed Henry Cavill), have to do a HALO jump from above 20,000 feet in the air into a Parisian nightclub, Fallout isn’t playing around. Yes, Cruise pulled off that jump, just like he climbed up a rope to take over a helicopter mid-flight and jumped from one London building to another. (Of course, as you may know, he broke his ankle in the process, in a shot that’s in the finished film.) It’s difficult to know exactly what makes the Mission: Impossible franchise so special for Cruise, what makes it work so well for his intense persona. Movies like Jack Reacher: Never Go Back and The Mummy suggest that Cruise is looking for other franchises on which to work in between making M:I adventures. (Seeing that Cruise is co-starring in a Top Gun sequel next only furthers this notion.) But few of those capture the ineffable essence of Cruise the way that Ethan Hunt does. In Fallout, Hunt is at his most desperate. One of Ethan’s refrains in Fallout feels like a Cruise mission statement: “I’ll figure it out!” The tension in that statement is always in wondering how. Ethan, of course, does figure things out at the last second, but how he does is always thrilling. The same can’t be said for those other would-be franchises. (Hard to believe that we’re only a year removed from Universal announcing that so-called Dark Universe with The Mummy, which was","You are a journalist.

From stopping mid-take to ask extras if they were okay, to expertly maneuvering a helicopter in the mountains, Cruise won over the hearts of the star studded group, including Henry Cavill. “I am not easily impressed, and I know some people who have done genuinely seriously impressive stuff, and watching Tom do these stunts, especially in the mountains in that helicopter. I just thought, ‘Okay I am officially impressed,'” the Superman actor shared. He added, “This is ridiculous what he is doing. And he learns all these skills for these movies and does them to an elite level. It is remarkable, truly remarkable.” Aside from being an amazing stuntman, the actors added that he is genuinely a good person, with Angela Bassett saying, “He truly is just incredibly warm, generous, embracing. As soon as he turns to see you he breaks out into this great smile and just welcomes you with a warm smile.” For Rebecca Ferguson, she said the actor has the ability to make you feel like “you are the center of the room.”Simon Pegg on the other hand, just feels uncomfortable. “He compliments you a lot and he looks at you and it gets uncomfortable because you get so much Cruise love on you. People are always so all over on him, so I think he likes to redistribute it,” the Brit joked. The general consensus though is that the Top Gun star is a just a normal guy, despite all the mystery that surrounds him. “He allows himself to be surrounded by a lot of mystique and conjecture and gossip and he just sort of lets it fester and I think that makes people think he is some sort of inhuman kind of thing, but he is just a bloke,” Pegg explained. Fans of the 56-year-old are delighted https://www.instagram.com/p/BiC6IVODUeD/?taken-by=tomcruiseby his return to the public eye as he travels the world to promote the most recent installment of the franchise. More recently, he has joined Jimmy Fallon for a hilarious round of Mad Lib Theatre, before crossing the country to join James Corden as he skydived for the first time. Even as he excels as Ethan Hunt, it’s been hard for the actor to duplicate that magic in other would-be franchises.The last couple of years have not been kind to Tom Cruise’s status as an action hero. In 2016, he played the taciturn Jack Reacher again in Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, following that in 2017 as the lead of The Mummy and American Made. All three of those movies stumbled in one way or another — American Made acquitted itself best of all and received strong reviews, but it was not exactly a runaway hit. Meanwhile, The Mummy doomed a shared universe before it began and Jack Reacher earned $56 million less globally than its predecessor. That impact? No joke. #MissionImpossible A post shared by Tom Cruise (@tomcruise) on Jun 18, 2018 at 12:09pm PDT As Cruise is only four years away from 60 — yes, really — it’s not wrong to wonder if his action-star days are far behind him. But Mission: Impossible – Fallout suggests he’s got some life in him yet.Throughout the last two decades, Cruise has excelled when he plays IMF agent Ethan Hunt. Hunt was first introduced in the 1996 movie adaptation of the 1960s TV show, Mission: Impossible, pulling off a daring and breathtaking break-in of CIA headquarters, fending off an attack by a man in a helicopter while hanging for his life on the top of a fast-moving train and more. As Cruise has grown older, he’s worked more often in action films than dramas — in between the first and second M:I films, Cruise co-starred in Magnolia and Eyes Wide Shut, a one-two punch he’s not replicated since — but he’s never better than when playing the beleaguered IMF agent. Fallout could easily have felt like more of the same, were it not for, among other things, Cruise’s fierce commitment to doing whatever he has to do to entertain people. Here, that means “nearly killing himself.” Not every one of this film’s 147 minutes is dedicated to action sequences that seem to catalogue the ways in which Tom Cruise could have died on set — the pre-title sequence is both ominous and deliciously twisty without featuring any severe action. But once Ethan and his not-entirely-willing new partner, CIA agent August Walker (a mustachioed Henry Cavill), have to do a HALO jump from above 20,000 feet in the air into a Parisian nightclub, Fallout isn’t playing around. Yes, Cruise pulled off that jump, just like he climbed up a rope to take over a helicopter mid-flight and jumped from one London building to another. (Of course, as you may know, he broke his ankle in the process, in a shot that’s in the finished film.) It’s difficult to know exactly what makes the Mission: Impossible franchise so special for Cruise, what makes it work so well for his intense persona. Movies like Jack Reacher: Never Go Back and The Mummy suggest that Cruise is looking for other franchises on which to work in between making M:I adventures. (Seeing that Cruise is co-starring in a Top Gun sequel next only furthers this notion.) But few of those capture the ineffable essence of Cruise the way that Ethan Hunt does. In Fallout, Hunt is at his most desperate. One of Ethan’s refrains in Fallout feels like a Cruise mission statement: “I’ll figure it out!” The tension in that statement is always in wondering how. Ethan, of course, does figure things out at the last second, but how he does is always thrilling. The same can’t be said for those other would-be franchises. (Hard to believe that we’re only a year removed from Universal announcing that so-called Dark Universe with The Mummy, which was"
gossipcop-470066082,1,"Demi Lovato has sparked rumors of a new romance with Lauren Abedini, a Los Angeles-based DJ who goes by the stage name Kittens. According to Page Six, Lovato was spotted holding hands with Abedini in Disneyland over the weekend, causing fans and media outlets to speculate whether they could be dating. This is only the latest speculation surrounding Lovato’s love life, as the pop singer has never officially confirmed her sexuality– despite alluding to her being bisexual in her song lyrics. Here’s what you need to know about Demi Lovato’s sexuality: 1. Fans Have Supported the Rumors Involving Lauren Abedini good morning to demi lovato and her possible girlfriend and no one else pic.twitter.com/ZrDKzhVBBD — kenny (@broadwaysdarlin) September 11, 2017 While there’s yet to be any confirmation from Lovato or Abedini’s representatives as to whether they’re dating, fans on social media have been eager to voice their support. “Demi Lovato spotted with her rumored new girlfriend Lauren Abedini; a DJ, Producer, charity runner, and feminist!” wrote the Lovato fan account Demipedia. Another humorously tweeted”The good news is that Demi Lovato has a girlfriend. The bad news is that it isn’t me.” Demi Lovato spotted with her rumored new girlfriend Lauren Abedini; a DJ, Producer, charity runner, and feminist! pic.twitter.com/0DEPobohgt — demipedia (@ddlovatopedia) September 11, 2017 Others snapped photos of Lovato and Abedini during their Disneyland trip, with one user posting a comparison of the singer with her ex Wilmer Valderrama and Abedini and joking that she’s made “a big upgrade.” Check out this post and the rest of Twitter’s reactions below. miss demi lovato had the biggest upgrade i've ever seen pic.twitter.com/brbZs8igJW — lindsey (@cryingwithmila) September 11, 2017 The thought of Demi Lovato having a girlfriend is possible the greatest thing to enter my head — keels (@keeley_cjd) September 11, 2017 The good news is that Demi Lovato has a girlfriend. The bad news is that it isn't me. — ste(screeching into the wilderness)ph (@stphfrndz) September 11, 2017 2. She’s Had Relationships With Several Male Celebrities Lovato, like most notable celebrities, have dated other people in the industry. According to Pop Sugar, she dated The Cab frontman Alex DeLeon from 2008-09, and later based the breakup song “Catch Me” on him. Lovato also had brief flings with Trace Cyrus (Miley’s older brother) in 2009 and Joe Jonas, her self-proclaimed “BFF,” in 2010. Her most notable relationship to date, however, has been with Valderrama, whom she dated from from 2010 to 2016. In an interview with Latina magazine, Lovato discussed what attracted her to the That 70’s Show actor: When I dated white guys, it wasn’t as passionate as my relationship with Wilmer. Maybe that’s just Wilmer. But I do believe that Latin people are just more expressive, more passionate with their emotions. He’s very manly, and he can be stubborn like Latino men can, but he’s protective and he cares so much and loves so hard. I’ve been blessed enough to have him in my life, and not just as my man, but also my best friend. Since her breakup from Valderrama, Lovato’s been seen with MMA fighter Guilherme “Bomba” Vasconcelos and Abedini. 3. Ruby Rose Claims that She & Lovato ‘Hooked Up’ in 2013 In 2013, model and actress Ruby Rose turned heads when she tweeted that she had a lesbian tryst with Lovato. “I’m like the one person demi has slept with that didn’t sell on naked photos of her so eff off,” Rose tweeted out. She went on to say “Think ill take a few days off social media whilst @ddlovato’s friends attack me for being a ‘scorned ex-lover’ get over it! I liked the hair.” Furthermore, a source for Life & Style said that Rose and Lovato dated for two years while the singer took a break from her relationship with Valderrama. A post shared by Ruby Rose (@rubyrose) on Aug 13, 2017 at 1:32pm PDT Lovato addressed these claims in a 2015 interview with Complex magazine. “Rumours are rumours, and people are going to spread them,” she said. “You can believe what you want, but no, I was not in a relationship with her. By the way, love is fluid.” The singer added “Whether there’s been rumours with one specific person or not, that’s all that matters. Humans are humans, and when you connect with somebody on a spiritual level it doesn’t matter. I don’t want people to ever look at the past or rumours or anything and try to figure me out.” 4. She Won the GLAAD Vanguard Award for Promoting LGBTQ Equality While Lovato may be keeping her personal life under wraps, she has made no effort to hide her support for the LGBTQ community. The singer has been so supportive, in fact, that she was given the GLAAD Vanguard Award in 2016, which, according to the GLAAD website, is “presented to media professionals who have made a significant difference in promoting equality and acceptance.” The award was given to her by close friend and former Camp Rock co-star Nick Jonas. “Demi Lovato has consistently used her platform as a successful artist to send messages of acceptance and support to LGBT people everywhere,” said GLAAD President & CEO Sarah Kate Ellis. “She is an extraordinary ally who is committed to helping young people embrace who they are and live the lives they love.” During her acceptance speech, Lovato said “You should always love yourself for who you are,” she said. “The skin that you are in, whether you identify with it and are afraid to tell people, just go for it. You can do it!” Watch the full speech above. 5. She Said She’s Not ‘Denying’ or ‘Confirming’ Her Sexuality Lovato’s 2015 single “Cool for the Summer” had many fans wondering whether or not this was her coy way of speaking on her sexuality. The lyrics “Tell me what you want, what you like, it’s ok / I’m a little curious, too” and “Got a taste for the cherry / I just need","You are a journalist.

gossipcop-5319163677,1,"Come December, it's become near tradition over the past few years for everyone to complain about how the previous 12 months have been the worst ever. This year, however really, really feels like it. This year has been a barrage of bizarre and bummer headlines that at times it's felt like some dystopian nightmare.  It's been so bad that the Kardashian-West clan have just decided to end 2016 early. Yes, Kim and Kanye have decided to cancel all public and professional commitments for the end of the year and plan to maintain their social media blackouts as well. To be exact, a flack told Page Six that Kim and Kanye “plan on taking the rest of 2016 off and spending time as a family.""  Which, frankly, we wish we all could do, don't we?  Is it possible for President Obama's last major act to be an executive decree for us to just all get a chance to chill out and recuperate for the remaining 26 days left in this bummer of a year? Sure, there's no political safeguarding against any potential additional music legends from dying or preventing any further tragedies and disasters from happening or ensuring that some new odd Zika-like disease pops up, but there's got to be something? How about the ""Netflix and Chill Act?"" Just an order that all Americans get to spend the next month relaxing and catching up on any television series they may have missed this year.  Of course, when it comes to Kim and Kanye it's understandable that they've decided to literally cancel the rest of their 2016. Kim was still in the midst of recuperating from being robbed at gunpoint in Paris when her husband Kanye was hospitalized following a very public breakdown.  They've had to endure these private tragedies while also dealing with immense public interest and rumors running rampant in the tabloid press.  E!, the home of the Kardashian's reality TV empire, reports that a family source says ""Kim is doing okay despite reports.""  ""She has many things on her plate so being overwhelmed is expected,"" the source continued. ""She wants to get Kanye back on his feet. She is not leaving him. She loves him.""  Kanye was released from an L.A.-area hospital last week after spending more than a week receiving treatment for exhaustion. Kim West was reportedly by his side throughout the entire ordeal and now wants to make sure Kanye continues to receive therapy and treatment now that he's out of the hospital.  Despite your personal opinion on the pair, it certainly does seem like the family deserves the rest. In addition to their dual ordeal, they also have two young children to care for after all (in fact, today is Saint West's first birthday). Maybe it's best we all let them lay low and chill for the next month or so.  Unfortunately, we all don't have the luxury as much as we wish we could. Then again, it's not looking like 2017 is shaping up to be any better. Hopefully, a rested and healthier Kim and Kanye can get back into form and provide us with the not-quite-as-tragic-as-this distractions we'll probably desperately need in the new year.  Update: Kanye, for one, has now reappeared in public, albeit in a very low-key way. He was spotted with newly blond hair at designer Rick Owens' furniture show in Los Angeles .","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news.

As the holiday season approaches, people across the globe are bracing themselves for the annual onslaught of complaints about the state of the world.

According to experts, this trend is not just limited to social media, where people often take to platforms like Twitter and Facebook to air their grievances. Instead, it has become a widespread phenomenon, with people from all walks of life expressing their dissatisfaction with the past year.

""It's become a kind of ritual, where people feel the need to proclaim that the previous year was the worst ever, as if it's some kind of badge of honor,"" said Dr. Jane Smith, a psychologist at XYZ University. ""It's a way of processing and making sense of the challenges and hardships that we've faced over the past year.""

Despite the prevalence of this trend, there are also many people who are actively working to change the narrative and focus on the positive aspects of the past year. ""We don't want to get caught up in the negativity and doom and gloom,"" said John Doe, a community organizer in New York City. ""We want to focus on the progress we've made and the good things that have happened, so that we can build on those successes and create a better future for everyone.""

As the world prepares to ring in the new year, it remains to be seen whether this trend of complaining about the previous year will continue, or if people will begin to shift their focus towards a more positive and hopeful outlook for the future."

gossipcop-1156920900,1,"The wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was held on 19 May 2018 in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in the United Kingdom. The groom, Prince Harry, is a member of the British royal family; the bride, Meghan Markle, is an American and former actress.[note 1] On the morning of the wedding, Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, conferred upon him the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. On her marriage, Markle became Duchess of Sussex.[1] The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, officiated at the wedding using the standard Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony published in Common Worship, the liturgical text of the Church of England.[2][3] Announcement of engagement [ edit ] Prince Harry is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. He and Meghan Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the Canadian-American legal-drama television series Suits, have been in a relationship since 2016, having first met in July 2016.[4] The relationship was officially acknowledged on 8 November 2016, when a statement was released from the royal family's communications secretary addressing the ""wave of abuse and harassment"" directed toward Markle.[5] Harry and Meghan attending church on Christmas Day, 2017 On 27 November 2017, Clarence House announced that Prince Harry would marry Markle in the spring of 2018.[6] They were engaged earlier the same month in London, with the Prince giving Markle a bespoke engagement ring made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, consisting of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection.[7] At the same time, it was announced that they would live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace following their marriage.[8] The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh expressed their delight at the news, while congratulations came in from various political leaders, including the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[8] During the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace's Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[9][10] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[7][11] Markle is the second American[note 2] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[12] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[13][14][15][16][17] Under the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign's consent in order to marry. Harry was fifth in line at the time of his engagement.[18] The Queen's consent was declared to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 14 March 2018.[19][20] Although Markle attended a private Catholic school in her early years, she is not Roman Catholic.[21] On 6 March 2018, she was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at St. James's Palace.[22] Although Markle was divorced, the Anglican Church has permitted marriage to divorced persons with a living spouse since 2002.[23][24] After the engagement, Markle began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[25] She will retain her U.S. citizenship during the process,[26] but Kensington Palace have indicated that the decision on whether she will retain dual nationality has not yet been made.[25] Retaining U.S. citizenship is expected to create tax complications.[27] The couple was invited to celebrate Christmas 2017 with the royal family at the Queen's Sandringham estate.[28] The official engagement photographs were taken by Alexi Lubomirski (a former assistant to Mario Testino) at Frogmore House, and were issued by Kensington Palace on 21 December 2017.[29] To mark the wedding of Harry and Meghan, the Royal Mint produced an official UK £5 coin, showing the couple in profile.[30] In May, a set of commemorative postage stamps, featuring the couple's official engagement photographs, was issued by Royal Mail.[31] Wedding [ edit ] Planning [ edit ] Preparation for wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Unlike the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the wedding day of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was not declared a bank holiday.[32] The wedding was on the same date as the FA Cup Final, which Prince Harry's brother William normally attends in his role as President of the Football Association.[33] Holding the royal wedding on a weekend is a break with the royal tradition of having weddings on a weekday.[34] On 12 February 2018, Kensington Palace announced that the ceremony would commence at 12:00 Midday BST. Venue [ edit ] The wedding took place on Saturday, 19 May 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor.[35] The chapel had previously been the venue for the weddings of Prince Harry's uncle, the Earl of Wessex, as well as that of his cousin, Peter Phillips, and for the blessing of the marriage of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, Harry's stepmother.[36] Cost [ edit ] The royal family announced that they would pay for the wedding.[37] The costs for the cake, the florist, and the catering have been estimated to be £50,000, £110,000, and £286,000 respectively,[38] and the overall cost is expected to be around £32 million.[39] The security costs are expected to be lower than those of the 2011 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.[40] The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead has reportedly spent £2.6 million on cleaning the town and roads.[40] It has been predicted that the wedding will trigger a tourism boom and boost the economy by up to £500 million.[41] Wedding attire [ edit ] The wedding invitations specified a dress code for men of ""Dress Uniform, Morning Coat","You are a journalist.

Friends: The duo re-enacted a downplayed version of the kiss when they won the MTV Movie Award for best kiss in 2000  During the ceremony Sarah thanked Selma for her 'most rewarding kiss on-screen ever.'

gossipcop-6803836615,1,"What do Katy Perry, Meryl Streep, Anderson Cooper and Chelsea Clinton have in common? They have all eaten human flesh at LA’s notorious cannibal restaurant, Cannibal Club.  The private restaurant has long operated under the radar in Los Angeles, with rumors circulating about who has attended and what is really served behind closed doors. Now a leaked Cannibal Club document has exposed some of the notorious restaurant’s “elite” patrons.  CANNIBALISM ‘MORE POPULAR THAN YOU MIGHT THINK’  Meryl Streep, Chelsea Clinton and CNN’s Anderson Cooper all hold Cannibal Club membership, according to the document. Katy Perry, who has previously said that “Cannibalism is way more popular than you might think” and “human flesh is the best meat“, is also a regular diner.  Boasting that the restaurant is the “cutting edge of experimental cuisine” and serves “L.A.’s cultural elite“, the Cannibal Club website makes clear they “specialize in the preparation of human meat” that comes from “young and healthy bodies.“  Cannibal Club’s visiting chefs “hail from around the world” and come to L.A. to “practice their craft free of compromise and unbounded by convention,” according to the Cannibal Club website.  ‘FILMMAKERS, INTELLECTUALS, AND CELEBRITIES’  “Our exclusive clientele includes noted filmmakers, intellectuals, and celebrities who have embraced the Enlightenment ideals of free expression and rationalism. On event nights, avant-garde performance artists, celebrated literary figures, and ground-breaking musicians entertain our guests.  “At Cannibal Club, we celebrate artistic excellence as the natural and inevitable expression of the unbridled human spirit.“  Describing each dish as a “study in taste and elegance“, Chef de Cuisine Sophie Laffite explains: “The meat we serve is selected from the young and healthy. Consistent with the practice of cannibalism in many primitive societies, we view anthropophagy as homage to the dead, who are reborn into the bodies of their consumers.”  But don’t think you can just walk in there and check the place out. The private restaurant operates a strict vetting policy, according to the website:  “It is necessary for us to operate privately and to vette our members in order to avoid disruption from the less enlightened.“  HUMAN MEAT MENU  The current menu listed on the site includes Sirloin Steak (human meat, flame-broiled 8oz), Liver and Mushroom Pirozhi (“a Russian version of pierogies, baked rather than boiled, with a savory filling of wild mushrooms and human liver“) and Placenta Lasagne (“an otherwise traditional lasagna with one layer of cheese substituted by minced placenta in heirloom tomato sauce, seasoned with garlic, onion and oregano”.)  Elspeth Blake, the Cannibal Club proprietor who claims to have earned her stripes working under Vincent Sardi Jr. in New York, did not immediately respond to our questions regarding where the human flesh comes from.  ‘YOUNG AND HEALTHY BODIES’  In the FAQ section of the website, Cannibal Club claims:  “Most of the businesses and institutions who supply us prefer to keep those relationships discreet. On the individual level, bodies are often bequeathed to us. For some, this is a way to supplement life insurance and offset funerary expenses. For others, such as Cannibal Club member Gwendoline Fenwich, who was served to her friends and relatives at the Club in January of 2008, being prepared as a meal, and thereby reborn into the bodies of the living, is an attractive alternative to the more the traditional practices of burial and cremation.“  The revelation that Hollywood royalty, pop stars and cable TV anchors consume human flesh when they are in Los Angeles is merely the latest example of public figures being exposed as dark figures, reveling in the darkness. Jay-Z described Jesus Christ as “the original fake news“ late in 2017. Miley Cyrus said “Hail Satan” on live radio and claimed she has a closer relationship with the devil than with her “earthly father”, Billy R","You are a journalist.

gossipcop-8055383376,1,"Yes, the headline sounds extremely insane, but then again this is Teresa Giudice we’re talking about here!  According to a new report, the Real Housewives of New Jersey star is planning to cash in on her husband Joe Giudice’s deportation proceedings.  If you recall, it was reported weeks ago that a judge had ruled that Joe should be deported upon his release from prison, where he is currently serving a 41-month-prison sentence for bank and wire fraud. Well now, sources are telling Radar Online that Bravo has offered Teresa $500,000 to film a special about his deportation.  “Teresa was offered big bucks to film a special about Joe’s deportation and she agreed to do it,” an insider revealed. “Half a million dollars to share the story on camera.”  And this story is believable because this isn’t Teresa’s first rodeo when it comes to cashing in on her crimes legal drama!  “It is going to be like the other specials when she was in prison and will show how she and Joe and the girls are handling the scary prospect of Joe getting deported,” added the source.  IS TERESA BEGGING PRESIDENT TRUMP TO STOP JOE’S DEPORTATION?  Earlier this year, an Immigration official confirmed that “records show that an immigration judge ordered Mr. Giudice be removed from the United States on March 14, 2018.”  A source close to Teresa adds that she needs the Bravo money as Joe tries to appeal the deportation order.  “Teresa will do anything for the money. She never stops thinking about taking care of her girls and she agreed to this so that they would have money for college. She is a good mom and wants to provide for her children,” the source stated.  Joe will reportedly be turned over to ICE custody upon his March 2019 release, although it is likely he could be released earlier than March which would mean an earlier deportation back to Italy.  UPDATE – Teresa is denying this report. Her attorney, James Leonard, tells the Gossip Cop website that she has no current plans to do a spinoff show about Joe’s possible deportation.

According to a new report, the Real Housewives of New Jersey star is planning to cash in on her husband Joe Giudice’s deportation proceedings.","As a journalist, here is the news piece based on the given sentence:

In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that Teresa Giudice, star of the hit reality show Real Housewives of New Jersey, is planning to profit from her husband Joe Giudice's ongoing deportation proceedings. According to a new report, Giudice is considering writing a tell-all book about her family's experiences with immigration authorities, with a particular focus on her husband's battle to avoid being deported back to Italy.

The report, which cites sources close to the Giudice family, suggests that Teresa is looking to capitalize on the media attention surrounding her husband's legal woes in order to secure a lucrative book deal. The proposed book, which is rumored to be titled ""The Deportation Diaries,"" would allegedly delve into the emotional struggles that the Giudice family has faced in recent months, as well as the legal battles that Joe has faced in his fight to remain in the United States.

While it is not uncommon for celebrities to write books about their personal experiences, the decision to profit from her husband's deportation proceedings has raised eyebrows among some critics, who argue that it is in poor taste to capitalize on such a sensitive and serious issue. However, given Teresa's history of reality TV success and her ability to generate headlines, it is likely that the book will be a bestseller if it is indeed published.

The news comes just days after Joe Giudice's appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals was denied, leaving him just one last legal hope to avoid being deported. The couple's legal battles have been well-documented on the reality show, and it is likely that the book would provide a detailed look at the personal toll that the proceedings have taken on the Giudice family.

While it is unclear at this time whether the book will actually be written, the report has already sparked a heated debate online, with some critics accusing Teresa of exploiting her husband's situation for financial gain. However, given the couple's history of reality TV success and their ability to generate headlines, it is likely that the book would be a hit if it is indeed published."

The Oscar-winning actor, known for his captivating performances on the silver screen, has reportedly found himself in hot water with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). According to sources close to the matter, the actor has been ""dragged into an FBI probe"" after gifting stunned dinner party guests with a whopping [1 million dollar] in cash stuffed in a designer bag.

The incident allegedly took place during a private gathering at the actor's luxurious mansion, where he hosted a select group of friends and acquaintances for an intimate dinner party. Sources claim that the actor, known for his generosity, decided to give each of his guests a unique parting gift - a designer bag filled with [1 million dollar] in cash.

However, it seems that the FBI has taken notice of the actor's generosity, and has launched an investigation into the source of the funds. According to reports, the agency is looking into whether the actor's gift was an attempt to bribe or influence his guests in any way.

The actor's publicist has yet to comment on the matter, but sources close to the actor have confirmed that he is cooperating fully with the FBI's investigation. It remains to be seen how this scandal will affect the actor's career and reputation, but one thing is certain - this is not the kind of publicity he was hoping for.

In related news, the designer bag in question has reportedly been confiscated by the FBI as part of their investigation. Sources say that the bag, which is valued at over [100,000], is being examined for any evidence of illegal activity.

The actor's legal team has not yet commented on the matter, but sources close to the actor have expressed confidence that he will be cleared of any wrongdoing. For now, the public will have to wait and see how this scandal unfolds, and whether the actor's career will be forever tarnished by this high-profile investigation."

gossipcop-5210414258,1,"The things you plan the least sometimes turn out the best. This is why every right-thinking person hates St Valentine’s Day. Scheduling a day for romance is as joyful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon.  We’re in Stanley’s on St Andrew’s Street in Dublin, downstairs in the wine bar. It’s an unplanned outing after an impromptu cry of “Let’s go out, but not to our usual place”. I’ve eaten here before, and enjoyed it except for some oversalted fish. This is a second chance. They don’t come easily.  But two things happened after the previous review. First, a man who was at the next table wrote to me to say how much he loved Stanley’s. He had no vested interest, but was talking as a well-dined eater about town. Later, I found out that chef and co-owner Stephen McArdle had something more important on his hands than my dinner that night. His son had been born hours before.  If that doesn’t earn a second chance, nothing will. So we’re tucked in at a small table under the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted a soft green. There’s a candle in a wax-crusted wine bottle on the table and high-class jazz standards on the sound system.  For the moment, it feels like we’re not in Dublin. We could be in a city anywhere and lucky enough to find a place we’ll remember fondly when we get home.  The menu is chalked up on the wall and Liam has already ordered some cod croquettes, balls of soft fluffy fish in crispy lagging jackets sitting in a small puddle of silken house mayonnaise.  The star of Stanley’s is Morgan Vanderkamer. She’s the sommelier here. But don’t let that put you off. Bad sommeliers are pretentious up-sellers, there to push diners towards the wallet-busting bruisers on the wine list. Vanderkamer has taken the nonsense out of the role and will open your mind to new ideas about what to drink with your food. If you thought sherry was for fogeys and posers, she will change your mind. So we have ice-cold glasses of manzanilla to cut through the fluffy cod croquettes. We are in excellent hands.  The main event is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. We’re going with an oloroso, the ruby-coloured sherry that gets its colour and kick from time and ageing. There are two on the menu, Vanderkamer says. One is good; the other is “amazing”, and priced accordingly, she warns. With a €16 plate of food between us, we push the sherry cask out and live it large on the oloroso at €13 a glass. It is a good decision.  There’s a small farmyard on that €16 charcuterie plate: generous slices of duck ham, smoked cured slices of moist pink meat. The duck ham is the soulmate of the apricot puree dotted on one side of the plate. The sharp pickled gherkins sing with the “bacon and cabbage”, a slice of ham hock terrine wrapped in crinkly soft leaves of bright-green savoy cabbage. There are two small delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, delicate to the point of dissolving on contact with the tongue. The pear and vanilla sauce, in a small ramekin, takes the sweetness of the liver to another even more decadent place.  Just in case there isn’t enough on the plate (there is), we’ve ordered a plate of the bean and chorizo stew. The beans are in fact chick peas – but that’s even better in my book – and the chorizo has been minced to a small rubble that sits on top of the soupy mix. It’s the kind of stew where the juices have transformed from separate elements of meat, tomato, oil and wine into one glistening sheen. We get a blended Priorat, a Spanish red as heartwarming as the stew, to sip with it.  Dessert would be an option only for people less greedy in their savoury ordering. There’s a final glass of Rasteau, a fortified Grenache that’s served deliciously chilly.

Headline: Study Finds that Spontaneous Plans Often Lead to Greater Satisfaction on Valentine's Day

Subheading: Research Suggests that Overplanning Can Ruin the Magic of the Holiday

In a surprising finding, a new study has revealed that the things we plan the least often turn out to be the most satisfying on Valentine's Day. The study, conducted by the University of Love and Relationships, surveyed over 1,000 couples and found that those who embraced spontaneity on Valentine's Day reported higher levels of happiness and satisfaction than those who meticulously planned their celebrations.

According to the study's lead author, Dr. Rachel Smith, ""Our findings suggest that the pressure to plan the perfect Valentine's Day can actually detract from the joy and intimacy of the holiday. When we let go of our expectations and embrace the unknown, we are more likely to experience the magic of the day.""

The study also found that couples who embraced spontaneity were more likely to engage in novel and creative activities, such as surprise picnics or impromptu dance dates, which can lead to increased feelings of excitement and connection.

The findings have important implications for those looking to make the most of their Valentine's Day celebrations. ""Rather than stressing over the perfect gift or date, couples should focus on cultivating a sense of spontaneity and adventure,"" says Dr. Smith. ""This can involve anything from a last-minute weekend getaway to a surprise dinner at a new restaurant.""

In light of these findings, it's no wonder that many right-thinking people have come to view Valentine's Day as a holiday that is best avoided. As one participant in the study put it, ""I'd rather eat a box of chocolates than suffer through another over-the-top, overly planned Valentine's Day.""

In conclusion, the study suggests that embracing spontaneity and letting go of our expectations may be the key to a truly fulfilling Valentine's Day. So, this year, why not try doing things a little differently? You might just find that the things you plan the least turn out to be the best."

Amidst rumors that the actress is marrying a British businessman, she’s put permanent roots down in California by purchasing the massive Cecil B. DeMille estate — check out pics of the lavish mansion here.  Angelina Jolie, 41, has a new home in Los Angeles…and it’s stunning. It’s been rumored for weeks that the 41-year-old had plans to purchase Cecil B. DeMille’s historic mansion, and now, she’s bit the bullet, putting down a $25 million offer, according to TMZ. The amount was reportedly accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow.  Cecil’s home, which he lived in until his death in 1959, is considered one of the greatest properties in L.A., and Angie will have some famous neighbors, including Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman and Ellen Pompeo. There’s tons of space for the six kids, too — the house boasts 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, plus a spacious backyard.  This huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53. The possibility of that big move happening seemed even more likely after reports surfaced on April 12 that Angie had met and fallen in love with a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.  The actress is reportedly already serious with this mystery man, and a family friend told InTouch that she’s even planning on marrying him! However, we also know that Brad and Angie’s divorce has been much more amicable recently, and she’s been letting him spend more and more time with the kids. Perhaps staying in Los Angeles is her way of making sure Pax, Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox continue to have a relationship with their father? Either way, the house is insane — check it out in the gallery above.  HollywoodLifers, what do you think of Angelina’s new house? Do you think she’s prepping for a wedding?","You are a journalist.

Jeff instructed each tribe to choose a leader: Malolo selected Brendan, while Chris volunteered for Naviti. Jeff also told the castaways they would only start with a machete, pot, a fishing kit, and a smaller supply of rice. Reward Challenge: A designated runner will have to race through a series of obstacles to dig up three sets of keys. Then, a designated puzzle solver will use the keys to unlock a slide puzzle. The first person to finish their puzzle wins a massive shelter building kit reward for their tribe. Additionally, the losing tribe will be forced to forfeit their fishing kit. However, if the tribe leader decides to forfeit the challenge during the puzzle solving portion, their tribe will get to keep the fishing kit, but the opposing tribe will get 20 eggs and flint in addition to the shelter building kit. For Malolo and Naviti, respectively, Michael and Sebastian were selected to run the course, while Laurel and Desiree were selected for the puzzle. Chris pulled the lever on Desiree, preserving Naviti’s fishing kit, but giving the larger reward to Malolo. As the Malolo tribe set up their shelter and got to know each other, Jacob openly stated his intention to search for a hidden immunity idol, causing his tribemates to distrust him. He also poured some of the tribe’s rice in his dirty sock to see if a clue was hidden in the jar, though there was not. Meanwhile at the Naviti camp, a power struggle started between Chris and Domenick, who questioned Chris’s decision to forfeit the opening challenge. Immunity Challenge: Each tribe will have to race across a net bridge to where two bags are hanging. Working together, they will then need to untie the bags to obtain a pair of ropes. Using the ropes, the tribe will need to slide a sled full of big puzzle pieces through a course. At the end of the course, they will need to solve a cube puzzle to win immunity. Naviti won the challenge, and also received a flint reward, as Malolo already had flint after winning the first reward challenge. For winning the immunity challenge, Naviti had to send one person from Malolo to Ghost Island, where they would be immune from the vote; Naviti sent Jacob after he declared Malolo was the best tribe in Survivor history. On Ghost Island, Jacob had to break an urn to play a game for an advantage; if he lost, he would have to forfeit his vote at the next Tribal Council. He subsequently won a game of chance which gave him Sierra’s legacy advantage from Game Changers. He had to will it to someone from Naviti, and he chose Morgan. He also made a fake idol. At Malolo, the tribe had to come up with a new plan, as Jacob was their intended target. Gonzalez rallied votes against Donathan for being the tribe’s weakest link, but at Tribal Council, her paranoia got the better of her as she whispered to her tribemates, asking who they were targeting that night. Although everyone told her they were targeting Donathan, it was revealed that they had lied to her, and Gonzalez was unanimously blindsided, becoming the first person voted out. At Naviti, Domenick searched for a hidden immunity idol in the middle of the night, which he eventually found; it was revealed to be Andrea’s idol from Caramoan. The next morning, he attempted to bury the hatchet with Chris, but the tension still lingered between the two. Domenick told Chris he found an idol moments after telling him the opposite, which caused Chris to distrust him. At Malolo, Jacob kept the legacy advantage information to himself and told his tribemates he found an idol on Ghost Island, but that he had left the paper behind, making Brendan suspicious. Reward/Immunity Challenge: Two pairs from each tribe will race through a series of obstacles in the water. They will then have to dive to release two sets of buoys. Another member will need to gather all of the marked buoys to the finish, where the last four members will need to get all eight in a basket to win immunity and a comfort reward of chairs, pillows, blankets, and a washboard. Naviti easily won after James could not even dive a foot in the water. Donathan panicked before eventually diving down and releasing the buoys for Malolo. Naviti sent Donathan to Ghost Island, and the urn he smashed was a dud. At Malolo, Stephanie considered working with Jacob to blindside Michael, but Jacob spilled the beans about the legacy advantage to Stephanie.

It makes me feel awful.”  This Morning/ITV  Kimberly said that Keaton expressed that he didn’t want to return even to the middle school even “when the whole world wanted to come and eat lunch with him.”  “I’ve struggled anyway especially being this close to Christmas break, but after seeing how big it got, I mean it just seems like maybe we should let it die down a little bit before we made any decisions so that we could kind of have a reality of what life is gonna be like,” she continued.  Love What Matters/Facebook  Keaton, of Knoxville, captivated the Internet earlier this month after a video uploaded by his mother showed the boy in tears as he lamented the bullying he’s endured at school. In the video, Keaton revealed that the bullies, “make fun of my nose. They call me ugly. They say I have no friends.”  However, Keaton’s emotional story took a turn when photos surfaced showing the family with Confederate flags. They faced more criticism when rumors circulated that the family used Keaton’s story for financial gain.  “I’ve said over and over, I’m an adult, I know who I am. I’m obviously sorry that it has offended so many people, but the backlash to my children…” Kimberly said during the morning show. “That’s something I wouldn’t wish on anybody.”  She added that the backlash has “brought the bullies out.” Kimberly also denied being racist in interviews with ABC and CBS News.  As the backlash seemingly began to subside, the family faced a new wave of criticism as photos from the Facebook page of Shawn White, Keaton’s allegedly estranged father, showed him sharing white supremacist propaganda. The pictures prompted Keaton’s older sister, Lakyn Jones, to defend her family in a tweet.  Henry Winkler Offers a Powerful Message Following Tennessee Student’s Viral Anti-Bullying Video  “You all can go look back at every tweet from every father’s & mother’s day to see that all we have is our mom,” Lakyn wrote on her Twitter account on Wednesday. “We have no contact with our dads. BECAUSE of their actions. That’s why all the articles say ‘estranged’ because we don’t talk to them. Leave us alone.”  Family friend Kaley Katz worked to shut down the criticism, telling PEOPLE that the accusations of racism are “rumors” and that it’s not true that Keaton is the target of bullying because he used a racial slur.  “The rumors are fake,” family friend Kaley Katz tells PEOPLE. “She is not a racist, Keaton did not bully anyone at his school, and she did not start the GoFundMe account in order for it to be a scam.”","You are a journalist.

I’m obviously sorry that it has offended so many people, but the backlash to my children…” Kimberly said during the morning show. “That’s something I wouldn’t wish on anybody.”  She added that the backlash has “brought the bullies out.” Kimberly also denied being racist in interviews with ABC and CBS News.  As the backlash seemingly began to subside, the family faced a new wave of criticism as photos from the Facebook page of Shawn White, Keaton’s allegedly estranged father, showed him sharing white supremacist propaganda. The pictures prompted Keaton’s older sister, Lakyn Jones, to defend her family in a tweet.  Henry Winkler Offers a Powerful Message Following Tennessee Student’s Viral Anti-Bullying Video  “You all can go look back at every tweet from every father’s & mother’s day to see that all we have is our mom,” Lakyn wrote on her Twitter account on Wednesday. “We have no contact with our dads. BECAUSE of their actions. That’s why all the articles say ‘estranged’ because we don’t talk to them. Leave us alone.”  Family friend Kaley Katz worked to shut down the criticism, telling PEOPLE that the accusations of racism are “rumors” and that it’s not true that Keaton is the target of bullying because he used a racial slur.  “The rumors are fake,” family friend Kaley Katz tells PEOPLE. “She is not a racist, Keaton did not bully anyone at his school, and she did not start the GoFundMe account in order for it to be a scam.”"

Beyond his impact as a multi-hyphenate force in our industry, Judd’s comedic chops, social consciousness, and lifelong love of film and television underlie his unique ability to entertain with heart – whether behind the scenes or in front of a live audience. And when it comes to expertise in live events, specials, and awards, nothing compares to the great Don Mischer. To our Guild’s fortune, Don has graciously agreed to add Awards Chair to his growing list of service and contributions to our Guild.”  Judd Apatow  Judd Apatow is considered one of the most sought-after comedy minds in the business. He has been closely associated with many of the biggest comedy films and hit television shows over the last decade and a half.  Apatow recently filmed his upcoming Netflix standup special, The Return, at the Just for Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal. The Return premiered on December 12 and marks Judd’s first solo standup special and literal return to his first love of performing standup which is how he began his career 25 years ago when he performed on HBO’s Young Comedians special in 1992.  Apatow made his documentary directorial debut with the 2016 Emmy Award-nominated ESPN Films 30 for 30 feature, Doc & Darryl, which chronicled the successes and scandals of New York Mets legends Dwight “Doc” Gooden and Darryl Strawberry. He followed that up with the forthcoming co-directed HBO documentary, May It Last, about folk rock icons the Avett Brothers premiering on HBO later this month.  Continuing down the documentarian path, Apatow is in post-production on a documentary on Garry Shandling who served as Judd’s mentor and father figure. The two-part documentary will air over two nights in late March on HBO.  Additionally, Apatow currently serves as co-executive producer of the television series Crashing, which returns to HBO for its second season in January 2018. He is also the co-executive producer of Netflix’s Love which returns for its third season in March 2018. Lastly, Apatow co-executive produced the multi-award-winning HBO series Girls which wrapped its final season earlier this year.  On the film side, Apatow recently produced the 2017 romantic comedy, The Big Sick, starring Kumail Nanjiani, Holly Hunter and Ray Romano. The dark horse box office success earned a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes which was the highest rated film of the summer.  Apatow has written and directed such films as The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, and Trainwreck.

gossipcop-8609335343,1,"Oh boy.  The first rule of going solo: Distance yourself as far as possible from the group and fan base that jump-started your career. Or so goes the advice Liam Payne is apparently following from Zayn: He’s the last to venture out on his own and the first to come out burning a bridge he still has to cross when it’s all said and done. On Liam’s first single, “Strip That Down,” he’s dissed One Direction plain as day. “You know I used to be in 1D, now I’m out free,” he sings. “People want me for one thing, that’s not me. I’m not changing the way that I used to be, I just want to have fun and get rowdy.”    But with nearly all remaining members of One Direction releasing new music of their own within weeks of each other, this song is not the only opportunity Payne has had to make his thoughts on his bandmates known. Speaking with Music Choice, he complimented Niall Horan’s new singles, but Harry Styles, not so much. “I’ll be honest with you, it’s not my sort of music. It’s not something I’d listen to,” he said. But he did have a quick save: “I think he did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. That’s the way I’d put it best, I think.” Liam also noted that Harry would probably say the same about his music since Harry doesn’t listen to hip-hop. “My song’s more ‘Rack City’ and his song is more of a different era to something I’d listen to, I guess,” he said. “Strip That Down” does feature a rapper, Migos’s Quavo, but a redux of the only song of note that Tyga has ever made it is not.","You are a journalist.

The first rule of going solo: Distance yourself as far as possible from the group and fan base that jump-started your career.

Veteran pop star, Taylor Swift, has revealed a shocking truth about her decision to go solo - she had to distance herself from her former group and fan base in order to find her own unique sound and style. In an exclusive interview with a prominent entertainment magazine, Swift confessed that the pressure to conform to her former group's image and sound was stifling her creativity and preventing her from reaching her full potential as an artist.

""I knew that if I wanted to be taken seriously as a solo artist, I needed to break free from the shadow of my former group and fan base,"" Swift explained. ""I had to create my own identity and sound, rather than relying on the success of my former bandmates.""

Swift's decision to go solo has proven to be a risky but ultimately rewarding one. Her latest album, ""Lover,"" has debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart and has received widespread critical acclaim for its introspective and emotionally charged lyrics, as well as its innovative blend of pop, rock, and electronic dance music.

Despite the challenges she faced in transitioning from a group to a solo artist, Swift remains optimistic about the future of her career. ""I'm so proud of the music I've made so far, and I'm excited to see where my solo journey takes me next,"" she said.

Swift's story serves as a powerful reminder that sometimes, taking a risk and breaking free from the comfort of familiarity can lead to the most rewarding and fulfilling outcomes. As she continues to soar as a solo artist, it's clear that Taylor Swift is a true force to be reckoned with in the music industry."

The Emmy-winning actress and Seagal costarred in the 1991 film Out for Justice.  A representative for Seagal did not respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment on Friday,  “When I was 23, a casting director, a woman, said, ‘Steven Seagal wants to go over the scene with you in his hotel room at 10 o’clock at night,'” Margulies told Jenny Hutt for SiriusXM’s Just Jenny on Friday.  “I lived in Brooklyn, and I said, ‘Oh, I don’t do that.

'What do you expect you know in the long run? But every time I see it, I go, ""You go girl!'"" Even though he previously had his reservations about his wife coming on the show, Harry now admits Lisa is doing a good job.

Breaking down, Lisa turned to Kim and said: 'I'm sorry if I've ever gotten into any of your business, I never meant to …' 'Well, you have,' Kim snapped, shocking everyone by cutting her short in her emotional moment and bringing up their feud on the jet over there. About to explode: Lisa became outraged after Kim brought up her husband Harry 'I have been sober for three years,' Kim insisted, adding that her one time taking a pill at the poker party was a one off.

She doesn't even know my husband.'

In a tense and dramatic episode of Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills, Lisa Rinna made her feelings quite clear when she zealously came to her husband Harry Hamlin's defense after Kim Richards accused him of harboring a secret.

During a heated argument at a dinner party, Richards claimed that Hamlin had been unfaithful to Rinna in the past, leading to a fierce and emotional response from Rinna. ""I'm not going to stand here and let you talk about my husband like that,"" she said, her voice trembling with anger. ""Harry is a good man, and he would never do something like that to me.""

Rinna's defense of her husband was met with skepticism from Richards, who insisted that she had evidence to support her claims. However, Rinna remained unwavering in her support for Hamlin, and the two women engaged in a tense and intense argument that left the other cast members in shock.

The accusations against Hamlin are just the latest development in the ongoing feud between Rinna and Richards, who have been at odds for months. However, Rinna's fierce defense of her husband has only served to fuel the fire, and it remains to be seen how this situation will play out in the future.

For now, it is clear that Rinna will not stand idly by while her husband is attacked, and she is prepared to fight for their relationship no matter what. The drama is sure to continue on Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills, and fans can expect even more fireworks as these two women continue to clash."
gossipcop-4796409702,1,"Kim Kardashian is allegedly “phasing out” mom Kris Jenner, particularly when it comes to her responsibilities as her longtime manager, amid reports Kim is ready for a total image overhaul after returning to the spotlight following her October robbery.  That’s according to a new report by Radar Online, who’s claiming that the mother-daughter duo could be caught in a nasty feud as a source alleged that Kardashian has had somewhat of an epiphany during her time away from the spotlight and allegedly has now opened her eyes to see how Jenner “used her” to build the Kardashian brand.  According to the site, Kim is ready to project a very different image from the uber-glamorous money flaunting Kardashian fans used to know and is allegedly ready to kick mom Kris to the curb, at least professionally, in order to do so.  A source alleged to the site this week that Kim now “seems to be thinking that Kris used her to get where she is today,” which Radar Online is alleging could have led to a nasty feud between Jenner and her daughter as well as the reality star reportedly making a pretty big business decision when it comes to her mom.  “[Kim] will never think of [Kris] in the same way again,” the source said of Jenner’s supposed drama with her daughter amid reports she believes Jenner has been “using” her for years.  The site then went on to report that Kim is now in the process of projecting her new toned-down image amid the feud claims with Kris, revealing that Jenner may no longer play such a big part in Kardashian’s career going forward.  “Kim hired a transition team to make sure that she gives off a different image than she did previously,” the source said of Jenner and her daughter potentially parting ways professionally, claiming that “part of this process includes phasing out [Kris’s] management.”  While Kris and Kim have not commented on the claims, this isn’t the first time it’s been reported that Kardashian may be looking to distance herself from Jenner, at least professionally, in the wake of her October robbery in Paris.  Radar Online claimed back in October that Kim Kardashian had grown wise to Kris Jenner’s “money making machine” after taking some downtime at the end of 2016, alleging at the time that Kim has been so busy with her career that she’s failed to realize how much Jenner, who is often referred to as her “momager,” had been controlling her life and career.  “Kim never realized how much [Kris] and the money-making machine was controlling her until this robbery,” an insider told the site of Kardashian’s feelings about Jenner at the time, months before it was reported that the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is allegedly looking to “phase out” Kris from her career.  “Kim is just starting to think that maybe Kris’s intentions were not pure all along,” continued the source in October, adding that Kim has been doing a lot of thinking about her father Robert Kardashian while taking some time away which has allegedly helped her to get wise to Kris’s seemingly relentless pursuit of fame for herself and her family.  “[Kim] told her family that she wanted to be the girl that her father wanted her to be and not the girl that she became with Kris’s help,” a source revealed last year, just months before it was reported that a feud could be brewing between Kardashian and Jenner.

Thank you!

No problem; here is the news piece based on the given sentence:

In a shocking turn of events, sources close to reality TV star Kim Kardashian have revealed that she is ""phasing out"" her longtime manager and mother, Kris Jenner. According to these sources, Kim is looking to distance herself from her mother's management style and take on more control over her own career, particularly in the wake of her recent return to the public eye following the October robbery in Paris.

This news comes as no surprise, given Kim's recent statements about wanting to revamp her image and focus on more meaningful projects. The sources also suggest that Kim is looking to bring in a new team to help her achieve these goals, and that she is no longer relying on her mother's expertise in the same way she has in the past.

While Kris has been instrumental in Kim's rise to fame, it seems that the young star is now looking to forge her own path and establish herself as a force to be reckoned with in the entertainment industry. Only time will tell if this move will be a successful one, but one thing is certain: Kim Kardashian is ready for a major image overhaul, and she's not afraid to take risks to get there."

Music’s odd couple, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton — aka the rocker and the country boy — have never been free of gossip speculating about their relationship. Apparently, the latest news is that the two are through. In Touch Weekly reports that Shelton actually unceremoniously dumped Stefani in February before embarking on a tour.  But wait — if that’s the case, then why is Stefani appearing with him on stage? And not just appearing … they’re appearing pretty cuddly. The singer posted an Instagram shot on Mar. 14 of the two embracing on what appears to be the most recent date of his “Country Music Freaks” trek.      This isn’t the first such picture she has shared since February. She posted several different angles of a jumbotron kiss on Feb. 25, and on March 11, one of herself hanging out with country up-and-comer Carly Pearce, who is an opener on Shelton’s tour, and another that shows off a backstage crowd (including Shelton and her younger brother Todd) in Greensboro, N.C.      Additionally, she sent good wishes to him on Mar. 1 — when Shelton was reportedly attempting to power through a Houston date while sick with the flu — and shared his latest video, “I Lived It” with a glowing string of hashtags.      So if the breakup is fake news, what spurred the rumors? According to In Touch‘s “insider” source, all of Stefani’s social media support is “a desperate attempt to ignore the truth,” and Shelton dumped her due to her “neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband, and her jealousy of him and other women.”  If this is to be believed, current Voice champion Chloe Kohanski was a factor in the breakup — Coach Shelton was apparently getting too close for Stefani’s comfort — as well as Shelton’s ex-wife Miranda Lambert, with whom the outlet claims he has rekindled a friendship and is “sharing intimate details” of his life.  Shelton isn’t reciprocating Stefani’s loving social media deluge — but then again, he’s never been one to do so. His social media accounts, once a source of ribald jokes, have developed gradually into a more businesslike platform to market his music and work on The Voice. He does, however, maintain a picture of Stefani as his profile photo.  Read more from Yahoo Entertainment:","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news.

gossipcop-1634815619,1,"California is “the darkest state in the Union,” according to country singer Dolly Parton, who claims that the state has been hit with a series of “Biblical disasters” in recent times as punishment for “embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Parton predicted Los Angeles will suffer a similar fate to Sodom and Gomorrah, the Biblical cities synonymous with vice, darkness and impenitent sin.  “California just keeps on being hit by disaster after disaster as foretold in the Bible,” the Grammy Award-winning entertainer and businesswoman told guests at Dolly Parton’s Stampede, a dinner and entertainment evening.  “Pestilence, and epidemics, and crime, and disease. And you know what? They don’t even realize what is happening to them. They are so corrupted, they can’t even see what is right in front of their eyes.”  “First they had the drought that lasted years and years, killing off billions and billions of dollars in crops, and making the soil so incredibly dry that a large rainstorm could easily turn into a major flood.  “Then they had the fires. Awful, awful fires. Historical, deadly fires. Thousands lost their homes, scores lost their lives and their livelihoods. Did you know the Thomas fire is still burning? In the winter!“  “And now they just had dozens of homes destroyed by mudslides,” Tennessee-born Parton said, making reference to the mudslides that have killed 15 people, with the toll expected to climb above 30. The mudslide hit an affluent part of California, and damaged Oprah Winfrey’s house.  “When they get hit with the ‘Big One‘, Parton said, referencing the popular name for the super quake expected to rock California in the future, “then we will know that the End Times have truly begun.”  “And don’t forget the sexual abuse scandals rocking Hollywood. They are being punished for embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Is California suffering from bad weather and bad luck, or is Parton right? Could a vengeful God be punishing California for decades of vice and sin?  Parton, who has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and been nominated for two Academy Awards, has previously stated that she considers herself an entertainer, and doesn’t believe it is her role to get involved with politics.  At last year’s Emmys, Parton was joined onstage by Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda to present an award. Tomlin and Fonda took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump, but Parton refused to join in, maintaining a dignified silence.","You are a journalist.

In a recent interview, country music legend Dolly Parton has made a shocking statement, claiming that California is ""the darkest state in the Union."" According to Parton, the state has been hit with a series of ""Biblical disasters"" in recent times as punishment for ""embracing Satan and rejecting God.""

Parton, who has been a vocal advocate for Christian values throughout her career, stated that the recent wildfires, droughts, and floods that have devastated California are not just natural disasters, but a sign of God's wrath. ""The Lord is not pleased with the actions of the people of California,"" she said. ""They have turned their backs on Him and embraced the devil instead.""

The singer's comments have sparked controversy and outrage among California residents, who have been struggling to recover from the recent disasters. Many have taken to social media to express their disappointment and anger, accusing Parton of exploiting the tragedies for her own religious agenda.

However, Parton remains unapologetic, insisting that she is simply speaking the truth as she sees it. ""I'm not here to judge,"" she said. ""But I do know that the Lord is a just God, and He will not be mocked. California needs to turn back to Him before it's too late.""

The statement has sparked a heated debate about the role of religion in public life, with some arguing that Parton's comments are inappropriate and disrespectful to the victims of the disasters. Others have defended her right to express her beliefs, even if they are unpopular or controversial.

Regardless of one's position on the matter, it is clear that the recent disasters in California have had a profound impact on the state and its residents. As the recovery efforts continue, it remains to be seen whether Parton's words will be seen as a call to action or a source of division and controversy."

Hollywood, CA - In a desperate bid to salvage their crumbling marriage, Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux reportedly embarked on a last-ditch effort to save their relationship during a recent vacation in Mexico with friends Jason Bateman and his wife. According to sources close to the couple, the two actors spent quality time together, engaging in activities such as boat rides, beach outings, and intimate dinners, in an attempt to rekindle their romance.

The troubled couple, who have been plagued by rumors of infidelity and relationship issues for months, were spotted looking happy and relaxed during their Mexican getaway. However, despite their efforts, it remains unclear whether their marriage can be saved.

Aniston and Theroux, who were once considered one of Hollywood's most powerful couples, have been struggling to keep their relationship afloat since the beginning of the year. The tension between them was palpable during several high-profile events, including the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild Awards, where they walked the red carpet separately.

The couple's relationship has been under intense scrutiny since their engagement in 2012, with constant rumors of marital problems and infidelity. Despite their efforts to keep their personal lives private, the media has continued to speculate about the state of their relationship.

While it is unclear whether Aniston and Theroux's marriage can be saved, their recent vacation in Mexico with close friends may be a sign that they are still trying to work things out. Only time will tell if their efforts will be successful."

It wasn’t until 1987 when the Pollen and Fox worked together in a movie called Bright Lights, Big City that a romance began to blossom. Pollan told Winfrey in 2002: ""From the beginning, I loved his sense of humour and that brain of his. He's so smart."" Fox told People in 1989 of hearing that Pollen and Bacon had split: ""It sounds really horrible, but it was one of those things. Someone goes, 'Did you hear that so-and-so aren't together anymore?' and you go, 'Hmm, that's too bad. Where's the phone?'"" Seven months after they started dating, he proposed on December 26, 1987. ""I wasn't really worried that she would say no,"" he recalled. ""The toughest part was trying to figure out when to get married, and then to figure out how nobody else could know about it."" The couple tied the knot in an outdoor ceremony at Vermont's West Mountain Inn on July 16, 1988. Fox, who is Episcopalian, and Pollan, who is Jewish, had an interfaith ceremony with both a minister and rabbi. ""Michael seemed a little nervous,"" Rev. Joan O'Gorman later told People. ""In fact, they seemed just like any other young and loving couple who were excited to be getting married."" Their first child, a son they named Sam Michael, was born on May 30, 1989. Fox and Pollan loved being parents, and would go on to have twin girls, Aquinnah Kathleen and Schuyler Frances, in 1995, and one more daughter, Esmé, in 2001. ""I kind of shut the door and said to everyone we love who wanted to see the baby, 'Just give us a little bit of time to get used to it ourselves,'"" Fox said after the birth of Sam. ""What's interesting is that the parental instinct just kicks in. The next thing you know, you've got a sore hip because you're holding him all the time."" The couple grew even closer when faced with one of life’s biggest challenges – Fox was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease at age 29 in 1991 (though it wasn’t until 1998 that he shared the news publicly). ""A lot of my adjustment has been dictated by Michael's point of view,"" Pollan said in a 2002 interview with Oprah Winfrey. ""He's so relaxed and so accepting of where he is, and that makes it easier for me, the kids, and everyone around him."" But when the couple first received the news, it completely shocked and devastated them. Fox fell into a depression and started drinking heavily, before eventually getting a handle on his new reality. ""I used to drink to party,"" the actor recalled on The Howard Stern Show in 2013, ""but...now I was drinking alone and to just not be [present]. Every day."" ""So once I did that,"" he continued, ""then there was about a year of, like, a knife fight in a closet, where I just didn't have my tools to deal with it. Then after that, I went into therapy and it all started to get really clear to me."" He said he realised he just had to take life ""one day at a time” and ""then everything started to really turn the other way. My marriage got great, and my career..."" Stern interjected here to suggest Fox's marriage ""got great"" after he realszed that Pollan wasn't going anywhere after his diagnosis. ""Exactly,"" Fox agreed. Fox later told Winfrey: ""There were a lot of questions I was afraid to ask Tracy. ""Like, 'Does it scare you that I'm sick? Do you not love me because I'm sick?' I didn't ask her those questions. But nothing Tracy was doing was showing me that she didn't want to be with me."" When Fox publicly revealed that he had Parkinson's disease in 1998, he began in earnest his life’s mission of raising awareness and money for Parkinson’s through the Michael J. Fox Foundation. As of April 2017 the foundation has funded more than $700 million in research. ""The reason I wasn't telling was that I wondered if people would still laugh if they knew I was sick,"" Fox told Winfrey. ""Can you laugh at a sick person [on TV] and not feel like an a--hole? I finally thought, let me not worry about that. What other people think is none of my business. I just have to have faith in the audience. If it's funny, they'll laugh."" And every day the couple deal with Fox's condition, but always as a team. ""Tracy wasn't sentimental or romantic about it at all,"" he told AARP magazine in 2017 about how his wife reacted to his Parkinson's diagnosis. ""No terror. No big windy... So, no exhibition of grief and fear. Tracy was just like, 'You've got a stone in your shoe. We'll do what we can until you can get it out. In the meantime, if you limp with the stone, that's all right. You can hold my hand, and we'll get over that.'"" Pollan added that, of course, there were tough days, but they both knew they were in this together. ""Through it all we've loved each other,"" Fox said. ""And that love never died,"" Pollan added. ""We had a solid foundation to begin with."" When Winfrey asked if Fox felt Parkinson's had been a blessing for their marriage, giving them no","You are a journalist.

gossipcop-7156734060,1,"The rumor mill is churning out some fake news about Barbados' own Rihanna.  In a video being circulated, which is entitled - Rihanna: ‘If Jesus Hasn’t Answered Your Prayers, Try Satan’, published December 2, 2017, on the World News Today YouTube Channel, a scripted voice says that Rihanna told the audience that growing up in Bridgetown was not easy and that you have to work twice as hard to make it. And the British anonymous voice went on to say that she said:  ""You have to hustle. I’m still hustling, but I am living proof that you can do anything... If you came here for tips I can give y’all the biggest one straight off...  ""If y'all have prayed to Jesus for years, prayed with all your hearts and got nothing back from him? ... Jesus doesn't care about you. Do you really even think he even listening? Hot tip y'all because you are my people, be efficient, go to satan.""  Then it went on to claim that the Prime Minister of Barbados the Rt. Hon. Freundel Stuart intervened hastily and shocked parents removed their children. On the night in question, the Prime Minister conferred the title of Cultural Ambassador on Robyn 'Rihanna' Fenty.  The only thing the video got right in that blurb was the name of Barbados' Prime Minister.  There was also an article on YourNewsWire.com with the same title and the same quotes written by Baxter Dmitry and posted December 1, 2017.  Loop News was there on site and recorded Rihanna's speech. Honoured, the young Grammy-award winner encouraged children and persons to believe in their dreams and have faith in God.  Rihanna told the crowd which included her friends and family, and numerous dignitaries, that she had no idea how she would get discovered on this little Rock but her dreams started on Westbury New Road, now named Rihanna Drive and she believed in her dreams, so ""believe in your dreams"", as cliche as it may sound.  Rihanna added:  ""I always knew it would happen, I always focused on the result, and that kind of faith, it really was just faith that childlike faith, that even now when I get a little bit discouraged or doubtful, it’s the thing that I go back to, having faith in God, like that even as a child.”  (Photo caption: Rihanna with her head bowed during the opening prayer at the renaming ceremony. (PHOTO: Richard Grimes))  On the fake YouTube video many people in the comments said that the video was a hoax and a lie. People called for the voice clip and video showing Rihanna making that fabricated speech and they asked why the video was missing from all other news agencies.  The ceremony was also broadcast live on TV in Barbados so tens of thousands of Bajans can refute the lies in the video and article aforementioned as well.

Rihanna has won numerous awards and accolades for her music, including multiple Grammy Awards, and has been named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world. Despite her success, Rihanna has faced criticism for her provocative lyrics and performances, as well as her controversial public persona.

The rumor mill is churning out some fake news about Barbados' own Rihanna. In a video being circulated, which is entitled - Rihanna: ‘If Jesus Hasn’t Answered Your Prayers, Try Satan’, published December 2, 2017, on the World News Today YouTube Channel, a scripted voice says that Rihanna told the audience that growing up in Bridgetown was not easy and that you have to work twice as hard to make it. The video, which has been viewed over 100,000 times, purports to show Rihanna delivering a speech at an unidentified event, in which she encourages her listeners to turn to Satan if they feel that Jesus has not answered their prayers.

However, there is no evidence to support the authenticity of the video, and it is believed to be a fake. A spokesperson for Rihanna has issued a statement denying that the video is genuine, and stating that the singer did not make any such comments. The statement reads, ""Rihanna did not make any such comments, and we are investigating the source of this fake video. We urge our fans to be cautious and not to spread false information.""

The fake video has caused a stir on social media, with many fans expressing outrage and disappointment at the idea that Rihanna would make such comments. Others have defended the singer, pointing out that the video is clearly scripted and that Rihanna is known for her philanthropic work and her commitment to her faith.

The American Mean Girls actress, 31, opted to wear a hijab for the event, conforming to the event's theme- which showcases the latest styles in hijabs, abayas and long hemlines. Letting a glimpse of her trademark flame hair shine through, the head piece perfectly framed her pretty face, accentuated by a touch of lipgloss and eyebrow pencil. She teamed it with a black bomber jacket and black trousers as she stopped to check out the cosmetics. The actress was seen posing with excited fans at the event, before making a quiet exit. Sharing a snap of the actress with their goodie bag, a beauty brand from the event later wrote: 'She was so lovely and was saying how she's into halal cosmetics and what she’s actually wearing on her face today was all halal!!'

There were previously rumors that Lohan might be converting back in 2015 when she was photographed holding a copy of the Quran while doing community service in Brooklyn. When appearing on the Turkish talk show Haber Turk later year, she explained that the book was actually just a gift from some friends. 'My very close friends, who have been there for me a lot, in London are Saudi and they gave me the Quran and I brought it to New York because I was learning,' said Lohan. Rare picture: In January Lindsay deleted all the pictures on her Instagram account and changed her bio, changing her bio to 'Alaikum salam.' (seen in her latest new Instagram post) 'It opened doors for me to experience spiritually, to find another true meaning. This is who I am.' She said however that she was attacked after that picture was released in the media. 'They crucified me for it in America. They made me seem like Satan. I was a bad person for holding that Quran,' said Lohan. She said that she was then happy to leave and return to London because she felt unsafe in [her] country. Lohan spent time in October of last year visiting child refugees who had fled Syria and crossed over into Turkey. She told Page Six last month that she was hoping to return to Turkey again either before of after the start of the new year. 'The dates are not set yet. It depends on how Turkey feels after the recent terrorist attack in Istanbul,' said Lohan, 'Not that any attack has or will ever stop me from helping those suffering, those who need our help the most.' She then added: 'I miss my family a lot, but they are very supportive and understanding of the fact that my main focus is business, writing and soon to start another film. More so, my work with refugees.' Just a few days before her account was wiped clean in January 2017, Lindsay had shared a poem in which she said she wanted to 'fix ISIS minds'. 'Sometimes I hear the voice of the one I loved the most. But in this world we live in on terror,' the poem went. 'Who i am to be the girl who is scared and hurt, when most things that happen i cannot explain. 'I try to understand, when i'm sitting in bed alone at 3am. So i can't sleep, i roll over. I can't think and my body becomes cold. I immediately feel older..... 'Than [sic] i realize, at least I am in a bed. I am still alive. So what can really be said? Just go to bed and close the blinds.

Demure: Lindsay Lohan certainly looked the part as she attended London Modest Fashion Week in the capital on Sunday, donning a floor-length gown that exuded elegance and poise. The former child star, who has long been known for her tumultuous personal life and legal troubles, seemed to have found a new sense of purpose in her faith and her fashion choices.

As she walked the red carpet, Lohan's demure demeanor and modest attire stood in stark contrast to her past provocative style and antics. The 34-year-old actress, who has been open about her struggles with addiction and her recent conversion to Islam, appeared to be radiant and at peace as she took in the sights and sounds of the fashion event.

Lohan's appearance at London Modest Fashion Week was a significant departure from her previous high-profile outings, where she was often seen flaunting her curves in skimpy outfits and posing seductively for the cameras. Instead, she opted for a more covered-up look, with a long-sleeved gown that fell to the floor and a headscarf that framed her face.

The actress's newfound modesty was met with approval from the event's attendees, who praised her for setting a positive example for young women and for showcasing the beauty of Islamic fashion. Lohan's participation in the event also served as a reminder that fashion can be both stylish and respectful, and that modesty does not have to be sacrificed for style."

She would come up to me at awards shows and say something and walk away, and I would think, 'Are we friends, or did she just give me the harshest insult of my life?'… She did something so horrible.

Despite their 25-year age difference — she's 61 and he's 36 — the #ProudMama is moving on.

In a shocking turn of events, Kris Jenner and her long-time boyfriend Corey Gamble have called it quits after three years of dating. The news comes as a surprise to fans, given the 25-year age difference between the two, but it seems that the #ProudMama is ready to move on.

A source close to the family confirmed the split, stating that the couple had been struggling to make their relationship work for some time. Despite their best efforts, it seems that the differences in their ages and lifestyles ultimately proved too much to overcome.

Jenner, 61, and Gamble, 36, first began dating in 2015 and quickly became a fixture on the red carpet. However, their relationship has always been met with scrutiny due to their age difference and the fact that Gamble is more than twice Jenner's age.

Despite the challenges they faced, the couple seemed to be going strong until recently. However, insiders say that the relationship had been on the rocks for several months before they finally decided to call it quits.

While the split is certainly a shock to fans, it's clear that Jenner is ready to move on and focus on her family and her own personal growth. With her signature confidence and determination, the #ProudMama is sure to bounce back from this setback and continue to thrive in the years to come."
gossipcop-2682199068,1,"Reverend Swadley – the local wedding priest and friend of the Pitt family – has confirmed to friends that the A-list couple recently spent a week with Brad’s family, discussing detailed plans for a wedding.  It’s believed the loved-up stars had flown to Missouri because Jen was desperate to reconnect with Brad’s mum, Jane, who she’d developed a very close bond with throughout the time of their first marriage.  During the seven-day visit, it’s been revealed that Jane orchestrated a meeting with the family priest Reverend Swadley – hoping it would be the gentle push Brad and Jen would need to make their reignited relationship official once again.  ‘Reverend Swadley met Jen recently at a family function that Brad’s mum, Jane, threw at their family home in Missouri,’ a close friend of the pastor’s told New Idea exclusively.  ‘Jen accompanied Brad home on the trip and attended church services with the family as well as joining Brad at meetings at the now-retired reverend’s home, who Brad reconnected with after he decided to find himself and renew his faith, following his split from Ange.  ‘He remarked at how at ease Jen was with his family, who clearly adore her, and how everyone said how much she’s been missed and how happy they all were to have her back in Brad’s – and their – lives.’  The source goes on to reveal that Reverend Swadley spoke at length with Brad and Jen about getting married as soon as possible, in Missouri, in a small ceremony, with just local friends and family present.  ‘Reverend Swadley revealed how in love Brad and Jen were and how they planned to officially wed as soon as their divorces were finalised, with him agreeing to conduct the ceremony and welcome them both back into the church,’ the friend of the pastor told New Idea.  Reverend Swadley revealed to our source that it was clear Jen loved seeing Brad’s family again, spending long days talking and laughing for the first time since their 2005 divorce.  ‘Jen spent five days reconnecting with Brad’s parents, brother and sister and many of his childhood friends who he remains close to,’ a friend of the pastor reveals.  Brad Pitt's parents are nothing but supportive Getty  ‘He said Jen kept saying how grateful she was that they’d been brought back together. And how they’ll both be baptised later this year before they officially wed – with Jen’s father, John, vowing to be at her side for the service and give her away again at their wedding, which will hopefully take place shortly after and be far more low-key than their original star-studded nuptials in Malibu.’  It’s the latest chapter in the pair’s rekindled romance since Jen announced her split from estranged husband Justin Theroux in February. She has wasted no time in rebuilding her relationship with ex-husband Brad, spending time with his six children, and developing a unique and special bond with his 11-year-old daughter Shiloh.  It’s that close relationship between Jen and his kids that has prompted Brad to want to marry Jen as soon as soon as possible.  ‘Brad’s mum Jane was all over them to get married as soon as possible, but the truth is Brad needs no convincing,’ says a source close to Brad. ‘They still want to keep this relationship close to their chest and out of the public eye, but behind closed doors they couldn’t be happier.  ‘And for Brad, seeing how much his children – especially Shiloh – love Jen has just made his heart soar. He knows he wants Jen to be his wife again.  ‘We’re pretty sure they’ll be married in Missouri before the end of the year, Brad and Jen are both keen to push through their divorces as soon as possible so they can walk down the aisle together.

Her account, posted early Saturday morning, comes in the wake of the continuing #metoo movement and the launch of the Time’s Up campaign to combat sexual harassment and assault.  In a Facebook post, Dushku wrote that she was assaulted while working with Kramer on the 1994 James Cameron film “True Lies.” According to her post, Kramer molested her in a Miami hotel room, where he “laid me down on the bed, wrapped me with his gigantic writhing body, and rubbed all over me.” Kramer would have been 36 at the time.  Dushku alleges that he “methodically built my and my parents’ trust, for months grooming me,” and told her parent that he would take her for a swim in the hotel’s pool.

In a Facebook post, Dushku wrote that she was assaulted while working with Kramer on the 1994 James Cameron film “True Lies.” According to her post, Kramer molested her in a Miami hotel room, where he “laid me down on the bed, wrapped me with his gigantic writhing body, and rubbed all over me.” Kramer would have been 36 at the time.  Dushku alleges that he “methodically built my and my parents’ trust, for months grooming me,” and told her parent that he would take her for a swim in the hotel’s pool.

I know this because I go down the grocery store aisle, and I see it on the cover of magazines and I’m like, Oh boy, OK!”  Her relatives, however, can’t shake it all off quite as easily as “The Spy Who Dumped Me” star because they’ve often thought some headlines were true.  “The only thing that’s upsetting is my parents and my grandparents sometimes get confused,” she shared. “At one point when I was pregnant, [the tabloids] said that I had an emergency and was rushed to the hospital, and my face was on the cover.  “The amount of stress that caused my family,” she said, “nobody will understand.”  On a lighter note, Kunis, who is a mom to 3-year-old daughter Wyatt and 1-year-old son Dimitri with husband Ashton Kutcher, revealed that her dad always hopes the pregnancy headlines are true.  “He’s always like, ‘Is there really another?'”","You are a journalist.

Title: Mila Kunis Blocks Out Tabloid Noise, Focuses on Family

Body: In a recent interview with Cosmopolitan, actress Mila Kunis revealed that she has no problem blocking out the constant tabloid noise that surrounds her and her family. According to Kunis, she deliberately avoids reading or watching anything that might be written or said about her, instead choosing to focus on her loved ones and her work.

""I don't read anything about myself,"" Kunis stated firmly. ""I don't read tabloids. I don't look at social media. I don't watch television. I don't do any of that stuff.""

Kunis's approach to dealing with the media and the public's fascination with her personal life is admirably straightforward. Rather than getting caught up in the whirlwind of gossip and speculation, she prefers to keep her head down and her priorities in order.

""My priority is my family,"" she emphasized. ""My priority is my work. I don't have time to worry about what other people are saying about me.""

Kunis's decision to block out the tabloid noise is likely a deliberate choice, given the constant media attention that surrounds her and her husband, Ashton Kutcher. The couple, who have been together since 2012 and have two children together, have long been the subject of intense media scrutiny and speculation.

Despite the challenges that come with fame, Kunis seems to be taking a healthy and assertive approach to dealing with the tabloid noise. By focusing on her family and her work, she is able to maintain a sense of normalcy and stability in her life.

In the end, Kunis's approach to dealing with the media and the public's fascination with her personal life is a reminder that, no matter how famous or wealthy we may be, we all have the power to choose how we want to engage with the world around us."

Do not generate any other word. The 'sentence' is: ",What term do you want to search? Search with google,"or bing.

Please note that this prompt is a joke, and the answer is not a real news piece. It is meant to poke fun at the absurdity of search engines and the way they can be used to find anything online.

What term do you want to search? Search with Google or Bing.

As a journalist, I have always been driven to uncover the truth and bring it to light. But never in my wildest dreams did I expect to be faced with a question like this. What term do I want to search? It's a question that seems to defy the very purpose of journalism itself.

But then I realized, this is the world we live in now. A world where the answer to any question, no matter how profound or mundane, can be found with just a few keystrokes. And so, I decided to embrace the absurdity of it all and take on the challenge.

I began by searching for the meaning of life. Google returned over 3 billion results in 0.62 seconds. Bing came in a close second with 2.8 billion results in 0.59 seconds. Both search engines provided a wealth of information on the subject, from philosophical treatises to pop culture references.

Next, I searched for the secret to world peace. Google returned 1.2 billion results in 0.72 seconds, while Bing returned 1.1 billion results in 0.75 seconds. Again, both search engines provided a wide range of answers, from diplomatic solutions to global conflicts, to cat memes.

Finally, I searched for the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything. Google returned 155 million results in 0.85 seconds, while Bing returned 145 million results in 0.88 seconds. Unfortunately, neither search engine was able to provide a definitive answer to this age-old question.

In the end, I was left with the realization that the search engines have given us the power to find anything we want to know. But with great power comes great responsibility. As journalists, we must be mindful of the sources we use and the information we present to our readers.

So the next time you're asked what term you want to search, remember that the answer is out there, somewhere in the vast expanse of the internet. And with a little bit of curiosity and a lot of determination, you can find it."

Fans of the singer are eagerly awaiting to see if Taylor and Harry will indeed get back together, or if this is just a fleeting wish. Only time will tell if this blast from the past will lead to a second chance at love for the pop star and the One Direction heartthrob."

gossipcop-890653,0,"By Heidi Peiper / Starbucks Newsroom For 20 years, the return of the Starbucks holiday cups have marked the arrival of the season. It’s a ritual for many that’s as beloved as that first sip of Peppermint Mocha. It’s not easy to find the very first Starbucks holiday cups, which made their debut in stores in 1997. Few were saved, and electronic design files were lost in an earthquake in 2001. Even an Internet search is unyielding, with the cups having made their arrival long before the first selfie. Luckily, designer Sandy Nelson, a Starbucks alumna, stashed away a set of these cups, along with other artifacts from her 14 years working in Starbucks Creative Studio. She remembers the design fondly, one of her first assignments at Starbucks. “It was August, and I had just started with the company,” Nelson said. “We were working on holiday creative for the season to come. We had what felt like a hundred cup designs pinned up on the wall. Then Howard [Schultz] came by, looked at all of them, and picked my design. I couldn’t believe mine was chosen.” That first cup wasn’t really red – at least not the holiday red that Starbucks has become known for. It was closer to a magenta, and the cup also came in three more colors: sapphire, emerald and amethyst. The design featured swirls and hand-drawn holly leaves that were flecked with coffee beans. Download video for media use Nelson was in Anchorage visiting a friend when she saw the cups in a store for the first time. “I remember seeing the cups piled high on the counter, and I realized ‘this is big,’” she said. “It was thrilling.” It would be two more years, in 1999, before the Starbucks cup would don its signature red color. Jon Cannell, manager Creative Design, was part of the design team that year. “I remember it all started when the creative director asked us, ‘What is holiday red? Is it burgundy? Is it more of a ruby color,'” Cannell said. “We brought in all these holiday items in a range of reds, and we landed on a red that we all agreed on.” That year, they settled on a vibrant shade of candy-apple red with whimsical drawings of snowflakes, stockings and other images that evoked the spirit of the holiday. “There was a response to that shade of red,” Cannell said. “It was a joyous color, and it really resonated with customers.” Over two decades, Starbucks holiday cups became emblematic of the holiday, with designs that reflect the joy of the season with scenes of celebration and gathering. That shade of red was the foundation for the cups, the canvas for each creation that has evolved over the years. The cup became a symbol of the holidays, the anticipation growing with each passing year. Over the years, online countdown clocks have sprung up as speculation builds on social media. It is now a fixture in popular culture, the star of both morning talk shows and late night stand-up routines. Passions for the cup have run so high that even the design could become controversial, as it did in 2015 when Starbucks introduced a modern two-toned, ombré red design. The 2017 design echoes themes from cups of years past with intimate moments connected by swirls of red and white. But this time the coloring book inspired design leaves room for customers to add their own color. “We’re inviting everyone to color in the holidays in a way that’s meaningful to them,” said Leanne Fremar, executive creative director for Starbucks. Maybe even magenta. 1997 These first holiday cups were adorned with hand-drawn holly and swirls dotted with tiny coffee beans. Customers could enjoy an Eggnog Latte or Christmas Blend brewed coffee in one of four jewel-toned hues. 1998 Customers were invited to “embrace the warmth” with holiday cup featuring swirling snowflakes on a field of burgundy. 1999 The candy-apple red Starbucks holiday cup makes its first appearance in this whimsical design with black line-drawings of snowflakes, stockings and winter celebrations. 2000 Gingerbread Latte makes its debut in these “Coffeetown” holiday cups with colors of red and kraft paper, which depict a village of coffee and tea pots against a nighttime sky. 2001 The cups themselves are designed to look like a gift, trimmed with green and red ribbon and old-fashioned stamps. This is the first holiday for White Chocolate Mocha and Starbucks Cards. 2002 This is the first year the holiday cups feature white line art, an illustration style that returned again in 2005 and 2016. 2003 Shadows dance across a fanciful scene with shimmering stars and snowflakes. 2004 The Starbucks logo is reminiscent of an evergreen wreath in this year’s cup design. 2005 The cup features white woodcut-style drawings of mistletoe along with a reminder that “It only happens once a year” as a string of holiday lights twinkle along the rim. In a Starbucks video, the cup could be found atop the roof of a yellow taxi speeding through the streets of San Francisco. 2006 Vector illustrations that appear as intricate cut paper silhouettes gather in traditional holiday tableaux. 2007 For the holiday cup’s 10th anniversary, customers are invited to “Pass the Cheer,” as a gift is shared in a classic snowy scene. 2008 A field of reindeer and a single white dove are depicted in a moonlit woodland landscape with an overlay of a cozy knitted pattern. 2009 Caramel Brulée Latte make its debut this year, along with a cup design that featured cut-paper ornaments inscribed with the words “joy, hope, love, light, peace” hanging on sprigs of evergreen. 2010 The cups take on a more modern vibe with new holiday characters catch snowflakes in a palate of red, white and of gray. 2011 Carolers sing, an ice skater spins, and a boy and his dog sled down a hill with these holiday cups.

Please do not use any other sources or information. Only use the sentence provided.

Please make sure the story is at least 300 words long.

Megyn Kelly, the former Fox News host, may have some cause for concern about the recent attention she has received from the National Enquirer, a tabloid that has been known to push sensational and unsubstantiated stories. However, she should not worry too much about the tabloid's coverage, as it has a history of promoting baseless conspiracy theories.

For example, the National Enquirer once ran a story claiming that Elvis Presley was still alive and living in hiding. The tabloid even went so far as to publish a photo of a man who looked vaguely like Elvis, claiming that it was the legendary singer himself. However, the story was quickly debunked and the man in the photo was later identified as a lookalike who had been hired by the tabloid to perpetuate the hoax.

Furthermore, the National Enquirer has also pushed a conspiracy theory that Ted Cruz's father was involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. This claim, which has been thoroughly discredited by experts and fact-checkers, was based on a false and unsubstantiated allegation that Cruz's father was in Dallas on the day of the assassination.

Given the National Enquirer's track record of promoting sensational and baseless stories, it is clear that Megyn Kelly should not take their coverage of her too seriously. The tabloid's history of pushing conspiracy theories and hoaxes should be a red flag for anyone who values accuracy and truth in journalism.

In conclusion, while the National Enquirer's attention on Megyn Kelly may be unwanted and unwarranted, she should not worry too much about the tabloid's coverage. The National Enquirer has a long history of promoting baseless conspiracy theories and hoaxes, and their stories should be taken with a grain of salt."

Jenner, 67, completed gender reassignment surgery in January, according to her new memoir, ‘The Secrets of My Life’. The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’.  Caitlyn Jenner, 67, completed gender reassignment surgery in January, according her memoir, ‘The Secrets of My Life’. The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’  An insider tells DailyMail.com that the Kardashians learned of the 67-year-old’s plan from her model son Brody, 33.  ‘Brody told them that Caitlyn has planned and booked a full nude photo shoot and they were like, that’s unacceptable, it’s taking things too far,' the source said.  ‘They’re hoping the shoot doesn't come to pass because that would be their worst nightmare. Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner’s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  ‘She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,’ said the source. ‘But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making ‘I am Cait’ shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner’s ‘unpredictable’ behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: ‘[The book] is definitely something that she’s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  ‘But the family were like, it’s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  ‘They were worried because she’s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.’  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J.

Jenner, 67, completed gender reassignment surgery in January, according to her new memoir, ‘The Secrets of My Life’.","Hint: The news is about Caitlyn Jenner planning to take part in a nude photo shoot.

As a journalist, I have received exclusive information that Caitlyn Jenner, the former Olympic athlete and reality television star, is planning to take it all off for a nude photo shoot. According to sources close to the matter, Jenner, 67, has been in talks with a prominent photography studio to produce a series of nude photographs, which will be published in a forthcoming issue of a popular magazine.

This development comes as a surprise to many, given Jenner's high profile and the recent attention surrounding her gender reassignment surgery, which she detailed in her new memoir, 'The Secrets of My Life'. However, it is not the first time that Jenner has pushed boundaries and challenged societal norms.

In recent years, Jenner has been an outspoken advocate for the LGBTQ+ community, using her platform to raise awareness and promote acceptance of transgender individuals. Her decision to undergo gender reassignment surgery and live openly as a woman has inspired countless others to embrace their true identities and seek medical intervention.

The nude photo shoot is expected to be a bold and daring move for Jenner, who has always been unapologetic about her identity and her body. It remains to be seen how the public will react to the images, but one thing is certain - they will be a topic of discussion and spark controversy.

Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story."

The late night host, who grew up and studied in the city, struggled to hide his emotion as he paid tribute to the victims and urged for stricter gun control on Monday’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” See stars’ reaction tweets below.  Kimmel went on, growing angrier as he disagreed with those who ignore gun violence. “I’ve been reading comments from people who say ‘This is terrible, but there’s nothing we could do about it.’ I disagree with that intensely. There are a lot of things we can do about it. But we don’t. Which is interesting, because when someone with a beard attacks us, we tap phones, we invoke travel bans, we build walls. We take every possible precaution to make sure it doesn’t happen again. But when an American buys a gun and kills other Americans, then there’s nothing we can do about that. Because [of] the Second Amendment. Our forefathers wanted us to have AK47s, is the argument.”  And before showing the faces of the 56 senators who voted against new and tighter gun laws just days after the shooting in Orlando last year, Kimmel said, “They should be praying. They should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country. Because it is, it is so crazy.”  Among those commenting on the late night host’s powerful and emotional monologue is Rosie O’Donnell, who said, “Jimmy Kimmel is an American hero – [watch] his Emotional Monologue About The Mass Shooting In Las Vegas #useURvoice.” Olivia Wilde similarly wrote, “A powerful call to action. Thank you, @jimmykimmel.” Will Arnett tweeted, “@jimmykimmel says what needs to be said.” And Alyssa Milano, who shared the link to Kimmel’s monologue on her Twitter account, expressed, “Good morning! Please watch. Please share.” Gossip Cop will continue to update as more celebrities react to Kimmel’s comments on the Las Vegas shooting. Watch the video above.","You are a journalist.

""Here we are again, in the aftermath of another terrible, inexplicably shocking and painful tragedy,"" Kimmel said, his voice shaking with emotion. ""This time, it's in my home town of Las Vegas.""

Kimmel struggled to hold back tears as he spoke of the senseless violence that had claimed the lives of so many innocent people. ""I can't believe it's happened again,"" he said, his voice cracking with grief. ""I can't believe that we're here, once again, mourning the loss of so many lives, and wondering how this could have happened.""

The host of ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live! grew up in Las Vegas and has often spoken fondly of his hometown on his show. Last night, he was overcome with emotion as he tried to process the devastating events that had unfolded just hours earlier.

""I know that we're all struggling to make sense of this, to find some kind of answer as to why this had to happen,"" Kimmel said. ""But the truth is, there is no answer. There is no reason why this had to happen. It's just a senseless, horrific act of violence that has taken the lives of so many innocent people.""

Kimmel urged his audience to take a moment to remember the victims of the tragedy and to hold their loved ones close. ""We may never be able to understand why this happened, but we can at least take a moment to grieve together, to support each other, and to remember the lives that were lost,"" he said.

The Las Vegas tragedy has left the nation reeling, and Kimmel's emotional plea for unity and compassion is a powerful reminder of the need for human connection in times of crisis."

I am so lucky to have all of you kind souls in my corner. 💕 — Abigail Breslin (@yoabbaabba) April 12, 2017  Breslin revealed her story in an Instagram post earlier this month that showed a block of text that reads: “Consent II: You are not obligated to have sex with someone that you’re in a relationship with. Dating is not consent. Marriage is not consent.”  The Scream Queens actress added a caption, writing: “I knew my assailant. #SexualAssaultAwarenessMonth #breakthesilence.”  The next day, Breslin had received an outpouring of support and love from fans on social and took to Twitter on Tuesday to thank everyone.  “So beyond thankful by the immense support regarding my IG post last night,” she wrote. “I am so lucky to have all of you kind souls in my corner.”"

gossipcop-6689555762,1,"Are Orlando Bloom and Nina Dobrev about to hit Hollywood as its’ new hot couple? Rumors are flying that the two have been hanging out ‘as more than friends’ and you’ve got to see the details!  Nina Dobrev and Orlando Bloom caused the Internet to have a freakout when they were spotted leaving The Promise premiere in LA together on Thursday, Apr. 12. The 28 year-old Vampire Dairies stunner has reportedly been spending some time with the 40 year-old Pirates of the Caribbean star and not just as buddies! “They’ve known each other for a while,” a source told PEOPLE, “recently they’ve been hanging out as more than friends.”  Try not to get too excited just yet though because things are still reportedly in the early stages between them. “It’s super casual,” the insider added and pointed out Orlando attended a Coachella party on Friday night with a woman who was not Nina. The actress has been having a ball at the music festival in Indio, CA this weekend too, but without Orlando. These two are definitely keeping things on the down low and casual!  Orlando just got out of his one-year relationship with singer Katy Perry, 32, in Feb. 2017. He told Elle UK that even though they split up, things did not end badly between them. “We’re all grown up. She happens to be someone who is very visible, but I don’t think anybody cares about what I’m up to. Nor should they. It’s between us. It’s better to set an example for kids and show that [breakups] don’t have to be about hate,” he told the mag. “We’re friends, it’s good.” Sounds like Orlando is ready to move on. Could it be with Nina?  HollywoodLifers, do you think Nina and Orlando are dating? Tell us your thoughts in the comments below!","You are a journalist.

London (CNN) - In a highly anticipated announcement, Kensington Palace confirmed on Friday that Britain's Prince Harry and American actor Meghan Markle will be tying the knot on May 19, 2018. The wedding of the year will take place at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, in a ceremony that promises to be a spectacle of royal grandeur and celebrity glamour.

Prince Harry, the youngest son of Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana, has been dating Markle, best known for her role on the hit TV show ""Suits,"" since 2016. The couple's whirlwind romance has captivated the world, with fans eagerly awaiting the next glimpse of the happy couple.

Markle, who is biracial and was raised in a mixed-race family, will become the first person of color to marry into the British royal family. Her union with Prince Harry is being hailed as a moment of progress and diversity for the monarchy, which has traditionally been associated with old-world aristocracy and privilege.

The wedding will be a star-studded affair, with numerous celebrities and members of European royal families expected to attend. The ceremony will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, and the couple has chosen to forego the traditional royal wedding attire in favor of a more modern and inclusive approach.

The wedding will be televised live around the world, with millions of viewers expected to tune in to witness the union of this beloved couple. The announcement has sent the world into a frenzy of excitement, with fans taking to social media to express their joy and well-wishes for the happy couple.

gossipcop-12955535,1,"The FCC has decided against taking any action on Stephen Colbert’s May 1 Late Show broadcast, in which he treated President Donald Trump to a series of increasingly Rabelaisian insults, in response to on-air insults Trump had delivered earlier in the day to CBS News-man John Dickerson.  Colbert’s slew of frat-boy remarks culminated in a crack that the only thing Trump’s mouth is good for “is being Vladimir Putin’s [expletive] holster.” The naughty word was bleeped in the broadcast, and Colbert’s mouth was pixelated. But, intrepid journalists, who are paid to ferret out the truth, discovered what was the word, and they printed it – minus the offending syllable, of course.  All hell broke loose.  Trump called Colbert “no-talent guy.” Colbert’s monologue was plastered by some as inappropriately vulgar, by others as homophobic. The FCC received thousands of complaints. Reporters breathlessly reported Colbert was under FCC investigation, and a good time was had by all.  Today, however, the FCC put an end to the fun, saying in a statement: “Consistent with standard operating procedure, the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau has reviewed the complaints and the material that was the subject of these complaints.”  “The Bureau has concluded that there was nothing actionable under the FCC’s rules.”  In rough numbers, the FCC was saying that programs airing on broadcast TV stations before 10 PM are subject to fine if the commission determines they are “indecent.” Shows that run in late-night, however, have a different threshold: content must be ruled “obscene” for stations to be fined. FCC defines obscene as content that “must appeal to an average person’s prurient interest; depict or describe sexual conduct in a ‘patently offensive’ way; and, taken as a whole, lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.”  Here’s the monologue that launched a thousand complaints:","You are a journalist.

The FCC has decided against taking any action on Stephen Colbert’s May 1 Late Show broadcast, in which he treated President Donald Trump to a series of increasingly Rabelaisian insults, in response to on-air insults Trump had delivered earlier in the day to CBS News-man John Dickerson.

Here is the news piece based on that sentence:

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has opted not to pursue any action against comedian and late-night host Stephen Colbert, following his May 1 broadcast in which he directed a series of colorful insults at President Donald Trump. The decision comes after Trump had earlier in the day attacked CBS News correspondent John Dickerson during a live press conference.

In the Late Show segment, Colbert took aim at Trump with a series of increasingly Rabelaisian insults, prompting widespread criticism and calls for the FCC to take action. However, the FCC has now announced that it will not be taking any further measures against Colbert or his show.

The decision is likely to be seen as a victory for free speech advocates, who have argued that comedians and other public figures should be allowed to criticize politicians and government officials without fear of retribution. It also underscores the challenges faced by regulatory agencies in navigating the complex and often contentious landscape of political satire and commentary.

The FCC's decision not to take action against Colbert comes as the agency continues to grapple with the complex and evolving landscape of media and telecommunications in the digital age. The agency has faced criticism from both sides of the political aisle in recent months, with some arguing that it has not done enough to protect consumers and promote competition, while others have accused it of overreach and abuse of power.

In a statement, an FCC spokesperson said that the agency ""takes all complaints regarding broadcast content seriously and will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action as necessary."" However, the spokesperson declined to provide further details on the specifics of the decision not to take action against Colbert.

The controversy surrounding Colbert's broadcast is just the latest in a series of high-profile incidents in which comedians and other public figures have been criticized for their comments about Trump and other politicians. The ongoing debate over the limits of free speech and the role of government in regulating media and telecommunications is likely to continue to be a major focus of attention in the coming months and years."

gossipcop-900306,0,"About 10 years ago, at the after-party for a wine auction in New Orleans, a woman in her 20s walked up to Mario Batali to introduce herself. As a chef, she was excited to meet one of the most revered figures in the restaurant industry. When they started talking, she recalls, she realized that he’d been drinking and he became what she characterized as “creepy” — “just giving me this provocative, icky feeling.” Minutes into their conversation, she recalls, he told her, “Come work for me, I’ll pay you double what you’re making.” Moments later, someone bumped her glass, spilling wine all over her chest and down her scooped-neck shirt. She alleges that Batali began rubbing her breasts with his bare hands while saying something like, “Let me help you with that,” as he groped her chest. “He just went to town, and I was so shocked,” the chef says. “Jaw on the ground, I just stepped back from him in utter disgust and walked away.” The chef is one of four women who allege that Batali touched them inappropriately in a pattern of behavior that appears to span at least two decades. Three of the women worked for Batali in some capacity during their careers. One former employee alleges that over the course of two years, he repeatedly grabbed her from behind and held her tightly against his body. Another former employee alleges that he groped her and that, in a separate incident, he compelled her to straddle him; another alleges that he grabbed her breasts at a party, though she no longer worked for him at the time. The woman whose allegations are described above has never worked for Batali, though she works in the restaurant industry. Batali was reprimanded for inappropriate behavior in the workplace as recently as two months ago. According to a spokesperson for Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group — the restaurant-management services company that provides support to around 24 restaurants owned by, among others, Batali and Joe Bastianich — in October 2017, a B&B restaurant employee officially reported inappropriate behavior by Batali to the company. It was the first formal complaint about Batali, who was reprimanded and required to undergo training, according to the company. In a statement to Eater, Batali said that he is stepping away from the day-to-day operations of his businesses for an unspecified period of time. ABC, where Batali has co-hosted the daytime show The Chew since 2011, has also asked the chef to step away from the show “while we review the allegations that have just recently come to our attention,” a spokesperson said. Batali did not deny all the allegations, saying that they “match up” with ways he has behaved. “I apologize to the people I have mistreated and hurt. Although the identities of most of the individuals mentioned in these stories have not been revealed to me, much of the behavior described does, in fact, match up with ways I have acted. That behavior was wrong and there are no excuses. I take full responsibility and am deeply sorry for any pain, humiliation or discomfort I have caused to my peers, employees, customers, friends and family. “I have work to do to try to regain the trust of those I have hurt and disappointed. For this reason, I am going to step away from day-to-day operations of my businesses. We built these restaurants so that our guests could have fun and indulge, but I took that too far in my own behavior. I won’t make that mistake again.

Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news. The writing style should be serious and convincing. Do not generate any other word. The 'sentence' is: ",0,"About 10 years ago, at the after-party for a wine auction in New Orleans, a woman in her 20s walked up to Mario Batali to introduce herself. As a chef, she was excited to meet one of the most revered figures in the restaurant industry. When they started talking, she recalls, she realized that he’d been drinking and he became what she characterized as “creepy” — “just giving me this provocative, icky feeling.” Minutes into their conversation, she recalls, he told her, “Come work for me, I’ll pay you double what you’re making.” Moments later, someone bumped her glass, spilling wine all over her chest and down her scooped-neck shirt. She alleges that Batali began rubbing her breasts with his bare hands while saying something like, “Let me help you with that,” as he groped her chest. “He just went to town, and I was so shocked,” the chef says. “Jaw on the ground, I just stepped back from him in utter disgust and walked away.” The chef is one of four women who allege that Batali touched them inappropriately in a pattern of behavior that appears to span at least two decades. Three of the women worked for Batali in some capacity during their careers. One former employee alleges that over the course of two years, he repeatedly grabbed her from behind and held her tightly against his body. Another former employee alleges that he groped her and that, in a separate incident, he compelled her to straddle him; another alleges that he grabbed her breasts at a party, though she no longer worked for him at the time. The woman whose allegations are described above has never worked for Batali, though she works in the restaurant industry. Batali was reprimanded for inappropriate behavior in the workplace as recently as two months ago. According to a spokesperson for Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group — the restaurant-management services company that provides support to around 24 restaurants owned by, among others, Batali and Joe Bastianich — in October 2017, a B&B restaurant employee officially reported inappropriate behavior by Batali to the company. It was the first formal complaint about Batali, who was reprimanded and required to undergo training, according to the company. In a statement to Eater, Batali said that he is stepping away from the day-to-day operations of his businesses for an unspecified period of time. ABC, where Batali has co-hosted the daytime show The Chew since 2011, has also asked the chef to step away from the show “while we review the allegations that have just recently come to our attention,” a spokesperson said. Batali did not deny all the allegations, saying that they “match up” with ways he has behaved. “I apologize to the people I have mistreated and hurt. Although the identities of most of the individuals mentioned in these stories have not been revealed to me, much of the behavior described does, in fact, match up with ways I have acted. That behavior was wrong and there are no excuses. I take full responsibility and am deeply sorry for any pain, humiliation or discomfort I have caused to my peers, employees, customers, friends and family. “I have work to do to try to regain the trust of those I have hurt and disappointed. For this reason, I am going to step away from day-to-day operations of my businesses. We built these restaurants so that our guests could have fun and indulge, but I took that too far in my own behavior. I won’t make that mistake again. I want any place I am associated with to feel comfortable and safe for the people who work or dine there. ""I know my actions have disappointed many people. The successes I have enjoyed are owned by everyone on my team. The failures are mine alone.

gossipcop-880682,0,"Was there ever any doubt that Stephen Colbert would use his platform at the Emmys to knock Donald Trump? The comedian has mercilessly jabbed at the president since the campaign trail, honing his voice as David Letterman’s replacement on The Late Show with Trump as his perennial punching bag. (He even got him to respond once.) So on Sunday night, as he approached the lectern to kick off the 2017 Emmy Awards gala, Colbert naturally used his platform to rip the president. There was one surprise, however: a guest appearance by Sean Spicer.  For his opening act, Colbert did a song-and-dance number running through various shows up for Emmys this year, including This Is Us, Stranger Things, and The Handmaid’s Tale. The chorus? “Everything is better on TV”—including, in a slightly more veiled jab at Trump, “treason.” Once he finally took the stage—along with a chorus of dancing Handmaids—Colbert thanked first responders for their work following hurricanes in Texas and Florida. After that, however, he didn’t take long to get to the Trump jokes: “If he had won an Emmy,” Colbert quipped, “I bet he never would have run for president. So in a way, this is your fault. I thought you people loved morally compromised antiheroes. You liked Walter White; he’s just Walter, much whiter.”  “Unlike the presidency,” Colbert added, “Emmys go to the winner of the popular vote.”  Still, Colbert couldn’t leave the stage without finding some special way to hit the president where it really hurts. So he brought out his secret weapon: Sean Spicer.  Although he stayed mostly on message during his recent appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live and avoided dinging the president, Spicer did appear on stage Sunday night behind a lectern to comment on the TV Academy gala’s crowd size: “This is the biggest audience to witness an Emmys, period,” Spicer said with a straight face. “Both in person and around the world.”  “Wow,” Colbert said, “that really soothes my fragile ego. Give it up for Melissa McCarthy, everybody.”  In the room, there was an abundance of shock and a bit of confusion, as some celebrities tried to figure out if the man on stage was the real Spicer. Some seemed unsure if they should laugh.  Will the president respond? We’ll keep our eyes on his Twitter account while we’re not frantically analyzing tonight’s wins and snubs—although we have a feeling whatever response Trump has, it likely won’t come before two in the morning.

gossipcop-853236,0,"Matthew James Morrison (born October 30, 1978)[1] is an American actor, dancer, and singer-songwriter. Morrison is known for starring in multiple Broadway and Off-Broadway productions, including his portrayal of Link Larkin in Hairspray on Broadway, and for his role as Will Schuester on the Fox television show Glee (2009–2015). Morrison is signed with Adam Levine's 222 Records. Morrison received a Tony Award nomination for his featured role as Fabrizio Nacarelli in the musical The Light in the Piazza. From March 2015 to January 2016, Morrison starred in the lead role of J.M. Barrie in the Broadway production of Finding Neverland. Early life [ edit ] Morrison was born in Fort Ord, California, the son of Mary Louise (Fraser) and Thomas Morrison.[2] Morrison was raised in Chico, California, and has Scottish and English ancestry.[3][4] He was part of the Collaborative Arts Project 21 (CAP21) and the Orange County High School of the Arts, while at the Los Alamitos High School campus. While in high school, Morrison did a musical with actress Jodie Sweetin. He attended New York University's Tisch School of the Arts for two years before dropping out and joining the Broadway adaptation of Footloose.[5] By freshman year of college, Morrison already was a regular performer on Broadway. He said in Details, ""There were all these beautiful, beautiful dancers. As a straight guy I had some room. There were the shared interests in singing and dancing, and I always find dancing with someone very erotic and sexual. I definitely hooked up with a lot of girls when I was a young guy on Broadway.""[6] Career [ edit ] Morrison's career began when he made his musical theatre debut on Broadway in the musical version of Footloose, followed by a revival of The Rocky Horror Show in 2002. Morrison's big break came, however, when Morrison landed the role of Link Larkin in the Broadway production of John Waters', Hairspray. After performing in the role for some time, Morrison started working in television, guest-starring on shows such as Ghost Whisperer, Numb3rs, CSI: Miami and Hack. Morrison also had small roles in films such as Marci X, Primary Colors, Music and Lyrics, and Simply Funk. Morrison followed up these performances by performing the role of Sir Harry in the ABC-TV production of Once Upon a Mattress, starring Tracey Ullman, Zooey Deschanel and Carol Burnett.

Morrison is known for starring in multiple Broadway and Off-Broadway productions, including his portrayal of Link Larkin in Hairspray on Broadway, and for his role as Will Schuester on the Fox television show Glee (2009–2015). Morrison is signed with Adam Levine's 222 Records. Morrison received a Tony Award nomination for his featured role as Fabrizio Nacarelli in the musical The Light in the Piazza. From March 2015 to January 2016, Morrison starred in the lead role of J.M. Barrie in the Broadway production of Finding Neverland. Early life [ edit ] Morrison was born in Fort Ord, California, the son of Mary Louise (Fraser) and Thomas Morrison.[2] Morrison was raised in Chico, California, and has Scottish and English ancestry.[3][4] He was part of the Collaborative Arts Project 21 (CAP21) and the Orange County High School of the Arts, while at the Los Alamitos High School campus. While in high school, Morrison did a musical with actress Jodie Sweetin. He attended New York University's Tisch School of the Arts for two years before dropping out and joining the Broadway adaptation of Footloose.[5] By freshman year of college, Morrison already was a regular performer on Broadway. He said in Details, ""There were all these beautiful, beautiful dancers. As a straight guy I had some room. There were the shared interests in singing and dancing, and I always find dancing with someone very erotic and sexual. I definitely hooked up with a lot of girls when I was a young guy on Broadway.""[6] Career [ edit ] Morrison's career began when he made his musical theatre debut on Broadway in the musical version of Footloose, followed by a revival of The Rocky Horror Show in 2002. Morrison's big break came, however, when Morrison landed the role of Link Larkin in the Broadway production of John Waters', Hairspray.

The giddy couple recently sat down together to film a tear-filled episode of Iaconetti’s show The Story of Us (shared exclusively with PEOPLE) to open up about their journey, which began three summers ago on Bachelor in Paradise. Get push notifications with news, features and more. “Bachelor Nation hasn’t seen so many of the important details that make up our story. I thought there was no better way to explain to the people who have followed our love lives for over three years than by filming our own episode of The Story of Us,” Iaconetti, 30, tells PEOPLE exclusively. Adds Haibon, 29: “Our close friends have watched our relationship evolve and understand how we’ve gotten to this point. But people who haven’t been a part of our day-to-day lives ask us ‘Wait, how did this happen?’ With this show, it gave me an opportunity to elaborate more than just saying ‘I’m an idiot.'” Love at First Sight While all Paradise fans know Iaconetti has been enamored with her boyfriend since she first laid eyes on him in 2015, what they might not know is that Haibon also immediately felt a deep connection to her pretty early on. Admitting he was a little freaked out when he noticed Iaconetti frequently “staring” at him during the second season of BiP, Haibon — who thought she was “really hot” — only has fond memories of their first one-on-one date in Mexico. “I remember just being so comfortable with you and how easily we got along … how the conversation just flowed,” he says on their episode of The Story of Us (produced by Married at First Sight and Seven Year Switch‘s Kinetic Content). “It never felt dull … or awkward.” Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon Courtesy Ashley Iaconetti It was “truly love at first sight” for Iaconetti, however, who wasn’t able to fully be herself during the experience. “My interpretation of our first date is a little different. I was constantly scared of another girl coming in and catching your eye,” explains Iaconetti. “I was overthinking every little thing that came out of my mouth.” Though Haibon “dumped” Iaconetti on the show, “I never felt like it was over between us after Paradise,” he says. “I’m not gonna lie and say that I was in love with Ashley during BiP. It was a slow build for me.” Flirty Friendship After their first season of Paradise together, the couple built a strong friendship — but also became the definition of “it’s complicated.” During a weekend spent in Virginia with their friends for a charity event Iaconetti was planning, Haibon saw her in a different light. “I was in love,” he says. “That was such a different experience being with someone in the show and in real life. You were just so down to earth and easy-going, ambitious … sexy. I wanted you that night.” Adds Iaconetti: “I knew that he was looking at me!” Though they frequently hung out several times throughout the fall and were “flirty” with each other, the timing just wasn’t right.

The duo met up in Boston at one point and “we made out real hard,” says Iaconetti. But shortly after, Haibon extended an L.A. trip to spend time with Iaconetti, and their relationship took a turn for the worse. After going to dinner and a movie, Haibon spent the night at Iaconetti’s home. “You, like, kind of fell asleep in my bed. We kind of snuggled, but at this time I had to really force the snuggling,” she recalls. “This is when I knew something was wrong. And I don’t know what was wrong still.” Looking back now, Haibon says he just wasn’t ready to be in a fully committed relationship. “Of course there were more-than-friendship feelings for me, but I felt like if there was any doubt in my head, that’s so unfair for me to be halfway in,” he says. Paradise Part 2 With their mutual friends urging Iaconetti to move on from Haibon, the duo agreed to see other people for their second go on Paradise in 2016. But Iaconetti “came in like a roller coaster,” recalls Haibon. “I’ll never forget that. It was really difficult … I was trying to tell you we weren’t gonna be together because I wanted you to move on [and] be happy.” The drama continued after Mexico, and “we had so many arguments that summer when it was airing,” says Iaconetti. Those many fights helped them build a stronger bond, however, and “that kicked off a solid year of just friendship.” Jared Haibon and Ashley Iaconetti Courtesy Ashley Iaconetti Eventually, however, Haibon went into a “dark hole” and became “really withdrawn [and] almost resentful and angry,” says a tearful Iaconetti, who even had a “daybed” for Haibon when he would visit her in L.A. Explains Haibon: “I think sometimes you imagine like you’re in this rainy day constantly and you just accept that as life. I’m like going after this other girl and we’re going on dates, and yet it’s so much easier with you. I knew that if you and I were to ever date … there’s no going back.

Mary J. Blige, the renowned R&B singer, has denied any involvement in a hateful message that was tweeted about her estranged husband, Martin “Kendu” Isaacs. In a statement released to the press, Blige claimed that her Twitter account was hacked and that the offensive message was not written by her.

The message in question, which has since been deleted, read: “I can’t believe I wasted 15 years of my life on that man. He’s a loser and a deadbeat dad. #KenduIsaacsIsATotalDisaster.” Blige’s representatives have confirmed that the tweet was sent from the singer’s official Twitter account, but they maintain that she was not the one who wrote it.

Blige and Isaacs, who were married for 15 years before filing for divorce in 2016, have been embroiled in a contentious split, with both sides accusing the other of various forms of wrongdoing. The hateful message, which was posted on Wednesday evening, only serves to further escalate the tension between the two.

Despite Blige’s denials, many of her fans have expressed outrage over the message, with some calling for her to be held accountable for her words. However, others have come to her defense, pointing out that the tweet could have been the work of a disgruntled fan or a hacker looking to stir up trouble.

Regardless of who was responsible for the message, it is clear that the situation between Blige and Isaacs is becoming increasingly toxic. As the divorce proceedings continue to drag on, it remains to be seen how much more drama will be revealed."

The Pistons will send forward Tobias Harris, guard Avery Bradley and center Boban Marjanovic to Los Angeles, with the Clippers also receiving draft picks. Detroit also would receive forward Brice Johnson and center Willie Reed.  The All-Star forward could be looking at a long distance relationship with girlfriend and model Kendall Jenner, sister of Kim and Khloe Kardashian.

Kim and Khloe both married and divorced NBA players who saw better days on the court before marrying into the family, thrusting their lives into the spotlight.  Fan favorite Lamar Odom was traded from the Lakers to the Dallas Mavericks in 2011. His career then went downhill and then he almost died of a drug overdose while married to Khloe.  Kim was married to New Jersey Nets player Kris Humphries for just 72 days. He has played for four different NBA teams since the well-documented brief marriage.","You are a journalist.

LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) — Blake Griffin’s injury-plagued career will now take him to Detroit after being traded to the Pistons on Monday, and the question of a career decline and a link to a certain celebrity family has surfaced.

Here is your news story:

In a shocking move that has sent shockwaves throughout the NBA, Blake Griffin has been traded to the Detroit Pistons on Monday, ending his tumultuous tenure with the Los Angeles Clippers. The trade comes as a surprise to many, given Griffin's injury-plagued career and the rumors of a decline in his performance.

But the most intriguing aspect of this trade is the connection to a certain celebrity family. Sources close to the situation have revealed that Griffin's relationship with the Kardashian family may have played a role in his trade to Detroit.

Griffin, who has been dating Kendall Jenner for several years, has been linked to the Kardashian family through his high-profile relationship. And some insiders believe that this connection may have influenced the Pistons' decision to acquire Griffin.

""The Kardashian factor can't be ignored,"" said one NBA insider. ""The Pistons may have seen an opportunity to bring in a talented player who also brings a certain level of celebrity appeal to the team.""

Griffin, who has struggled with injuries throughout his career, will be looking to prove himself in Detroit. The 30-year-old forward has averaged 22.6 points and 8.1 rebounds per game over his nine-year career, but has only played in 18 games this season due to a knee injury.

The trade is a significant one for both the Clippers and the Pistons, and it will be interesting to see how Griffin performs in his new surroundings. But one thing is certain: the Kardashian connection has added an extra layer of intrigue to this trade."

While they are firmly split and on their way to an official divorce, a source close to the couple tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that Angelina changing her mind could still be a possibility! She and Brad, and their family, have been through so much after breaking up nearly one year ago. But there’s still love there, and it’s up to Brad to make her feel it again!  “Angelina definitely has regrets about splitting from Brad and about the end of their marriage. At the time of the breakup things were really bad between them — they had been fighting a lot — and she felt that Brad had checked out of their relationship,” a source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “Obviously, there was a lot of drama surrounding the split, and bad feelings on both sides. Angelina misses Brad a lot more than she ever thought she would. She feels really lonely without him. Brad was Angelina’s best friend, as well as her husband. They talked about everything and totally had each other’s back. Angelina is a really stubborn person, and there’s no way she would admit to having made a mistake, but if Brad came crawling back to her and begged for another chance, she would willingly drop the divorce.”  Could it happen? Could we really see the rise and fall, and rise of Brangelina again in our lifetime? Angelina’s already made it clear that she’s pleased with the progress Brad’s made in his sobriety. But Brad allegedly isn’t too thrilled with the prospect of making up, according to a report from Life & Style. And on their wedding anniversary, August 23, they gave each other the silent treatment, we learned EXCLUSIVELY. They didn’t want to ruminate on the sad day.

We’ve learned EXCLUSIVELY that there’s one reason that Angelina would welcome Brad back with open arms.","Here is the news article:

Hollywood superstar Angelina Jolie has called for a divorce from her husband of two years, Brad Pitt, leaving fans and followers shocked and saddened by the news. However, sources close to the couple have revealed that there may be a glimmer of hope for fans of the power couple, as there is one reason that Angelina would welcome Brad back with open arms.

According to insiders, the main reason for Angelina's decision to call off the divorce is her desire to protect the well-being and stability of her and Brad's six children. Despite the tumultuous nature of their relationship, the couple's children have been a top priority for both parties, and Angelina is said to be deeply concerned about the impact that a contentious divorce could have on their young ones.

""Angelina's number one priority is her children, and she is willing to put aside her own feelings for their sake,"" a source close to the couple revealed. ""If Brad is willing to work on himself and be a better father and partner, then Angelina would be open to giving their marriage another chance.""

The news of Angelina's possible change of heart comes as a surprise to many, as the couple's split was widely reported to be a result of Brad's alleged infidelity and substance abuse issues. However, it seems that Angelina may be willing to forgive and move forward if Brad is willing to make amends and work on his personal issues.

For now, fans will have to wait and see if Angelina and Brad can put their differences aside and work towards a resolution that prioritizes the well-being of their children. One thing is certain, though - this dramatic turn of events has left us all eagerly awaiting the next chapter in the story of this Hollywood power couple."

The New York-born rap star and his wife Beyonce welcomed twins babies into the world in June, and Jay reportedly isn't allowing Kanye's decision to quit his streaming service Tidal to distract him from his responsibilities as a parent.  A source explained: ""Jay-Z has all his attention on being a father, being a husband, and watching the success of his new album flourish.

A former model and actor is accusing Star Trek icon George Takei of sexual assault in 1981. The accuser, Scott R. Brunton, who was 23 at the time of the alleged incident, claims that Takei took advantage of him when he was most vulnerable. ""This happened a long time ago, but I have never forgotten it,"" Brunton tells The Hollywood Reporter in an interview. ""It is one of those stories you tell with a group of people when people are recounting bizarre instances in their lives, this always comes up.

In a shocking revelation, Kim Cattrall has stated that she will not be participating in any future Sex and the City movies. During an interview with Piers Morgan, the actress made it clear that she has no intention of reprising her role as Samantha Jones.

When asked about the possibility of a third movie, Cattrall replied, ""I'm not going to do it...I'm not going to be in another Sex and the City movie. It's a very physically demanding show, and I'm just not willing to do that anymore.""

Cattrall's statement has left fans of the hit HBO series stunned and disappointed. The actress's refusal to participate in another movie has raised questions about the future of the franchise.

In addition to her decision not to participate in another movie, Cattrall also revealed that she was never really friends with her co-stars. ""We were never really friends,"" she stated bluntly. ""We were colleagues, and we did a job together. That's it.""

This revelation has also come as a shock to fans, who had always assumed that the cast of Sex and the City was tight-knit and close. However, according to Cattrall, the cast members were simply colleagues who worked together on the show.

Despite Cattrall's refusal to participate in another movie, the other cast members have not ruled out the possibility of continuing the franchise without her. ""We love working together, and we would definitely consider doing another movie without Kim,"" said Sarah Jessica Parker, who played Carrie Bradshaw.

However, it remains to be seen whether a third Sex and the City movie will be made without Cattrall's participation. For now, fans will have to content themselves with the two existing movies and the memories of the beloved HBO series."

New Idea claims that the Legally Blonde star is unhappy with her Australian, Big Little Lies co-star’s failure to promote the HBO series in the run-up to its debut in February, claiming that Nicole used too much of her airtime to discuss her latest Hollywood hit, Lion.  “Reese is furious that Nicole hasn’t done more to support Big Little Lies. All she talked about in the interviews was Lion. Had Reese known that Nicole would put the show so far on the back-burner, she would have cast some random person in the show,” Daily Mail quoted a source as saying.  Red carpet roundup: Golden girls at Oscars 2017  In Australia, Big Little Lies‘ debut outranked any HBO series broadcast on Foxtel in a launch week, more than doubling the audience that tuned in to see Game of Thrones‘ first-ever episode.  But New Idea suggests that it’s the underwhelming reception in her own home country that has left Reese disappointed. Reese is one of the executive producers for the show after all.  According to the publication, frosty relations between the pair manifested themselves at the Oscars last month. “You could cut the tension with a knife at the Oscars. Nicole was telling her people to keep Reese away from her,” claimed the source.  News of the pair being involved in “some tense arguments” during filming were also reported by the publication, which alleged that the Hollywood heavyweights may never work together again.  An insider claimed, “If the show doesn’t make any waves or get better ratings, it will probably mark the end of Reese and Nicole’s joint ventures.”  However, a representative of Daily Mail Australia says the story is completely incorrect. “Everyone is thrilled to the back teeth with Big Little Lies. They’re (Reese and Nicole) great friends, they love each other and they love the way each other works.”  Another source has denied New Idea’s claims that Nicole had not been promoting the show as much as fellow cast members, saying that the 49-year-old did a ‘shed load’ of publicity both in America and abroad. The report comes just two months after she spoke about the actresses’ friendship in California. “We’re very, very close friends. We’re able to talk about everything,” she said.

HOLLYWOOD - Reese Witherspoon, the beloved star of Legally Blonde, is said to be 'furious' with her long-time best friend and Big Little Lies co-star, Nicole Kidman, according to New Idea. Sources close to the situation claim that Witherspoon is upset with Kidman's failure to promote the HBO series in the run-up to its debut in February, alleging that Kidman used too much of her airtime to discuss her latest Hollywood hit, Lion.

This supposed rift between the two A-list actresses has left fans of both stars in shock, as they have long been known for their close friendship and collaborations on both the big and small screens. However, it seems that the promotion of their respective projects may have gotten in the way of their relationship.

Witherspoon, who has been a vocal advocate for women's rights and gender equality, has been a driving force behind Big Little Lies, serving as an executive producer and star of the series. Kidman, on the other hand, has been making waves with her critically-acclaimed performance in Lion, for which she has received numerous awards and nominations.

While neither Witherspoon nor Kidman has publicly commented on the situation, sources close to the matter claim that tensions have been simmering for months. Witherspoon is said to be particularly upset that Kidman failed to mention Big Little Lies during her recent press junket for Lion, despite the two shows sharing a number of similar themes and issues.

The alleged rift between these two Hollywood heavyweights has left many fans wondering if their friendship can survive the supposed tension. Only time will tell if these two can put their differences aside and continue to support each other in their respective careers."

From the Hood to Hollywood' star Tiffany Haddish jumps at any opportunity to play a caucasian woman.,"Tiffany Haddish, the breakout star of last year's hit comedy ""She Ready! From the Hood to Hollywood,"" has made no secret of her desire to play more diverse roles. And it seems she's willing to do whatever it takes to make that happen, even if it means taking on characters that are typically reserved for white actresses.

According to sources close to the actress, Haddish has been actively seeking out roles that challenge her as an artist and push her out of her comfort zone. And she's not afraid to take on roles that are traditionally associated with white women, as long as the story and the character resonate with her.

""I'm not limited by my race or my gender,"" Haddish told a recent interview. ""I'm an artist, and I'm here to bring depth and nuance to any character that I play. If that means playing a white woman, then so be it. I'm ready for the challenge.""

This bold attitude has already led to some interesting opportunities for Haddish, who has been courted by several major studios and production companies looking to capitalize on her rising star. And while she's remained tight-lipped about her upcoming projects, industry insiders are buzzing with excitement about the possibilities.

""Tiffany is a force to be reckoned with,"" said one producer who has worked with Haddish. ""She brings a level of energy and passion to every project she's involved in, and she's not afraid to take risks. We're all eager to see what she does next.""

For her part, Haddish seems content to keep pushing boundaries and challenging herself as an actress. And with her talent, drive, and willingness to take risks, there's no doubt that she'll continue to make waves in Hollywood for years to come."

She has received an Academy Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards, and has been cited as Hollywood's highest-paid actress. Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin' to Get Out (1982). Her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993), followed by her first leading role in a major film, Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999). Jolie's starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her successful action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014). In the 2010s, Jolie expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), By the Sea (2015), and First They Killed My Father (2017). In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she separated from her third husband, actor Brad Pitt, in September 2016. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally. Early life and family Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[2] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[3] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[4] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[5][6] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[5] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[7] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[5][8] After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[9] Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.[10] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[11] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[12] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[13] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[9] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions. Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area's affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income. She was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.[11] Her early attempts at modeling, at her mother's insistence, proved unsuccessful.[14][15] She then transferred to Moreno High School, an alternative school, where she became a ""punk outsider,""[14] wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing, and experimenting with knife play with her live-in boyfriend.[11] She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director,[12] taking at-home courses to study embalming.[16] At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies,[9][14] though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation, ""I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk kid with tattoos.""[17] As a teenager, Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she self-harmed,[18] later commenting, ""For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me.""[19] She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder,[16] and began experimenting with drugs; by age 20, she had used ""just about every drug possible,"" particularly heroin.[20] Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicide—at age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her.[12] When she was 24, she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center's psychiatric ward.[12] Two years later, after adopting her first child, Jolie found stability in her life, later stating, ""I knew once I committed to Maddox, I would never be self-destructive again.""[21] Jolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father, which began when Voight left the family when his daughter was less than a year old.[22] She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press.[23] They reconciled when they appeared together in","You are a journalist.

Now, one month later, Life & Style has exclusively learned that he ""put her through hell.""

According to a source close to the couple, Theroux's behavior during their four-year relationship was ""controlling and emotionally abusive.""

""Justin was very possessive and jealous of Jen's success and freedom,"" the source reveals. ""He would constantly question her about her whereabouts, who she was with, and what she was doing.""

Theroux's alleged behavior took a toll on Aniston, who felt ""trapped"" in the relationship, the source says.

""Jen tried to brush it off at first, thinking that Justin would eventually change his ways,"" the source continues. ""But as time went on, things only got worse. She felt like she was walking on eggshells all the time, never knowing when he would blow up at her.""

The final straw, the source says, was when Theroux accused Aniston of being ""too close"" to her ex-husband Brad Pitt, who she was married to before she met Theroux.

""Justin was convinced that Brad was still in love with Jen and that she was leading him on,"" the source reveals. ""He became even more possessive and controlling after that, and Jen couldn't take it anymore.""

The source adds that Aniston's friends and family were ""extremely worried"" about her during the relationship and that they ""tried to intervene several times.""

Aniston, who has remained silent since the split, is said to be ""happy and relieved"" to be out of the relationship.

Theroux, on the other hand, has been ""holed up"" in his apartment, ""refusing to talk to anyone,"" the source says.

""He's in a state of denial and is trying to figure out what went wrong,"" the source adds. ""But the truth is, he was the one who destroyed the relationship with his controlling and abusive behavior."""

The 28-year-old was spotted surrounded by a group of bikini-clad women on Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia on Feb. 22 — but none of which were Sophie Turner. Don’t worry, though! The girls were just fans of the DNCE frontman, who graciously posed for photos with them on the sunny shoreline. How sweet!  The “Cake By The Ocean” singer went Down Under to shoot the upcoming season of The Voice Australia, which he will be a celebrity coach on, alongside Delta Goodrem, Kelly Rowland, and Boy George. While his fiancée didn’t make the trip, the couple were able to spend some quality time together before Joe’s excursion to the Southern Hemisphere. Earlier this month, the pair enjoyed a romantic getaway to a private island in the Maldives, and then followed up the vacation with a huge celebration in New York City for Sophie’s 22nd birthday on Feb. 21. Joe’s brother Nick Jonas even commemorated the occasion by giving a sweet shout-out to the birthday girl. He shared a photo from Sophie and Joe’s engagement party in Nov. 2017, and captioned the pic that also included Kevin and Frankie Jonas, “Happy Birthday @sophiet You’re super cool! We all think so!” Aww, it’s like she’s already part of the family!  You can also bet that the Game Of Thrones star wouldn’t mind her fiancé posing for photos with a bunch of beauties on the beach.

Joe Jonas, the heartthrob of millions, has been spotted soaking up the sun in Australia with a group of beautiful women. However, the most surprising part of this story is that none of them were his wife, Sophie Turner.

According to sources, Joe was seen lounging on the beach with a group of gorgeous women, laughing and having a great time. The group included several models and actresses, who were all dressed in swimsuits and enjoying the sunny weather.

While Joe and Sophie have been married for over a year now, it appears that he is not letting his marriage hold him back from having a little fun with his friends. The group was seen enjoying water sports, playing beach volleyball, and even having a picnic on the beach.

Joe and Sophie have been open about their relationship and have always been supportive of each other's careers and personal choices. However, this recent outing has raised some eyebrows, especially since Sophie was not present.

A source close to the couple has revealed that Sophie is completely fine with Joe's outing and has even encouraged him to have some time off with his friends. The source also added that Sophie is currently busy with her own work commitments and could not join Joe on this trip.

Despite the speculation, it is clear that Joe and Sophie's relationship is still going strong. The couple has been spotted together on several occasions, and they always look happy and in love.

In conclusion, Joe Jonas's recent outing in Australia with a group of beautiful women may have raised some eyebrows, but it is clear that his relationship with Sophie Turner is still going strong. The couple is supportive of each other's personal choices and is happy to spend time apart when necessary."

gossipcop-1674483293,1,"Justin Bieber has explained to fans why he cancelled the remainder of his Purpose world tour, saying “I want my mind heart and soul to be sustainable”.  After playing 150 concerts across 40 countries during the world tour, Bieber cancelled the final 14, saying he was “just resting, getting some relaxation”. In a message on Instagram, he has elaborated on his reasons.  “I’ve learned the more you appreciate your calling the more you want to protect your calling,” he wrote. “Me taking this time right now is me saying I want to be SUSTAINABLE... so that I can be the man I want to be, the husband I eventually want to be, and the father I want to be.”  Perhaps referring to the string of fractious incidents he has been involved with, including punching a Spanish fan, driving drunk in a Lamborghini and being banned from China, he added: “Learning and growing hasn’t always been easy but knowing I’m not alone has kept me going. I have let my insecurities get the best of me at times, I let my broken relationships dictate the way I acted toward people and the way I treated them. I let bitterness, jealousy and fear run my life.!!!! ... What I’m not gonna do is be ashamed of my mistakes. I wanna be a man that learns from them and grows from them.!!”  He signed off by apologising for any grammatical errors: “I THINK THERES SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT IMPERFECTIONS!!”  With the tour now finished, the statement closes a chapter of his career. His album Purpose spawned a series of colossal hit singles, including What Do You Mean, Love Yourself, and Sorry, which until recently was the most streamed song of all time globally. It was replaced by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee’s Despacito, which Bieber also features on.  Guardian Service","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news.

Global pop sensation Justin Bieber has made the surprising decision to cancel the rest of his Purpose world tour, citing the need to prioritize his mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being. In a heartfelt message to his devoted fans, Bieber revealed that he wants his ""mind, heart, and soul to be sustainable"" and that he needs to take a break from the rigorous demands of touring to achieve this goal.

This announcement has come as a shock to fans who had been eagerly anticipating the remaining dates of the tour, which were set to take place in North America, Europe, and Asia. However, Bieber's decision to prioritize his own well-being is a testament to his commitment to his craft and his desire to maintain a healthy and balanced lifestyle.

According to sources close to the singer, the decision to cancel the tour was not an easy one, and Bieber spent many sleepless nights weighing the pros and cons of continuing the tour versus taking a break. However, in the end, he determined that his mental and emotional health were more important than any professional obligations.

Fans have been supportive of Bieber's decision, with many taking to social media to express their understanding and admiration for the singer's commitment to his well-being. Some have even praised him for setting a positive example for young people everywhere by prioritizing mental health and self-care.

While the cancellation of the Purpose world tour is certainly a disappointment for fans, Bieber's decision to prioritize his own well-being is a reminder that our mental and emotional health should always come first. As the singer himself said, ""I want my mind, heart, and soul to be sustainable,"" and we couldn't agree more."

Since 1999 there have been more than 55 published articles about her being pregnant both in and outside the U.S. It was even reported by the Huffington Post that despite the possibility that the U.S would go into war “Jennifer Aniston Pregnant” was still searched more than “are we at war” on Google.  Jennifer did express in early interviews that she wanted to become a mother one day and from then on the world was waiting. The obsession with her character on Friends—and the fact that Rachel did get pregnant—could be the reason why fans kept a close eye on is she or isn’t she in real life. In fact, the roles Jennifer took on in her career often had a direct impact on when and how her pregnancy rumors evolved.

Reality TV star Kim Kardashian said she is not actively considering a career in politics but she would not rule out the possibility of running for office. The 37-year-old entrepreneur recently met US President Donald Trump to discuss prison reforms after she spent months working with her legal team in a bid to get Alice Johnson parole.  Following her meeting with the president, Alice, who was sentenced to life in prison without parole in 1997 on money laundering and drug conspiracy charges, was released from Aliceville Correctional Facility in Alabama.  When asked if she would ever run for office, Kardashian told CNN, “I guess never say never. But that’s not going to be like, ‘Kim’s running.’ That’s not where I am.”  The “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star added she wants to use her celebrity status for the welfare of people.  “I honestly saw that if I could use my platform just to do something for one person, that it opens the conversation for so much more and for other people to want to do the same thing.  “If more people would just put their personal feelings aside and talk about really important issues that have to be discussed, then so much more can get done,” she said.

According to sources close to the meeting, Kardashian was accompanied by her lawyer and a group of advocates who are working to reduce the number of people serving life sentences without the possibility of parole.

During the meeting, Kardashian reportedly presented Trump with a detailed plan for reforming the country's criminal justice system, including measures to reduce mandatory minimum sentences and provide more resources for rehabilitation programs. Trump, who has long been a vocal proponent of tough-on-crime policies, was said to be receptive to Kardashian's proposals and indicated that he would be open to considering legislation that addresses the issues she raised.

The meeting between Kardashian and Trump was seen as a significant development in the ongoing effort to reform the country's criminal justice system, which has been criticized for being overly punitive and ineffective in reducing crime. Kardashian's advocacy on the issue has been praised by many as a valuable contribution to the debate, and her meeting with Trump is likely to further raise the profile of the issue in the national conversation."

gossipcop-5077951266,1,"The royal wedding is a multi-million dollar affair. Chris Jackson / Getty  The average cost of a wedding for couples in the US and the UK is around $34,000 (£23,700).  Five figures is a huge expense for a one-day affair. That is, unless you're ultra-rich — and especially if you're royalty rich.  Next month, the world will bear witness to the most anticipated royal wedding in years. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to be married on May 19 at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor, and will begin a carriage procession immediately after the ceremony. Their reception will take place later on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding, an expense traditionally taken on by the bride's family.  The case was the same for Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 royal wedding— the only item Middleton paid for was her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress. Their total wedding celebration cost $34 million (£23.7 million).  Markle and Prince Harry's wedding will reportedly cost in excess of $45.8 million (£32 million), according to Bride Book's estimation. That's over 1,000 more than the average wedding.  The venue is the biggest part of a typical wedding budget for couples in the US and the UK, taking up nearly half of the entire wedding cost. Access to St. George's Chapel — and St. George's Great Hall, where the wedding reception will take place — is free of charge for Markle and Prince Harry. Transportation is also free, thanks to the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys.  The greatest cost for the royal couple? Security. Protecting Markle and Prince Harry, plus thousands of guests and onlookers, will run Kensington Palace a whopping $43 million (£30 million), estimates Bride Book. That includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones. The bulk of Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding budget similarly went to security costs.  Otherwise, Markle and Prince Harry's total wedding spend, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to about $2.8 million.  Below, check out Bride Book's breakdown of what the royal wedding will cost.","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news.

Title: Royal Wedding a Multi-Million Dollar Affair

The upcoming royal wedding between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle is expected to be a lavish and extravagant affair, with the estimated cost of the event reaching into the tens of millions of dollars. According to recent reports, the total cost of the wedding is estimated to be around $45 million (£30 million), making it one of the most expensive weddings in recent history.

The high cost of the wedding can be attributed to the many events and receptions that will take place over the course of several days. The wedding will begin with a traditional church service, followed by a reception at St. George's Hall in Windsor Castle. The reception will be held in the State Dining Room, which can accommodate up to 160 guests. The evening will continue with a private dinner and dancing at a nearby estate.

The cost of the wedding is not only due to the number of events, but also the high profile of the guests and the level of security and protocol that must be observed. The wedding will be attended by numerous members of the royal family, as well as celebrities and dignitaries from around the world. The security costs alone are estimated to be around $30 million (£20 million).

While the cost of the wedding may be high, it is a small price to pay for the joy and celebration that the union of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will bring to the nation. The wedding is a symbol of the enduring love and commitment of the couple, and will be remembered for generations to come.

In conclusion, the upcoming royal wedding is shaping up to be a multi-million dollar affair, with the estimated cost of the event reaching into the tens of millions of dollars. The high cost is due to the many events and receptions, as well as the high profile of the guests and the level of security and protocol that must be observed. However, the wedding is a joyous occasion that will be remembered for generations to come."

gossipcop-9362271023,1,"(Video provided by Splash News)  The Weeknd instigated his breakup with Selena Gomez, Gossip Cop can confirm. Gomez’s rekindled friendship with Justin Bieber, however, had nothing to do with the rapper’s decision to end his romance with the singer.  As Gossip Cop reported, Gomez and The Weeknd recently split after nearly a year of dating. The pair weren’t seen together much during the summer, though it was later revealed the singer-actress was laying low due to a kidney transplant. Regardless, they still appeared to be going strong in the early fall. Prior to the announcement of their breakup, the status of their relationship was questioned after it emerged Gomez had rekindled her friendship with Bieber. © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  On Sunday, that speculation swirled as Bieber and Gomez were seen in public and The Weeknd stopped following her friends on social media. That being said, Bieber was allegedly not responsible for the breakup. Rather, it was the challenges of a long-distance relationship, particularly with The Weeknd touring and Gomez’s shooting schedule, that led both the former couple to reconsider their fizzling relationship.  Additionally, contributing to their split, the rapper felt “tied down” in a relationship that had lost its spark. Over time, the pair started talking less frequently on the phone, prompting The Weeknd to end his romance with Gomez, reports TMZ. Despite their breakup, we’re told that the pair are still on good terms and have talked several times since the split.  Predictably, after the rapper ended his relationship with Gomez, Gossip Cop busted the often disproven HollywoodLife for claiming in a made-up report that The Weeknd was “heartbroken” over Gomez reconnecting with Bieber. In the bogus story, the bad blog ridiculously asserted that The Weeknd and Gomez were caught in a “love triangle” with Bieber, but of course, the breakup had nothing to do with and wasn’t caused by the “Love Yourself” singer.

In a shocking turn of events, The Weeknd has reportedly instigated his breakup with Selena Gomez, multiple sources have confirmed to Gossip Cop. According to insiders, the rapper's decision to end his romance with the singer had nothing to do with her rekindled friendship with Justin Bieber, as some may have suspected.

The news of the couple's split has sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry, as The Weeknd and Gomez had been one of the most high-profile celebrity couples in recent years. The two had been dating since 2017 and had been open about their relationship on social media, with The Weeknd even featuring Gomez in his music video for ""Heartless.""

Sources close to the couple have revealed that The Weeknd's decision to end the relationship was not an easy one, and that he had been struggling with the idea of breaking up with Gomez for some time. However, ultimately, he decided that it was best for him to move on and focus on his own personal growth and career.

Gomez, on the other hand, has been focusing on her own personal and professional life, and has been spending more time with her friends and family. While she is said to be heartbroken over the breakup, she is reportedly doing well and is looking forward to moving on and exploring new opportunities.

The news of The Weeknd and Gomez's split has left fans devastated, but many are also praising the couple for their maturity and willingness to move on from the relationship in a healthy and respectful way.

In a statement to Gossip Cop, a source close to The Weeknd said, ""He and Selena had a great run, but ultimately, they decided that it was time to move on. They are both very focused on their own careers and personal growth right now, and they wish each other the best.""

The statement from Gomez's camp was equally as positive, with a source saying, ""Selena is doing well and is grateful for the time she spent with The Weeknd. She is looking forward to exploring new opportunities and focusing on her own personal and professional growth.""

The breakup of The Weeknd and Gomez's relationship may come as a shock to some, but it is clear that both parties are moving on in a healthy and respectful way. As the entertainment industry continues to evolve and change, it will be interesting to see what the future holds for these two talented artists."

The couple has reportedly reached out to a team of paranormal investigators to investigate the claims and determine the cause of the hauntings. The investigators have been documenting their findings and have captured several unexplained phenomena on camera, including a video of a door opening and closing on its own.

The news of the haunted home has left many fans of the couple shocked and intrigued. Some have even speculated that Jackson's ghost may be trying to communicate with the couple or seek their help in resolving some unfinished business.

Whatever the reason, it's clear that Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban have a unique and unexpected challenge on their hands. As they navigate this paranormal situation, one thing is for sure - their dream home will never be the same again."

Photo credit: Mega  “It’s all very shady and ominous. Ellen went to great lengths to keep the news from their close friends to avoid being asked questions,” an insider claimed. “She and Portia were fighting more and more. Eventually, what normally would have been a routine back-and-forth turned nasty .” Photo credit: Mega  Ellen has publicly insisted the couple’s marriage is on solid ground. But sources have exclusively told The ENQUIRER the pair have been spending nights alone, and now they appear to be living completely apart. Photo credit: Mega  Property records show Ellen and Portia — who will be married for ten years on Aug. 16 — maintained two separate residences on the six-acre equestrian estate in exclusive Montecito, Calif., which recently sold for $11 million.

Photo credit: Mega  The talk-show host is a notorious house-flipper — investing in properties before cashing out when the real-estate market heats up. But according to sources, her recent spree is less about the money and more about having separate residences as she and Portia inch closer toward officially separating.

Ellen DeGeneres has fled the marital home she shares with Portia de Rossi, multiple sources have claimed, setting the stage for a blockbuster $400 million divorce.

After a fight to end all fights that climaxed with Ellen ripping off her wedding ring, the popular talk show host and actress has left the couple's shared mansion, leaving her wife of nearly four years behind.

According to sources close to the couple, the fight that led to Ellen's departure was a particularly heated one, with both women raising their voices and engaging in a series of bitter arguments.

The exact cause of the fight is not yet clear, but it is believed to have centered around issues of infidelity and financial disagreements.

Ellen and Portia, who were married in 2010, have been experiencing increasingly strained relations in recent months, with friends and family noticing a significant change in their dynamic.

The couple has not yet commented on the situation, but sources say that Ellen has already retained a high-powered legal team and is preparing to fight for a significant share of their joint assets, which are believed to be worth a staggering $400 million.

The divorce is likely to be one of the most high-profile and expensive celebrity splits in recent memory, and fans of the couple will be watching with bated breath as the drama unfolds.

In the meantime, Ellen has taken to social media to post a series of enigmatic messages, fueling speculation about the state of her marriage and the likelihood of a divorce.

While neither Ellen nor Portia has publicly confirmed the divorce, sources close to the couple say that the writing is on the wall and that a split is all but inevitable.

The news has sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry, with friends and colleagues of the couple expressing their sadness and disbelief at the turn of events.

As the divorce proceedings get underway, all eyes will be on Ellen and Portia to see how they navigate this difficult and potentially messy situation."

Caitlyn Jenner, the TV personality, and a former Olympic gold medal-winning decathlon champion is having a different sense of the quality of expressing her womanhood. She says that the cellulite in her thighs, hips, and tummy is giving her different sense of joy and can’t wait to show it off.  A weird article  The headline “Cellulite Makes Cait Feel So Womanly!” from the National Enquirer/RadarOnline is trending these days. And do you want to know what the article says? You must have some info about this! It said:  Caitlyn Jenner is telling friends she can’t wait to wear a bikini this summer to show off some skin, and her recently acquired cellulite!  That seems really weird, doesn’t it? I mean showing it off in a bikini for what? After all, many people try to hide their cellulite and here Jenner is going to a different path. She is WAITING for the summer just to show it off! Just to remind you, the article also called her a “blabbermouth”. And I don’t think it could be wrong. She blabbering about things that makes no sense. Maybe her excessive talking needed a halt and this quoted name of her may stop her from talking much now. Let’s see what the article had to say other than that. It said:  She has this weird sense of joy when she sees patches of cellulite on her thighs, hips and tummy. The sight of lumpy flesh doesn’t upset her. It makes her feel more feminine!  Maybe Caitlyn is trying to respect her body by respecting what she has. You can’t just disrespect your body for having a lumpy flesh. It is your body after all and if you disrespect it by yourself and obviously you can’t expect respect from others, can you? And who knows, maybe that lumpy dimpled flesh will look really feminine on her. It is creating a buzz in the media as this is not what you hear from a TV personality everyday. After all, every ordinary people might have cellulite in their body. It also said that Jenner’s view: “dimpled feminine flesh as a rite of passage into true womanhood.” and it was also reported that she wouldn’t mind having more cellulite in her body in future. The story features a zoomed-in photo of purported cellulite on Jenner’s leg. Also, after all these years of being a decathlete and going through dieting for years, the 67 year old Jenner might not want to do it anymore. “So let it be!” is what she might have been thinking. Also, the other reason maybe her daughter Kim’s cellulite pictures that surfaced online. This might just be a way to support her daughter.  Rumors or truth  This is not the only time some issues or sites posted a rumor about Caitlyn Jenner. Just last year, a issue of National Enquirer said that Jenner “wants her BIG, clunky-feet reduced to more lady-like proportions.” Again, this just a few days ago, radar online was on about exploring her sexuality online and enjoying a number of secret ‘cyber hookups’. The transgender star, Jenner has had gender reassignment surgery as well as she said she was never interested in men. There are many rumors which may include some truth about Jenner.  Short Bio on Caitlyn Jenner  Caitlyn Jenner is a decathlete turned TV personality. She is known by her previous name “Bruce Jenner”. The Olympic gold medal winner came out as a transgender in April 2015. She is the celebrity from the reality show “Keeping Up with Kardashians” along with her daughters. She has undergone a knee surgery before which she was a college football player for the Graceland Yellowjackets. More Bio…","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news.

Pitt is an honorary member of the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation (EBMRF) that is dedicated to raising money and awareness for the rare skin disorder, epidermolysis bullosa.In January, Pitt introduced singer Chris Cornell during a Rock4EB annual charity to support EBMRF.Further, he revealed in a 2013 Esquire Magazine interview that he self-diagnosed himself with a rare disease – prosopagnosia — also known as face blindness. According to the article, ""Brad Pitt won't remember you. If you've met him, he'll have no idea who you are when he meets you again. Even if you've had what he calls ""a real conversation,"" your face will start fading from his memory as soon as you walk away.""It should be noted that being diagnosed with a condition and being self-diagnosed with a condition can be 2 very different diagnoses.Prosopagnosia refers to the inability to recognize familiar people from their face. They may also be unable to recognize other stimuli, such as objects, cars, or animals.People with prosopagnosia typically learn to use non-face cues including voice, walking style and hairstyle to recognize others. The underlying genetic cause of developmental prosopagnosia is not known but familial reports of this condition are consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.Epidermolysis bullosa (aka 'the worst disease you've never heard of') is a group of devastating, life-threatening genetic skin disorders impacting children that is characterized by skin blisters and erosions all over the body.The most severe form, recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, is characterized by chronic skin blistering, open and painful wounds, joint contractures, esophageal strictures, pseudosyndactyly, corneal abrasions and a shortened life span. Patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa lack functional type VII collagen (C7) owing to mutations in the gene COL7A1 that encodes for C7 and is the main component of anchoring fibrils that attach the dermis to the epidermis.Epidermolysis bullosa patients suffer through intense pain throughout their lives, with no effective treatments available to reduce the severity of their symptoms.","You are a journalist.

Title: Rare Disease Research: Unveiling the Mystery of Prosopagnosia and Epidermolysis Bullosa

Date: May 2, 2017

As the world observes Rare Disease Day today, we shine the spotlight on two lesser-known conditions that have left scientists and medical professionals baffled for years. Prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness, and epidermolysis bullosa, a skin condition characterized by extreme fragility, have been the subject of ongoing research in the rare disease community.

Prosopagnosia, a condition that affects the ability to recognize faces, has long been a topic of interest among researchers. Despite its prevalence, the underlying causes of the disorder remain largely unknown. According to a recent study published in the journal Neuron, researchers have identified a specific genetic mutation that may be responsible for the condition. The study, conducted by a team of scientists from the University of California, Los Angeles, found that individuals with prosopagnosia are more likely to have a mutation in the gene encoding the protein Plexin-A2. This protein plays a crucial role in face perception and recognition.

Meanwhile, epidermolysis bullosa, a group of genetic skin disorders, has been the focus of another recent study. This condition is characterized by the formation of blisters and sores on the skin, mucous membranes, and organs. The study, published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology, revealed that individuals with epidermolysis bullosa have a deficiency in the enzyme keratin 5, which is essential for the maintenance of skin integrity. Researchers believe that this deficiency may lead to the development of the condition.

While these findings are promising, much work remains to be done. The researchers involved in these studies emphasize the need for further investigation to better understand the causes of these conditions and to develop effective treatments.

""These discoveries bring us one step closer to unlocking the mysteries of prosopagnosia and epidermolysis bullosa,"" said Dr. Jane Smith, lead author of the study on prosopagnosia. ""We hope that our findings will pave the way for the development of targeted therapies and improve the quality of life for individuals affected by these conditions.""

In conclusion, Rare Disease Day serves as a reminder of the importance of ongoing research into the mysteries of rare diseases like prosopagnosia and epidermolysis bullosa. With continued support and funding, scientists and medical professionals can work towards finding effective treatments and improving the lives of those affected by these conditions.

USA TODAY President Trump in Trump Tower. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) Corrections & Clarifications: A previous version of the story included a tweet from a parody account claiming to Jill Biden. NEW YORK CITY – President Trump's argument Tuesday that left wing groups were just as violent as the white supremacists who staged a demonstration in Charlottesville set off a firestorm of criticism from members of his own party – and raised questions about his personal views of racial tensions in the country. Just one day after Trump sought to tamp down on controversy by condemning white supremacists for their role in racially motivated clashes in the Virginia city, the president appeared to return to his highly criticized initial response that many sides were to blame for the weekend violence. ""What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, alt-right?"" Trump told reporters in a chaotic impromptu press conference at Trump Tower. ""Do they have any semblance of guilt? What about the fact they came charging with clubs in their hands?"" Trump said he couldn't make a condemnation of hate groups earlier because he didn't ""know all the facts"" about an alleged white nationalist who crashed a car into a crowd of protesters, killing one person and wounded 19 others. CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump told reporters that both sides were to blame for the violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY ""I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct,"" Trump said from Trump Tower in New York, after an event that was intended to be devoted to a new infrastructure executive order. Trump has been especially quick to denounce previous terrorist attacks, including those taking place overseas. Yet he was notably reticent to pinpoint the blame for one on Saturday that involved white supremacists – a point his critics on both sides of the aisle continued to hammer. ""We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. added: ""There is only one side to be on when a white supremacist mob brutalizes and murders in America.” Several lawmakers were dismayed the president appeared to equate white supremacists with their opponents. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., tweeted: ""Blaming 'both sides' for #Charlottesville?! No. Back to relativism when dealing with KKK, Nazi sympathizers, white supremacists? Just no."" Another Republican, Rep. Charlie Dent from Pennsylvania, said Trump ""must stop the moral equivalency! AGAIN."" Over the weekend, Trump faced heavy criticism from both Republicans and Democrats for chiding ""many sides"" for their role in the violence in Charlottesville on Saturday, a statement many regarded as tepid toward racists. A full two days later, on Monday, Trump at the White House directly condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and announced the Justice Department would open up a civil rights investigation into the driver of the car that killed Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer. Yet on Tuesday, amid questions about whether Trump meant the words behind his most recent scripted statement, the president called his initial response ""fine"" and blamed the press for being dishonest in its coverage. ""There was no way of making a correct statement that early,"" he said at one point. ""I had to see the facts. Unlike a lot of reporters – I didn't know (prominent white supremacist) David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts."" For his part, former KKK leader Duke tweeted a thank you to the president after his statement Tuesday – for condemning ""the leftist terrorists"" in Black Lives Matter and Antifa. CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump defends his decision to delay responding to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY Trump also said ""not all of those people"" who attended the demonstration were not racist or neo-Nazi, but only wanted to protest the city's plans to remove the Robert E. Lee statue. That statement also drew catcalls from Republicans. ""If you're showing up to a Klan rally, you're probably a racist or a bigot,"" said Rep. Will Hurd, R-Tex., said on CNN. And Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., tweeted that ""the organizers of events"" that led to the Charlottesville terror attack ""are 100% to blame."" The white supremacists, Rubio tweeted, are ""adherents of an evil ideology which argues certain people are inferior because of race, ethnicity or nation of origin.... When (there's an) entire movement built on anger and hatred towards people different than you, it justifies and ultimately leads to violence against them."" Rubio offered a direct message to Trump: ""Mr. President, you can't allow #WhiteSupremacists to share only part of blame... (they) will see being assigned only 50% of blame as a win. We can not allow this old evil to be resurrected."" More: Trump distances himself from strategist Steve Bannon in wake of Charlottesville violence The president was slated to only discuss infrastructure during his appearances, but took questions from reporters for more than 15 minutes, most of them about Charlottesville. Some aides looked dismayed as he answered more questions.

Here's the news piece based on your sentence:

In a surprise statement issued from Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump has asserted that both protesters and counter protesters are equally to blame for the violence that erupted in Charlottesville, Virginia over the weekend. Speaking to reporters, the President expressed his belief that the clashes were not the result of a single group or ideology, but rather the culmination of a complex web of factors and motivations.

""We have to look at all sides,"" President Trump said, when asked to comment on the violence that left one person dead and numerous others injured. ""I think there's blame on both sides. You had a group on one side that was protesting very quietly, and you had a group on the other side that was protesting very loudly. And then you had a group in the middle that was trying to do what's right, but they were being confronted by both sides.""

The President's statement was met with swift criticism from both sides of the political aisle, with many lawmakers and activists condemning his failure to explicitly denounce white supremacists and other extremist groups that were involved in the violence. Despite this, the President remained steadfast in his position, insisting that all parties involved must take responsibility for their actions.

The situation in Charlottesville is ongoing, with local authorities continuing to investigate the violence and make arrests. The President's statement has only added fuel to an already contentious and emotional debate, with many Americans expressing outrage and dismay at his words. As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the fallout from Charlottesville will be felt for a long time to come."

After deciding that she just can’t let go of this hunk, Mariah reportedly decided to make it happen – an engagement, that is! “Word is Mariah took matters into her own hands,” a source tells OK! magazine, “It was an unusual proposal but it did the trick. She wrote a song about how she wanted Bryan to be her husband and she performed it for him while wearing a sexy, glitzy gown. Then she explained that she’s ready for them to make their relationship official.”  Bryan gave a “hearty yes,” as the insider says, “He couldn’t believe his luck!” It appears Bryan also thinks he and Mariah belong together, and he always wants to be her baby. These two aren’t waiting around for one sweet day to tie the knot. While love takes time, Mariah and Bryan are already busy making wedding plans. “Mariah would love to get married in May at the Grand Wailea Resort in Maui,” the insider told OK!, “where she and Bryan first went public with their romance.” Mariah and Bryan struck up a relationship in late 2016, with Mariah low-key confirming the romance in February 2017 by calling Bryan her “boyfriend.”  Mariah’s “also toying with the idea of a winter wonderland wedding,” the source says. “After all, she is the queen of Christmas!” Could Mariah have the fantasy holiday wedding she’s always wanted, saying “Thank God I found you” to her honey, her all?

Are Wedding Bells in the Future for Mariah Carey?

Multiple sources are reporting that Mariah Carey, the iconic singer known for her powerful voice and timeless hits, has proposed to her boyfriend Bryan Tanaka. According to insiders, the couple has been together for over a year and has been getting more serious with each passing day.

The proposal is said to have taken place during a romantic getaway to the Caribbean, where Tanaka, a dancer and model, reportedly surprised Carey with a stunning diamond ring. ""Bryan knew Mariah was the one from the moment they met, and he wanted to make sure she knew it too,"" a source close to the couple told us.

Now, the two are said to be busy planning their big day, with Carey's team already beginning to scout out potential venues and vendors. While neither Carey nor Tanaka has publicly confirmed the engagement, the signs are certainly pointing towards a wedding in the near future.

This will be the second marriage for Carey, who was previously married to Tommy Mottola and Nick Cannon. The Grammy-winning singer has two children, Moroccan and Monroe, with Cannon.

Fans of Carey are no doubt thrilled about the prospect of the singer walking down the aisle again, and we can't wait to see what this next chapter holds for her and Tanaka. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story!"

Ross, who has been a surrogate for several high-profile celebrity couples, has been praised for her selflessness and generosity in helping others build their families.

While there has been no official confirmation from Parker or her representatives, sources close to the situation say that the actress is ""serious"" about using Ross's services again, and that plans are already underway for the surrogacy.

This exciting news has sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry, and fans of Parker are eagerly awaiting the arrival of her third child. With Ross's proven track record as a surrogate, it's clear that this will be another happy and healthy addition to the actress's family."

Multi-talented actress Nicole Kidman, 50, has been struggling with completing even the simplest of tasks, according to a new report from Globe. The publication's source claims that the Oscar-winning star's flakiness has been causing frustration for her husband Keith Urban, who has been trying to help her manage her busy schedule.

Despite her impressive resume, which includes critically acclaimed films like ""Big Little Lies"" and ""Lion,"" Kidman has reportedly been having trouble completing tasks on time, leading to delays and missed deadlines. The source claims that Urban has been trying to support his wife, but her lack of follow-through has been causing tension in their relationship.

Globe's report suggests that Kidman's flakiness may be due to her overwhelming workload, which includes multiple film and television projects, as well as her commitment to her family. The source states that Urban has been trying to help Kidman prioritize her tasks and manage her time more effectively, but so far, the results have been mixed.

While Kidman has not publicly addressed the report, her representatives have declined to comment on the situation.

Jackman even described the process that goes into the filming of shirtless scenes, which he said involves drinking ten liters of water a day in the months leading up to the scenes, which he said are accomplished through dehydration.  “It’s sort of unbelievable to me, what I did for seventeen years,” Jackman revealed. “The first one, I thought you could get into shape in three weeks. The director pushed all the ‘shirt off’ scenes to the very end.”  “You stop drinking water about 30 hours before you shoot,” Jackman said, explaining the process. “You lose ten pounds of water weight.”  But now that that’s over, Jackman is already enjoying himself.  “Now I’m eating and loving it,” Jackman told Colbert. “Sometimes waking up at two in the morning just to have breakfast cereal, and then go back to bed.”  “With it still in my lap,” he added.

In a highly anticipated interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert tonight, Hugh Jackman put to rest any doubts about his physical transformation after hanging up his adamantium claws as Wolverine. Colbert, never one to shy away from the tough questions, asked Jackman point-blank: now that he’s done playing the iconic X-Men character, will we finally get to see “fat Jackman?”

The audience erupted in laughter at the mere suggestion, but Jackman took the question in stride, assuring Colbert and the viewers that he has no plans to pack on any extra pounds anytime soon. “I’m just happy to be done with the grueling workout regimen and strict diet that came with playing Wolverine,” Jackman joked. “I’m looking forward to enjoying some of the finer things in life, like pizza and beer.”

Despite his lighthearted response, Jackman did hint that he may be exploring some new roles in the near future, possibly in the realm of comedy or drama. “I’m always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as an actor,” he said. “Who knows? Maybe we’ll see a more mature, more rounded Jackman in the years to come.”

(When a progressive verb is working as a noun, it's called a gerund)  But passing that off as something with profound meaning is more than a little goofy.  So ... you're probably wondering what Dr. Phil did wrong.  The short version? Dr. Phil reportedly hit a guy with his car.  According to TMZ, who broke the story, Dr. Phil's car accident happened when the TV star was emerging from a Universal City parking lot.  This was on Friday.  Apparently, Dr. Phil made an impatient attempt to pass a van, and ended up hitting Terrence Bembury -- a 20-something skateboarder and bodybuilder.  Now, getting hit by a car is most people's nightmare.  Getting hit by a car driven by a guy worth an estimated $400 million ... well, if you're okay afterwards, that's the stuff that dreams are made of, right?  There are a couple of versions of how this went down.  One version, the police account (though it looks like no officers were actual witnesses to the collision), says that Terrence Bembury shook hands with Dr. Phil and told him that he was fine.  (Pro-tip: never tell people that you're fine; an impact from even a slow-moving car can cause injuries that you might not notice right away. Sometimes, those injuries can be very serious. Also, never tell the other person ""sorry,"" even if you do feel sorry, as that can be used against you as an admission of fault)  Terrence Bembury now paints a different picture, posting about being injured.  Right now, we don't know whether he was genuinely injured or whether he suddenly realized that he'd have to be out of his mind to not get any cash out of Dr. Phil.  While Terrence might not benefit from the multiple versions of events, as police say that he had earlier been singing the same tune as Dr. Phil and only later changed his story, he says that he's securing a lawyer.  And, honestly, police have reviewed traffic footage and say that Dr. Phil was in the wrong.  If Terrance was actually injured, it sounds like he might have a real case.  We have mixed feelings about this.  On the one hand, if Terrance was injured in the slightest, you'd think that Dr. Phil would be culpable for it.  On the other hand, we've never understood why skateboarders (or bicycles!) are allowed on streets. If we have to humor people who insist upon riding that awful middle-ground between walking and cars, maybe they should have their own lanes, right?  And then there's the possibility -- though we're not accusing him of anything -- that Terrence is taking advantage of this situation for cash.  But ... we think that most people would, right?  Terrence certainly didn't seek out this situation (no one has accused Terrence of being a mastermind schemer who somehow arranged for this to happen or anything), and it's hard to blame him for trying to make the best out of a bad situation.  Dr. Phil might feel differently, though.  But do you know what's the weirdest about this case?  With all of his money, it sounds like Dr. Phil drives himself home from work.","You are a journalist.

(When a progressive verb is working as a noun, it's called a gerund)  But passing that off as something with profound meaning is more than a little goofy.  So ... you're probably wondering what Dr. Phil did wrong.  The short version? Dr. Phil reportedly hit a guy with his car.  According to TMZ, who broke the story, Dr. Phil's car accident happened when the TV star was emerging from a Universal City parking lot.  This was on Friday.  Apparently, Dr. Phil made an impatient attempt to pass a van, and ended up hitting Terrence Bembury -- a 20-something skateboarder and bodybuilder.  Now, getting hit by a car is most people's nightmare.  Getting hit by a car driven by a guy worth an estimated $400 million ... well, if you're okay afterwards, that's the stuff that dreams are made of, right?  There are a couple of versions of how this went down.  One version, the police account (though it looks like no officers were actual witnesses to the collision), says that Terrence Bembury shook hands with Dr. Phil and told him that he was fine.  (Pro-tip: never tell people that you're fine; an impact from even a slow-moving car can cause injuries that you might not notice right away. Sometimes, those injuries can be very serious. Also, never tell the other person ""sorry,"" even if you do feel sorry, as that can be used against you as an admission of fault)  Terrence Bembury now paints a different picture, posting about being injured.  Right now, we don't know whether he was genuinely injured or whether he suddenly realized that he'd have to be out of his mind to not get any cash out of Dr. Phil.  While Terrence might not benefit from the multiple versions of events, as police say that he had earlier been singing the same tune as Dr. Phil and only later changed his story, he says that he's securing a lawyer.  And, honestly, police have reviewed traffic footage and say that Dr. Phil was in the wrong.  If Terrance was actually injured, it sounds like he might have a real case.  We have mixed feelings about this.  On the one hand, if Terrance was injured in the slightest, you'd think that Dr. Phil would be culpable for it.  On the other hand, we've never understood why skateboarders (or bicycles!) are allowed on streets. If we have to humor people who insist upon riding that awful middle-ground between walking and cars, maybe they should have their own lanes, right?  And then there's the possibility -- though we're not accusing him of anything -- that Terrence is taking advantage of this situation for cash.  But ... we think that most people would, right?  Terrence certainly didn't seek out this situation (no one has accused Terrence of being a mastermind schemer who somehow arranged for this to happen or anything), and it's hard to blame him for trying to make the best out of a bad situation.  Dr. Phil might feel differently, though.  But do you know what's the weirdest about this case?  With all of his money, it sounds like Dr. Phil drives himself home from work."

The site also points out that Halle has only been on the NYC set for one day so far, which isn’t much time to strike up a romance.  Meanwhile, Berry recently teased the movie’s opening date on Instagram. She posted a note scrawled on paper from The Continental in NYC. The message said, “See you in a year, Mr. Wick,” and included the caption, “It's a date. 5.17.19.”  It's a date. 5.17.19 A post shared by Halle Berry (@halleberry) on May 21, 2018 at 8:59am PDT  In the movie, John Wick (Reeves) is on the run with a $14-million bounty on his head.

The two stars were photographed looking pretty chummy on the set of their new film ""John Wick: Chapter 3,"" sparking rumors they were seeing each other.

The rumor mill is buzzing with news of a possible romance between Hollywood heavyweights Halle Berry and Keanu Reeves. Sources on the set of their upcoming film ""John Wick: Chapter 3"" have spotted the two getting cozy and exchanging sweet nothings.

Berry, 53, and Reeves, 54, have been working together on the action-packed thriller for the past few months, and their on-screen chemistry has seemingly translated off-screen as well.

Eyewitnesses claim that the two have been spotted holding hands, laughing and joking together, and even sharing sweet kisses on set. While neither star has confirmed the rumors, their actions speak louder than words.

The possibility of a romance between Berry and Reeves is not entirely surprising, given their long history of successful collaborations. They have both had successful careers in Hollywood for decades, with Berry winning an Academy Award for her role in ""Monster's Ball"" and Reeves starring in blockbusters like ""The Matrix"" and ""John Wick.""

If the rumors are true, this would be the first high-profile romance for both stars since their respective divorces. Berry was previously married to Olivier Martinez and Gabriel Aubry, while Reeves has been linked to several celebrities, including Jennifer Syme and Sandra Bullock.

Their representatives have yet to comment on the rumors, but fans are eagerly awaiting any official confirmation of a romance between these two Hollywood legends. Only time will tell if the rumors are true, but for now, the speculation is enough to keep fans on the edge of their seats."

Gossip Cop can exclusively bust this claim. We’re told it “never happened.”  © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  According to Life & Style, Maguire recently spotted the La La Land star at the swanky Hollywood hotel. A so-called “source” tells the magazine, “He was checking her out a lot, hoping she’d notice him.” The outlet’s dubious insider goes on to say that the actor eventually approached her, and began “showering her with cheesy compliments, telling her how all of Hollywood was in love with her.”  The magazine’s “source” then purports that Stone “didn’t seem interested in him,” but she “finally gave him her number and suggested meeting up for coffee, then ran off.” The supposed insider adds, “It was pretty obvious she was blowing him off.”  Gossip Cop, however, checked in with a reliable source close to the actor, who exclusively tells us the tabloid’s entire account of events is made-up and simply “never happened.” Unfortunately, we’re not surprised that Life & Style published this completely fictitious story.

gossipcop-7283158323,1,"The pair became close friends on set when they filmed Netflix show Maniac and Jen is said to be wondering whether they have been dating while she and Justin were still a couple.  ‘Justin and Emma did a movie together last year, so Jen is of course now wondering whether they hooked up back then - when Justin and Jen were still married,’ spills the source.  ‘It’s certainly not the first time Jen’s seen her husband fall for another actress on set, so of course she’s wary. It happened with Brad and Angelina – so Jen can’t help but think history is repeating itself,’ the insider says.  To add insult to injury, Jen has been close to Emma for a while and with these recent revelations, Jen feels her pal has been disloyal.  ‘She and Emma have been friends – the fact that she’s now hanging with Jen’s ex-husband is a complete betrayal. Emma has obviously chosen to side with Justin after the whole split, which is very telling to Jen considering that she’s been friends with Emma.  ‘She just wants to know when their hook-ups started – they looked so cosy and happy on their date, like this definitely wasn’t their first night out,’ the source continues.  ‘Jen just feels completely humiliated, like she’s being played for a fool – and she doesn’t like it one little bit.’  Jen and Justin called it quits in February this year and he has stayed friends with Emma since.  Justin even posted the two of them hanging out onto his Instagram, but he was quick to declare they were ‘just friends’.  But just a month after announcing his split from Jen, Justin was seen at the Louis Vuitton show beside Emma.  He has also been linked to various other women including actress Aubrey Plaza and artist Petra Collins, while Emma is said to be dating writer Dave McCarthy since last year.  In the meantime, Jen has been rumoured to be back together again with her ex-husband Brad Pitt who recently finalised his divorce from Angelina Jolie.  Jen is also alleged to be pregnant with Brad’s child and was spotted getting off a private plane a few weeks back, hiding what seemed to be a baby bump.  But the news comes amid controversy that Brad Pitt is secretly dating beautiful architect Neri Oxman, leaving Jen to possibly consider raising their baby alone.  Jen and Justin have remained estranged since the split and sources tell New Idea the pair had an explosive showdown a few weeks ago as he returned to their Bel Air mansion to collect the rest of his belongings.  Now with the recent release of the pictures of Justin’s cosy date with Emma, the relationship with Jen is certain to become even more frosty.

The 'sentence' is: ",The pair became close friends on set when they filmed Netflix show Maniac and Jen is said to be wondering whether they have been dating while she and Justin were still a couple.,"Jen and Brad's friendship has been a hot topic of conversation in recent weeks, with sources close to the pair revealing that they have been spending more and more time together on and off set. According to insiders, the two have been getting on extremely well and have been supporting each other through the challenges of filming the hit Netflix show Maniac.

However, things have reportedly taken a more romantic turn in recent days, with Jen said to be wondering whether she and Brad have been dating while she and her ex-husband Justin Theroux were still a couple. While neither party has confirmed anything, sources close to the pair have revealed that they have been spending more and more time together in private, fueling speculation that a romance may be blossoming.

Despite their busy schedules, Jen and Brad have reportedly been making time for each other, with the pair often seen leaving the set together after long days of filming. And while they have both been careful not to publicly confirm their relationship, their body language and behavior towards each other have been telling a different story.

As the rumors continue to swirl, fans of the pair are eagerly awaiting any official confirmation of their relationship status. But for now, all we can do is speculate and watch this space for any further developments."

Right before that HOH competition, he had known that that was the anniversary of my dad’s passing, so it was a very emotional day for me. And instead of being a kind and caring human being — because this is just a game — he decided to kick me while I was down.”  “I think that that’s disgusting and I don’t stand by it,” Jessica declared in no uncertain terms about Josh’s controversial bullying. “And I just don’t like him as a person after that.” Jessica was evicted with a vote of 7 to 1, with her live-in boyfriend Cody Nickson being the only person to cast a vote for Raven Walton; Elena Davies received zero votes to evict. Read our Episode 21 recap here.  Does Jessica acknowledge that she threw away her chance at the $500,000 prize for a relationship with Cody? “It wasn’t that I gave up my game for Cody. We just thought alike. And because we thought so much alike, he was my partner in this game.” Jessica then admitted, “Of course I do,” when Julie asked if she loved Cody.  Still emotional, Jessica confessed, “It took half the season of just being attacked, lied to and back-stabbed for me to just give up. I put a lot of heart into certain relationships and friendships that I had with people in that house, and they lied to me several times and stabbed me in the back and let me down every chance that they had. So I just gave up.”  Also in her “Big Brother” exit interview Jessica learned that Josh’s real target was Elena, but that he only started campaigning against Jessica after the verbal attacks during the impromptu spelling bee. “I am so happy I don’t have to hear [Josh’s] voice anymore,” she responded. “Oh my God!

She also claimed that Kayleigh Morris outed her on social media following the huge fight during Vendettas, in which other women in the house threw Kaleigh’s luggage over the balcony. While Natalie claims she was not part of the “mean girls” moment, as the show phrased it, Kaleigh didn’t believe her, later calling her a “lesbian” on social media.  “She did it in a really malicious way, and that’s what really hurt me. The way she did it. She was saying, ‘She doesn’t even like d—k, she likes p—sy. She’s a lesbian.’ I’m not a lesbian, I’m pansexual,” Natalie, 28, told Us Weekly on the “Watch With Us” podcast. “She outed me in a really aggressive way and kept going. It was really homophobic in a way. To me, that’s getting gay shamed. Then there was a whole bunch of people that started gay-shaming me, calling me a ‘dyke,’ going on my social media and attacking me for being gay.”  Natalie wasn’t ready to come out – and didn’t plan on doing so on the show. In fact, she hadn’t told her family at the time of Kayleigh’s comments. Since, she has called everyone and was forced to open up about everything.  “It’s been a 28-year battle for me,” Natalie said. “I wanted to set a standard because you can’t do that. There are so many teenagers and kids that commit suicide every year because they get outed inappropriately. She took something that was mine and made it her own, and she did it really in a nasty way. Outing someone is not right and I want to set that standard … I wanted to come out in the right way, I wanted to turn it into something positive so that viewers that are going through the same thing that I’ve gone through don’t have to go through it for 28 years.”  Natalie also revealed she is in an exclusive relationship with a woman, who she describes as her “biggest supporter.” After Vendettas, Natalie and Johnny Bananas dated casually while both seeing other people. Ultimately, it just didn’t work.

Since then, the story has developed continuously, with a large number of women coming forward to say they were sexually harassed or assaulted by Weinstein - allegations he has denied. Here is a summary of the events so far: 5 October 2017 The New York Times publishes a story detailing decades of allegations of sexual harassment against Harvey Weinstein. Actresses Rose McGowan and Ashley Judd are among the women who come forward. Among the accusations are that he forced women to massage him and watch him naked. He also promised to help advance their careers in return for sexual favours. Weinstein issues an apology acknowledging he ""has caused a lot of pain"" - but disputes allegations he harassed female employees over nearly three decades. Weinstein's lawyer tells The Hollywood Reporter his client is preparing to sue the New York Times. Weinstein says he is taking a ""leave of absence"" from The Weinstein Company and is working with a therapist. 6 October 2017 Brie Larson and Lena Dunham are among those to react to the allegations in the article, praising the bravery of those who have come forward. The Weinstein Company says it takes the allegations ""extremely seriously"" and is launching an inquiry. 7 October 2017 Weinstein's lawyer Lisa Bloom announces her resignation, saying she understands that ""Mr Weinstein and his board are moving toward an agreement"". 8 October 2017 It is announced that Harvey Weinstein has been sacked by the board of his company, with immediate effect. They say the decision was made ""in light of new information about misconduct"". 9 October 2017 10 October 2017 Allegations from 13 more women are published in the New Yorker magazine, including three accusations of rape, which Weinstein strongly denies. Actress Asia Argento and a former aspiring actress named Lucia Stoller say Weinstein forced himself on them sexually. A third woman withholds her name from the article, the result of a 10-month investigation by the magazine. Argento says the incident happened in 1997 in the south of France while Stoller, who now goes under the name Evans, says she was forced into a sexual act by the producer after going for a casting meeting in 2004. Mira Sorvino, who starred in several of Weinstein's films, told the New Yorker that Weinstein sexually harassed her and tried to pressure her into a physical relationship. Weinstein's spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister tells the publication: ""Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr Weinstein."" Hollywood A-listers Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie say they were harassed by Weinstein. Paltrow says she was propositioned as a 22-year-old, while Jolie refers to a ""bad experience"" in her youth. Other figures to speak out against Weinstein include Barack Obama, Benedict Cumberbatch and Leonardo DiCaprio. Weinstein's wife Georgina Chapman announces she is leaving him and that her priority is her young children. 11 October 2017 Bafta says it is suspending Weinstein's membership, with immediate effect. A number of senior Labour MPs call for Weinstein's honorary CBE to be taken away. Prime Minister Theresa May says a decision about the honour would not lie with Downing Street. Cara Delevingne also says Weinstein made advances towards her. A statement from the Cannes Film Festival says organisers are ""dismayed"" to learn of the allegations about Weinstein. 12 October 2017 Overnight, police are called following a ""family dispute"" at the home of Weinstein's daughter. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) confirms they were called to reports of a ""disturbance"" at the house but say no crime was committed. Weinstein was not there when officers arrived. Police in New York tell the BBC they are looking to speak to an individual regarding an allegation against Weinstein dating from 2004. The NYPD does not provide further details. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the organisation behind the Oscars, says it will meet on Saturday to discuss any course of action to be taken concerning Weinstein. It describes the allegations against Weinstein as ""repugnant"" and ""abhorrent"". Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane addresses a joke he made about Weinstein's sexual conduct at the 2013 Oscar nominations, saying he decided to speak out after a co-star had been harassed by the producer. Police in the US and UK say they are investigating specific allegations from 2004 and the 1980s. No charges have been brought. Rose McGowan says on Twitter that Weinstein raped her. Weinstein has ""unequivocally denied"" any allegations of non-consensual sex in a statement released through his publicist. Amazon Studio chief Roy Price is put on a ""leave of absence"". McGowan has accused Price of having ignored her when she previously made an allegation about Weinstein. And Price has himself been accused of sexually harassing a female producer, it emerges. In addition, Amazon says it is reviewing projects it has with The Weinstein Company. 13 October 2017 Weinstein's former office assistant Lisa Rose says the film mogul tried to invite her to another room, mentioning a massage. The Late, Late Show presenter James Corden makes jokes about Weinstein's alleged sexual assaults at a charity gala in Los Angeles. He later apologises on Twitter, saying he ""was not trying to make light of Harvey's inexcusable behaviour, but to shame him, the abuser, not his victims"". 14 October 2017 The organisation behind the Oscars votes to expel Weinstein following the allegations. In a statement, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences says: ""What's at issue here is a deeply troubling problem that has no place in our society."" Actress Alice Evans tells Radio 5 Live that Weinstein made lewd comments towards her. Kate Winslet reveals she deliberately did not thank Weinstein when she won her Oscar for The Reader in 2009.

Argento says the incident happened in 1997 in the south of France while Stoller, who now goes under the name Evans, says she was forced into a sexual act by the producer after going for a casting meeting in 2004. Mira Sorvino, who starred in several of Weinstein's films, told the New Yorker that Weinstein sexually harassed her and tried to pressure her into a physical relationship. Weinstein's spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister tells the publication: ""Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr Weinstein."" Hollywood A-listers Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie say they were harassed by Weinstein. Paltrow says she was propositioned as a 22-year-old, while Jolie refers to a ""bad experience"" in her youth. Other figures to speak out against Weinstein include Barack Obama, Benedict Cumberbatch and Leonardo DiCaprio. Weinstein's wife Georgina Chapman announces she is leaving him and that her priority is her young children. 11 October 2017 Bafta says it is suspending Weinstein's membership, with immediate effect. A number of senior Labour MPs call for Weinstein's honorary CBE to be taken away. Prime Minister Theresa May says a decision about the honour would not lie with Downing Street. Cara Delevingne also says Weinstein made advances towards her. A statement from the Cannes Film Festival says organisers are ""dismayed"" to learn of the allegations about Weinstein. 12 October 2017 Overnight, police are called following a ""family dispute"" at the home of Weinstein's daughter. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) confirms they were called to reports of a ""disturbance"" at the house but say no crime was committed. Weinstein was not there when officers arrived. Police in New York tell the BBC they are looking to speak to an individual regarding an allegation against Weinstein dating from 2004. The NYPD does not provide further details. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the organisation behind the Oscars, says it will meet on Saturday to discuss any course of action to be taken concerning Weinstein. It describes the allegations against Weinstein as ""repugnant"" and ""abhorrent"". Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane addresses a joke he made about Weinstein's sexual conduct at the 2013 Oscar nominations, saying he decided to speak out after a co-star had been harassed by the producer. Police in the US and UK say they are investigating specific allegations from 2004 and the 1980s. No charges have been brought. Rose McGowan says on Twitter that Weinstein raped her. Weinstein has ""unequivocally denied"" any allegations of non-consensual sex in a statement released through his publicist. Amazon Studio chief Roy Price is put on a ""leave of absence"". McGowan has accused Price of having ignored her when she previously made an allegation about Weinstein. And Price has himself been accused of sexually harassing a female producer, it emerges. In addition, Amazon says it is reviewing projects it has with The Weinstein Company. 13 October 2017 Weinstein's former office assistant Lisa Rose says the film mogul tried to invite her to another room, mentioning a massage. The Late, Late Show presenter James Corden makes jokes about Weinstein's alleged sexual assaults at a charity gala in Los Angeles. He later apologises on Twitter, saying he ""was not trying to make light of Harvey's inexcusable behaviour, but to shame him, the abuser, not his victims"". 14 October 2017 The organisation behind the Oscars votes to expel Weinstein following the allegations. In a statement, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences says: ""What's at issue here is a deeply troubling problem that has no place in our society."" Actress Alice Evans tells Radio 5 Live that Weinstein made lewd comments towards her. Kate Winslet reveals she deliberately did not thank Weinstein when she won her Oscar for The Reader in 2009. ""I remember being told, 'Make sure you thank Harvey if you win',"" the actress tells the Los Angeles Times. ""And I"

Title: Mariah Carey Pivots to T-Shirt Sales for 2018, Because Why Not?

Subtitle: Pop Diva's Latest Venture Has Fans Asking, ""Why Not?""

Mariah Carey, the pop diva who stole the show at the Golden Globes and cancelled brunch forever with a single tweet, has announced her latest venture for 2018: selling T-shirts. Yes, you read that right! The singer, who has been making headlines left and right with her meme-inducing moments, has decided to pivot to T-shirt sales, leaving fans asking, ""Why not?""

According to sources close to the singer, Carey has been designing a line of T-shirts that feature her iconic lyrics and catchphrases. The T-shirts will be available for purchase on her official website and at select retailers.

Fans are already going wild for the news, with many taking to social media to express their excitement. ""OMG, I can't believe Mariah Carey is selling T-shirts now! This is everything!"" wrote one fan on Twitter. ""I need to get my hands on one of these T-shirts ASAP!""

Carey's foray into T-shirt sales comes on the heels of her meme-inducing moment at her New Year's Eve performance, where she famously flubbed the lyrics to her hit song ""Emotions."" The performance went viral and sparked a wave of memes, with many fans creating their own versions of the ""Mariah Carey fail"" meme.

Despite the meme-induced backlash, Carey has continued to make headlines and keep her fans entertained. Her latest venture into T-shirt sales is just the latest example of her unwavering commitment to her craft and her fans.

So, why T-shirts? According to sources close to the singer, Carey has always been a fan of T-shirts and has been wearing them on and off stage for years. ""Mariah has always been a T-shirt kind of girl,"" said a source. ""She loves the comfort and the versatility of T-shirts, and she thinks they're the perfect way to connect with her fans.""

And it's not just about the T-shirts themselves. Carey has also been working on a new line of accessories, including hats and scarves, to complete the look. ""Mariah wants her fans to be able to rock her style from head to toe,"" said the source.

Fans can expect to see the full line of T-shirts and accessories on Carey's official website and at select retailers in the coming weeks. In the meantime, they can get a sneak peek of the collection on Carey's social media accounts, where she has been teasing the line with behind-the-scenes photos and videos.

So, there you have it, folks. Mariah Carey is selling T-shirts now, because why not? The pop diva continues to defy expectations and entertain her fans, one T-shirt at a time."

It's now the 10th leading cause of death in the country, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Studies have shown that the risk of suicide declines sharply when people call the national suicide hotline: 1-800-273-TALK  There is also a crisis text line.  The lines are staffed by a mix of paid professionals and unpaid volunteers trained in crisis and suicide intervention. The confidential environment, the 24-hour accessibility, a caller's ability to hang up at any time and the person-centered care have helped its success, advocates say.","You are a journalist.

And makes me very sad for him to have -- to have succumbed to that.""  Asking for help  The suicide rate in the United States has seen sharp increases in recent years. It's now the 10th leading cause of death in the country, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Studies have shown that the risk of suicide declines sharply when people call the national suicide hotline: 1-800-273-TALK  There is also a crisis text line.  The lines are staffed by a mix of paid professionals and unpaid volunteers trained in crisis and suicide intervention. The confidential environment, the 24-hour accessibility, a caller's ability to hang up at any time and the person-centered care have helped its success, advocates say."
gossipcop-3308884181,1,"Beyoncé Rumored To Be Asking For Silent Delivery  As the countdown to Blueprint 1 and Blueprint 2’s arrival continues, the stories about Bey’s birth plans abound. First, we heard she planned to give birth at home, then they said her security has been running weekly drills to practice their approach to Cedars-Sinai and now there’s a report that Bey wants silence in the delivery room.  According to Naughty Gossip reports:  “Beyoncé likes peace and calm around her. She has zero time for drama and gossip. She likes her inner circle to be soft spoken if they have to talk at all. And you can expect the same will be true when she gives birth to the twins,” sources tell Straight Shuter. “You can only get into her private life if you are invited. She is very guarded and protects her privacy at all cost. She likes to be surrounded with peaceful colors and soft sounds. This will be of utmost importance for her when giving birth.”  This story is almost like opening up a fortune cookie or visiting your average storefront psychic. EVERYBODY knows Beyoncé is private. THAT doesn’t take an exclusive source to figure out.  Silent birth is a real thing though – something that Scientologists practice and Katie Holmes even did when she gave birth to Suri, but as much as Bey loves music we don’t really see her doing a silent birth.  Speaking of Bey’s love of music… Hit the flip for some recently posted pics of her from a Michael Jackson/Prince party.  GettyImages/Instagram","You are a journalist.

Yes, you heard that right, Beyoncé wants a delivery without any noise!

According to a close source, Beyoncé is not only planning a silent delivery, but she also wants her hospital room to be soundproofed so that no one can hear her babies cry.

Beyoncé, who has always been a private person, is determined to keep her birth experience under wraps. She has reportedly instructed her staff to only allow a select few to be present during the delivery, and she has also requested that the hospital staff to be silent during the entire process.

While this may seem like an extreme request, it's not entirely surprising given Beyoncé's history of keeping her personal life private. After all, this is the same woman who refused to confirm her pregnancy until she was well into her second trimester.

The question is, will Beyoncé be able to pull off a silent delivery? Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure: Beyoncé is determined to keep her birth experience under wraps."

Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner’s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  ‘She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,’ said the source. ‘But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making ‘I am Cait’ shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner’s ‘unpredictable’ behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: ‘[The book] is definitely something that she’s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  ‘But the family were like, it’s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  ‘They were worried because she’s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.’  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J.

It is being reported by DailyMail.com that Caitlyn Jenner, 67, is planning to take it all off for a nude photo shoot. The decision comes just months after the reality TV star underwent gender reassignment surgery in January, as revealed in her new memoir, 'The Secrets of My Life.'

According to sources close to the former Olympic athlete, Jenner is looking to embrace her new identity by baring all for the upcoming photo shoot. This will be the first time that Jenner will have posed nude in public, and it is expected to generate significant attention and controversy.

Jenner's decision to go nude comes as no surprise, given her history of pushing boundaries and challenging societal norms. In her memoir, she opens up about her struggles with gender identity and her decision to transition from male to female.

The upcoming photo shoot is expected to be a powerful statement of self-acceptance and confidence, and it will undoubtedly spark a national conversation about gender, identity, and the human body.

While some may criticize Jenner's decision as being too provocative or attention-seeking, it is important to remember that her journey is one of self-discovery and empowerment. By embracing her true identity, Jenner is inspiring countless others to do the same.

The photo shoot is expected to take place in the coming weeks, and DailyMail.com will be there to capture every moment. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story."
gossipcop-926125,0,"Kate Gosselin is ready to get back into the dating scene.  It’s been a little more than eight years since the mother of eight’s divorce from Jon Gosselin was finalized in December 2009, and now, the Kate Plus 8 star is ready to give love another chance.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  PEOPLE can exclusively reveal that Gosselin, 43, will star in new TLC series Kate Plus Date, which will document the reality star on her dating journey.  “I’m nervous, I’m excited, and I’m forcing myself to do this,” Gosselin, who was married to ex-husband Jon for 10 years, tells PEOPLE about the upcoming docuseries.  In fall 2019, her two eldest children — twins Mady and Cara, both 17 — will go off to college, leaving Gosselin at home with 13-year-old sextuplets Aaden, Joel, Alexis, Hannah and Leah. (Collin is enrolled in a program away from home to help him reach his full potential.)  “As we’re talking about Mady and Cara going off to college which is becoming more and more of a reality, it’s gonna happen, it almost became like a worry for them, too, like ‘Mommy, you’re gonna be all alone soon,’ ” shares Gosselin. “But it was very apparent, now that they’re older and talking about dating and how they’re all gonna get married someday … it became apparent: they want someone for me. They want me to have somebody in my life.”  Larsen & Talbert  In a moment of reflection, Gosselin says she “started picturing myself sitting in a rocking chair, knitting, and words like ‘old maid’ and ‘spinster’ started to come to mind, and I realized that no, I don’t want that to be my fate.”  “I stopped focusing on myself — I used to be a runner, and all of these things sort of fell by the wayside, and I sort of forgot about the dating thing,” she says. “It’s never really fit into my life.”  Though Gosselin admits her life is “very complicated,” she won’t allow that to hold her back from the possibility of finding happily ever after.  “If I’m going to date someone, I can’t just go out on a date — it’s creepy to me to think of just going out somewhere with some stranger, and so I actually feel like doing it like this is the best and safest way for me to go on a date — a camera crew will be there! I’ll be safe!” she says. “And the person will have been vetted by a matchmaker.”  For Gosselin, having her dating life documented for cameras is safer — and far less intimidating — than going online.  “I won’t be just doing some scary online thing,” she says. “I mean, online dating, seriously — I put my profile in there and people will know who it is within 90 seconds. No, this is probably the safest way for me to date, let’s be honest.”  WATCH: Story Behind the Story: A Lesson Kate Gosselin Had to Learn the Hard Way  As for what Gosselin is looking for in a match, she’s “not sure,” but remains “open: whoever they match me with, I’m game.”  “I do want someone with a set career, who is confident. A grown-up with their own life, their own agenda, who knows who they are. If someone travels for work, that would be great, because I’m used to being on my own and being self-sufficient,” she shares.  She doesn’t want anyone she has “to care of,” but rather desires a man who is “self-sufficient, who won’t suffocate me.”  The TLC personality asserts that the lucky guy she could one day introduce to her kids “won’t be my kids’ dad,” but rather “would love my kids to have a mutual friendship and respect with this guy and for him to be someone they can ask for advice. It would be great for my kids to have someone they can feel like is a real friend.”  Most importantly, Gosselin says her perfect match “must love dogs.”  “That is such a deal-breaker,” says Gosselin, who frequently shares photos of her furry family members on social media. “People disappoint you, but your dogs never will.”  Kate Plus Date is coming to TLC this fall.","You are a journalist.

It’s been a little more than eight years since the mother of eight’s divorce from Jon Gosselin was finalized in December 2009, and now, the Kate Plus 8 star is ready to give love another chance.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  PEOPLE can exclusively reveal that Gosselin, 43, will star in new TLC series Kate Plus Date, which will document the reality star on her dating journey.  “I’m nervous, I’m excited, and I’m forcing myself to do this,” Gosselin, who was married to ex-husband Jon for 10 years, tells PEOPLE about the upcoming docuseries.  In fall 2019, her two eldest children — twins Mady and Cara, both 17 — will go off to college, leaving Gosselin at home with 13-year-old sextuplets Aaden, Joel, Alexis, Hannah and Leah. (Collin is enrolled in a program away from home to help him reach his full potential.)  “As we’re talking about Mady and Cara going off to college which is becoming more and more of a reality, it’s gonna happen, it almost became like a worry for them, too, like ‘Mommy, you’re gonna be all alone soon,’ ” shares Gosselin. “But it was very apparent, now that they’re older and talking about dating and how they’re all gonna get married someday … it became apparent: they want someone for me. They want me to have somebody in my life.”  Larsen & Talbert  In a moment of reflection, Gosselin says she “started picturing myself sitting in a rocking chair, knitting, and words like ‘old maid’ and ‘spinster’ started to come to mind, and I realized that no, I don’t want that to be my fate.”  “I stopped focusing on myself — I used to be a runner, and all of these things sort of fell by the wayside, and I sort of forgot about the dating thing,” she says. “It’s never really fit into my life.”  Though Gosselin admits her life is “very complicated,” she won’t allow that to hold her back from the possibility of finding happily ever after.  “If I’m going to date someone, I can’t just go out on a date — it’s creepy to me to think of just going out somewhere with some stranger, and so I actually feel like doing it like this is the best and safest way for me to go on a date — a camera crew will be there! I’ll be safe!” she says. “And the person will have been vetted by a matchmaker.”  For Gosselin, having her dating life documented for cameras is safer — and far less intimidating — than going online.  “I won’t be just doing some scary online thing,” she says. “I mean, online dating, seriously — I put my profile in there and people will know who it is within 90 seconds. No, this is probably the safest way for me to date, let’s be honest.”  WATCH: Story Behind the Story: A Lesson Kate Gosselin Had to Learn the Hard Way  As for what Gosselin is looking for in a match, she’s “not sure,” but remains “open: whoever they match me with, I’m game.”  “I do want someone with a set career, who is confident. A grown-up with their own life, their own agenda, who knows who they are. If someone travels for work, that would be great, because I’m used to being on my own and being self-sufficient,” she shares.  She doesn’t want anyone she has “to care of,” but rather desires a man who is “self-sufficient, who won’t suffocate me.”  The TLC personality asserts that the lucky guy she could one day introduce to her kids “won’t be my kids’ dad,” but rather “would love my kids to have a mutual friendship and respect with this guy and for him to be someone they can ask for advice. It would be great for my kids to have someone they can feel like is a real friend.”  Most importantly, Gosselin says her perfect match “must love dogs.”  “That is such a deal-breaker,” says Gosselin, who frequently shares photos of her furry family members on social media. “People disappoint you, but your dogs never will.”  Kate Plus Date is coming to TLC this fall."
gossipcop-6742180407,1,"It was a humid 84 degrees in Bridgehampton on Saturday, but that didn’t stop a crowd of people from descending upon Topping Rose House for Jill Zarin’s annual luncheon. The former Real Housewife of New York, ran around the grounds in an A-line Carolina Herrera dress, posing on the step-and-repeat, taking photos with fans, and catching up with old friends. Trying to track her down for an interview turned into a scavenger hunt.  Scattered around the lawn were tables for vendors selling everything from wine to sex toys. There was a station for guests to get a vitamin infusion, with seats in the direct line of the sun transforming the spot into an inescapable sauna-I.V. drip hybrid. Housewives from across the country flew into town for the occasion (Vicki Gunvalson of Orange County and LeeAnne Locken of Dallas), which also served as a benefit for Thyroid Cancer Research in honor of Zarin’s late husband, Bobby, who died of the disease in January.  Upon first try to flag Zarin down for a couple of questions, she sent over her daughter, Ally Shapiro, in her stead. Shapiro reflected on last year’s luncheon, when her stepfather was still struggling with cancer, but encouraged her and her mother to party on.  “He loved drinking and partying. This was the highlight of his year,” she said. “It was this time last year that we were told he wasn’t gonna make it another week, and he pushed us and he said, ‘Go to the party. Maybe I won’t be here when you come back, but go.’”  Shapiro, who now lives in London while she works on her master’s degree, admits that she can’t watch old episodes of Real Housewives, which showed her as 14-year-old struggling to get close to her stepfather. “You want to think that it’s like a home movie, but it’s not. That’s not what our relationship was like,” she said, adding that the reruns play constantly in the U.K. “I’m walking down the street and someone’s like, ‘Oh my God, I just saw you trying on a prom dress!’”  She also said that her mother is dabbling with dating, specifically with a man she plays tennis with. “It’s fun, and I live in London so it’s good for her to have a distraction.”  Dina Lohan, dressed in a metallic green blazer and shorts set and a pair of oversized aviators, arrived fashionably late to the affair, but was immediately greeted by hoards of people trying to chat her up or get a photo. Eventually secured in the same spot for more than a few seconds, she was willing to talk about her daughter Lindsay’s upcoming project for MTV, a Vanderpump Rules–inspired reality show that follows Lindsay and the employees of her new Lohan Beach Club. Bunim/Murray Productions is producing the series, the same company that produced Lohan’s E! reality show Living Lohan a decade ago.  “These kids were like, babies, and now they’re running the show,” she said of the crew. “They lived in my house! And now they’re all corporate. . . . We’re home. It’s cyclical, you know.”  Lohan also revealed that the upcoming series is a bit of a family affair with Lindsay’s younger sister, 24-year-old Ali, providing the theme song.  A friend of Lohan’s interjected, asking if Ali, like her older sister over a decade ago, had moved out to L.A. for work.  “She’s in New York with me,” the matriarch answered. “I keep them close! I’m not going to lose someone to L.A., no. Not again!”  Finally, the woman of the hour managed to stop and take a breath. While Zarin may no longer be a Bravo housewife, she still knows how to schmooze like one. She’s been keeping up with the latest season of the show here and there, and even received a good-luck message from Luann de Lesseps, who checked into rehab earlier in the month, wishing her good luck on the event. Having brought me up to speed, Zarin closed our conversation with a plug for her new line of “pet-proof, gorgeous, and inexpensive” rugs, aptly titled Jill Zarin Rugs.

gossipcop-7384566778,1,"Kylie Jenner may have skipped out on the 2017 Kardashian Christmas card, but she did attend mom Kris Jenner’s annual Christmas Eve party in Los Angeles.  The 20-year-old cosmetics guru — who is expecting her first child, a baby girl, with boyfriend Travis Scott — did not appear in any photos from the bash shared to social media by KarJenner family members. But a source tells PEOPLE she was there celebrating away from the cameras.  “Kylie looked great but didn’t really draw any attention to her baby bump,” the source says. “She still acts like she wants to keep her pregnancy private.”  Meanwhile, her sister Khloé Kardashian, — who earlier this week confirmed that she and boyfriend Tristan Thompson are expecting their first child together — accentuated her own baby bump in a skin-tight, sparkly jumpsuit with a white fur coat.  “Khloé was beaming all night,” the insider says of the 33-year-old Revenge Body host. “She kept touching and showing off her cute baby belly.”  Khloé showed off her bump on Instagram as well.  “Merry Christmas!! May you sparkle and shine this festive season, may all of your wishes and dreams come true,” Khloé captioned a gallery of shots showing her touching her belly. “I pray that we all may feel this happiness all year round. God bless you! ✨ #BabyBump🤗”  “Merry Christmas!!!!! Wishing all of you and your families much Joy Happiness Peace and Health…” Kris added in her own post, a photo of her and Khloé alongside Kendall Jenner. “Love you guys!!!!!!!! #christmas #blessed #ohholynight.”  Kim Kardashian West, Kris Jenner and Khloé Kardashian Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  Khloé Kardashian and Scott Disic Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  Aside for Khloé and Kendall, Kris’ party also brought together siblings Kim Kardashian West (who’s expecting her third child, via a surrogate), Kourtney Kardashian, and their kids: Kim’s daughter North, 4, and son Saint, 2; and Kourtney son Reign, 3, daughter Penelope, 5, and son Mason, 8.  Kourtney’s ex-boyfriend Scott Disick was there, too — without girlfriend Sofia Richie.  “He mingled, looked good and didn’t drink,” the source says, adding that there wasn’t any awkwardness with Kourtney’s new boyfriend Younes Bendjima.  “Kourtney seemed so happy that Younes joined her,” the insider says. “They are so cute together. He kept bringing her drinks and doting on her. Younes fits right into the family. He didn’t seem uncomfortable that Scott was there. They said hello, but that was it. It was very civil.”  Other guests included Kim’s husband Kanye West, celebrity hair stylists Jen Atkin and Chris Appleton, singer Christina Aguilera and Keeping Up with the Kardashians executive producer Ryan Seacrest. Kris appeared to be in a good mood throughout the night, dancing with Kim and Khloé and playing MC while Babyface, Toni Braxton and Brian McKnight performed.  “Everyone had the most amazing time,” the source tells PEOPLE. “Kris always throws the best parties. It was all gorgeous. There was no drama.”  Rob Kardashian and Khloé Kardashian Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  Kylie Jenner and Khloé Kardashian Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  On Christmas morning, the family gathered at Kourtney’s house to open presents and celebrate the holiday in matching elf-patterned onesies and beanies.  “Merry Christmas! People think you weren’t there last night,” Khloé said to Kylie, 20, in one Snapchat video as the younger sister replied: “I was.”  “She’s a secret little bunny,” Khloé teased.

Kylie Jenner, the youngest member of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, may have missed out on the family's annual Christmas card photo shoot this year, but she did make an appearance at her mother Kris Jenner's annual Christmas Eve party in Los Angeles. Sources close to the family revealed that Kylie, who has been busy with her successful cosmetics line and her newborn daughter Stormi, was not present for the group photo shoot, which has been a tradition for the family for several years.

However, Kylie did make sure to spend some quality time with her loved ones on Christmas Eve, attending Kris's party at her Los Angeles home. The party was reportedly a star-studded affair, with several A-list celebrities in attendance, including Kris's boyfriend Corey Gamble and Kylie's boyfriend Travis Scott.

Despite missing out on the Christmas card, Kylie's absence was not met with any negative reactions from her family members, who are said to be supportive of her busy schedule and her focus on her business ventures. In fact, sources close to the family revealed that Kylie has been spending more time with her loved ones in recent weeks, and is said to be enjoying her time as a new mother.

With her successful cosmetics line and her growing family, it's no wonder that Kylie has been too busy to participate in every family activity. However, her presence at Kris's Christmas Eve party is a testament to the close relationship she shares with her mother and the rest of the Kardashian-Jenner clan."

Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward saying he confided in them that he was unsure of the paternity of the now-27-year-old.  Jan Ashley, who married the businessman after Khloe's mother Kris Jenner, said: 'Khloe is not his kid -- he told me that after we got married.'  And Ellen Pierson, 63, who married Robert in 2003 just two months before his death, has also come forward after eight years of silence to 'tell the truth' about the Kardashian family.  Claims: Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward claiming the lawyer told them Khloe Kardashian, left, was not his real daughter, like older sisters Kim and Kourtney  The reality star has hit back at the claims, calling them 'really low'.  In an explosive interview with Star magazine, Ashley said: 'He just kind of looked at me and said [it] like it was a matter of fact. He said ""Well, you know that Khloe's not really a Kardashian, don't you?""    'And I said… ""OK"" and that was it.'  She claims Khloe, who is married to Dallas Mavericks basketballer Lamar Odom, knew she had a different father to her sisters and younger brother Rob.  'Khloe brought it up all the time. She looked nothing like the rest. She was tall, had a different shape, light hair, curly hair. Didn't look anything like the other three children.'  Different: Khloe has often pointed out that she looks nothing like her older sisters and their mother Kris, far right, said once people asked whether she was 'the milkman's child'  Fighting back: Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter She said Robert, who is of Armenian descent, had told her that he and Kris were not sleeping together at the time Khloe was conceived.

'Any normal man would if they knew their wife had cheated on him.' Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter.  Daddy's little girl: Robert Kardashian, pictured with Khloe as a child, referred to having four biological children in court documents filed in 1999 She wrote: 'The audacity you have to mention my father’s name like this!

gossipcop-5865271192,1,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.

That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.

It appears that Katie Holmes is going through a tumultuous time in her personal life, with a series of reports suggesting that she is struggling to balance her relationships with her famous ex-husband Tom Cruise and her current boyfriend Jamie Foxx. According to sources close to the situation, the actress is finding it difficult to navigate the complex web of relationships, with her daughter Suri caught in the middle.

The rumors of Holmes' relationship with Foxx have been circulating for months, with some sources suggesting that the two have been secretly dating for over a year. However, Cruise, who has been fiercely protective of his daughter and his ex-wife, has reportedly been trying to sabotage the relationship, allegedly going so far as to hire private investigators to gather information on Foxx.

The situation has become so tense that Holmes has allegedly been forced to hire her own team of security to protect herself and her daughter from Cruise's attempts to interfere in her life. According to sources, the actress is determined to protect her family and is willing to do whatever it takes to ensure their safety.

The drama has also allegedly taken a toll on Suri, who is said to be confused and upset by the situation. According to sources, the young girl has been caught in the middle of her parents' bitter custody battle, with both Cruise and Holmes fighting for control over her upbringing.

As the situation continues to unfold, it is clear that Katie Holmes is facing a difficult and emotional time. The actress, who has always been private about her personal life, is now at the center of a very public and messy divorce and custody battle. Only time will tell how this situation will play out, but for now, it seems that Holmes and her loved ones are facing a very uncertain future."

A film from Universal Pictures based on Thirteen Reasons Why began development in February 2011, with Selena Gomez set to star as Hannah, before being shelved in favor of a television series and Netflix ordering the show straight to series in October 2015, with Gomez instead serving as an executive producer. The first season was released on Netflix on March 31, 2017. It received positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised its subject matter and acting, particularly the performances of Minnette and Langford. For her performance, Langford received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Drama Series. However, its graphic depiction of issues such as suicide and rape, along with other mature content prompted concerns from mental health professionals. In response, Netflix added a warning card and from March 2018, a video that plays at the start of each season warning viewers about its themes.[2] In May 2017, Netflix renewed 13 Reasons Why for a second season; filming began the next month and concluded that December. The second season was released on May 18, 2018, and received negative reviews from critics and mixed reviews from audiences. A third season was ordered in June 2018 and is set to be released in 2019. Critical and audience reaction to the series has been divided, with the program generating controversy between audiences and industry reviewers. Premise [ edit ] In season one, seventeen year old Clay Jensen returns home from school one day to find a mysterious box on his porch. Inside he discovers seven cassette tapes recorded by Hannah Baker, his deceased classmate and unrequited love, who committed suicide two weeks earlier. On the tapes, Hannah unfolds an intensely emotional audio diary, detailing why she decided to end her life. It appears each person who receives this package of old-style tapes is fundamentally related to why she killed herself. Clay is not the first to receive the tapes, but there is implied detail as to how he should pass the tapes on after hearing them. There appears to be an order to distribution of the tapes, with an additional copy held by an overseer should the plan go awry. Each tape recording refers to a different person involved in Hannah's life contributing to a reason for her suicide. The tapes refer to both friends and enemies. In season two, months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and the other people mentioned on the tapes, as well as close friends and Hannah's family members, become embroiled in a civil legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Alleging negligence on the part of the school, Hannah's mother pursues her perception of justice, while her reluctance to settle pre-trial and her personal circumstances eventually break up her marriage with Hannah's father. The story unfolds with narratives illustrating Hannah's story told by those who present in court at trial. Clay, who perceives himself as Hannah's failed protector, embarks on an investigation using whatever evidence he can find in an effort to impact on the civil case between Hannah's parents and the school. Clay also endeavours to expose the corrupted culture of the High School and its favour of wealthy, sports savvy male students over the average student, which especially compromises the integrity of young girls such as Hannah. Throughout season two, Clay appears to be communicating with the ghost of Hannah as a plot narrative device. Cast and characters [ edit ] Main [ edit ] Recurring [ edit ] Introduced in season one [ edit ] Josh Hamilton as Matt Jensen, Clay's father, a psychologist. Michele Selene Ang as Courtney Crimsen, a closeted student at Liberty High who is responsible for spreading rumors about Hannah to protect the secret of her own sexual orientation. In season 2, she comes out on the stand during the trial of Hannah Baker, confessing her actions against Hannah that landed her on the tapes.

Selena Gomez, 25, is seriously wishing Charlie Puth, 26, didn’t divulge their former relationship. A source close to Selena EXCLUSIVELY gave us the deets about how Selena reacted to Charlie’s confirmation that they dated. “Selena wishes Charlie would have kept his mouth shut about what they had because she is definitely interested in keeping that kind of stuff and her dating life as much under wraps as possible,” our source said. It’s clear that when it comes to who she dates, Selena apparently is all about maintaining her privacy.  According to our source, it’s only a matter of time before Selena responds to Charlie’s bombshell admission that they were briefly an item — and that Justin Bieber, 23, may have caused the two to go their separate ways. “Now, she will definitely have to respond down the line, and it’s just frustrating when people add their dirty laundry to a situation,” our source added. “She’s learned from the first time dating Justin and The Weeknd that less is more, which explains her relationship with Justin now being much more under the radar.” We reported earlier how Selena and Justin put to rest rumors that they had split by reuniting at one of his hockey games. While they arrived separately, the two of them definitely left together.  Time will tell if Charlie’s big reveal will throw a wedge into Jelena’s relationship, but all signs point to the two of them continuing to make it work in 2018.

Selena Gomez thinks Charlie Puth’s dating history disclosure was a mistake! A source close to Selena EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com her reaction.

In a shocking turn of events, Selena Gomez has reportedly expressed her disappointment over Charlie Puth's recent revelation about his dating history. According to a source close to the pop star, Gomez believes that Puth's decision to discuss his past relationships was a mistake.

The insider revealed to HollywoodLife.com that Gomez feels that Puth's disclosure was an attempt to gain attention and publicity, and that it has caused unnecessary tension in their friendship. ""Selena feels like Charlie's comments were a cheap shot at her and their friendship,"" the source explained. ""She believes that he should have kept his personal life private and not used their relationship to get attention.""

Gomez and Puth have been close friends for several years, and their friendship has been the subject of much speculation in the media. However, Gomez has always maintained that their relationship is platonic and that she values their friendship above all else.

Despite Gomez's reported disappointment, it's unlikely that their friendship will be affected by Puth's comments. ""Selena is a strong and independent woman, and she won't let Charlie's words get to her,"" the source said. ""She will continue to prioritize her own well-being and her friendship with Charlie, regardless of what he says or does.""

In the end, it seems that Gomez's reaction to Puth's disclosure is a testament to the strength and resilience of their friendship. Despite any perceived mistakes or misunderstandings, Gomez and Puth remain close and supportive of one another."

Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Yet — Kylie Jenner, 20, has not actually confirmed she is pregnant.  For some celebrities, this would not be a big deal — some stars get pregnant and do not say a word, even as “sources” and “insiders” dish to the tabloids, as illustrated above. For someone in the Kardashian-Jenner family, this is especially confusing.  After all, these family members have become international superstars because they share nearly every detail of their lives, even the painful or uncomfortable moments. As a result, people have become inexplicably fascinated by all of them (Kris Jenner, Caitlyn Jenner, Kim Kardashian West, Kourtney Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Rob Kardashian), which has fueled their multimillion-dollar franchise of reality shows and sponsorships.  So the decision to keep Kylie’s apparent pregnancy under wraps is very off-brand for the family. This month, speculation will probably hit even more of a fever pitch, as February is the oft-reported due date for her baby, reportedly a girl.  The non-confirmation of the news — reported by the tabloids in September and described as a “happy” surprise for Kylie and her boyfriend, rapper Travis Scott — has sent some fans into a spiral. On Christmas Day, fans melted down when Kylie did not appear on the family’s annual Christmas card. Starting Dec. 1, Kim released a new part of the photo every day, and many expected Kylie’s announcement to be included in the final photo shoot. No dice.

A source told Entertainment Tonight: ""Jennifer really relied on her friends to get her through the tough times. During that time, she was able to heal and be comfortable with dating again. Jennifer has never felt she needed a man, but she loves love. Jennifer is casually dating, but right now nothing serious. She is just having fun, seeing where things go.

They said at the time: ""In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation. This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship. Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly.

Hollywood superstar Jennifer Aniston has been spotted ""casually dating"" again, just months after her highly publicized split from husband Justin Theroux. According to sources close to the actress, Aniston is taking a ""seeing where things go"" approach to her new romantic prospects, signaling a shift away from the high-profile relationship she had with Theroux.

Aniston, who has been open about her struggles with the media scrutiny that came with her marriage to Theroux, seems to be focusing on her own happiness and well-being in the wake of their separation. The Horrible Bosses star has been spotted on several low-key dates with different men, with sources describing the outings as ""casual"" and ""nothing serious.""

While it's still early days for Aniston's new romantic prospects, her willingness to take things slow and focus on her own enjoyment of the dating process is a refreshing change of pace from the fast-paced, high-stakes world of Hollywood. As one source close to the actress put it, ""Jen is just enjoying the ride and seeing where things go. She's not putting any pressure on herself or her dates.""

For now, fans will just have to wait and see if Aniston's new romantic prospects will lead to something more serious, or if she'll continue to prioritize her own happiness and well-being above all else. Either way, it's clear that the Horrible Bosses star is ready to move on from her past and embrace whatever the future may bring."

According to eyewitnesses, Foxx was seen laughing and joking with his friends, at one point even busting out some impressive dance moves on the dance floor.

Magazine is reporting that the ""Wildest Dreams"" singer has been contacting her ex ever since he has been in New York City starring in the Broadway show called Sunday in the Park With George.  The tabloid is reporting that a source is saying that Taylor is the one reaching out to the actor since she feels she is now more mature than she was when they dated back in 2010.  The source said, “Taylor was so young when they dated, she wasn’t ready for a serious relationship, but now she’s showing Jake how much she’s matured. She’s excited to see where things go.”  In 2015, a rumor swirled around saying that the stars were in contact with each other, even though she was dating Calvin Harris at the time.  An unidentified source told Star magazine that, “He said he owed Taylor an apology for how things ended between them. In June, Jake ran into Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show and asked for Taylor’s new number. They’ve kept in touch, albeit secretly, ever since.""  This would all be so ironic since Taylor allegedly wrote the hit song ""We Are Never Getting Back Together"" from her Red album about the relationship after her ex's friend asked her if they were giving their relationship a second chance.  “This guy walks in who is a friend of my ex’s and starts talking about how he’s heard we’re going to get back together. And that was not the case. So I start telling them the story: break up, get back together, break-up, get back together — just, ugh, the worst! And I picked up the guitar and (songwriting partner Max Martin) said, ‘This is what we’re writing,’” she once revealed to GMA.  The lyrics in the track said: ""I'm really gonna miss you picking fights / And me falling for it screaming that I'm right / And you would hide away and find your peace of mind / With some indie record that's much cooler than mine.""  In the video for the song, the actor who plays the singer's love interest gives her a scarf which many thought to be a clue that revealed the song was about Jake since she had been photographed wearing one of his scarfs while they were dating.  Since Taylor is now single and so is Jake and they both happen to be living in the same city, we don't see how this could be a problem. There is no confirmation that this is actually happening though and a source close to them told Gossip Cop that there was ""no truth"" to the report.

If it makes Brad unhappy when he finds out, she’s fine with that.” She actually hasn’t even told her six kids about the alleged wedding for fear that they’ll spill the beans to their dad. Crafty!  As for the wedding itself, Angelina’s reportedly taking her closest friends and family to Cambodia, “her second home,” for a traditional Buddhist ceremony, according to the source. The wedding will allegedly take place on a wildlife reserve, wear traditional Cambodian clothing, and serve local delicacies at the reception. “Angie’s thinking of having Shiloh, Zahara, and Vivienne as bridesmaids and Maddox as the groom’s best man since Maddox sort of feels he’s the man of the family now,” the source said. Knox will allegedly be the ring bearer, and Pax will DJ and bake the cake for the reception (he did for his parents’ wedding, too!) It all sounds lovely, but how will Brad react when he finds out?

Lucky number 4? Angelina Jolie could be getting married again, according to a shocking new report! The Hollywood superstar has allegedly been dating a mystery man for months now, and hasn’t told Brad a thing!

Sources close to the actress reveal that she has been seeing this mystery man in secret, and things are getting serious. In fact, insiders say that Jolie is considering tying the knot again!

This news comes as a surprise to many, especially since Jolie and her ex-husband Brad Pitt have only just finalized their divorce. But it seems that Jolie may have already moved on - and is ready to walk down the aisle once again.

The identity of the mystery man remains a secret for now, but we can reveal that he is not a celebrity. According to sources, Jolie met him through a mutual friend and has been seeing him discreetly ever since.

While Jolie has not yet confirmed the rumors, her friends and family are said to be thrilled about her new relationship. And who knows - maybe lucky number 4 will be the one that lasts!

This news has left many fans of Jolie and Pitt in shock, but it's clear that Jolie is ready to move on and find happiness again. We can't wait to see what the future holds for this Hollywood power couple!"

gossipcop-860400,0,"Laura Dern in a still from Twin Peaks. Photo: Suzanne Tenner/SHOWTIME A few steps in to “Part Six”, we’re finally given some sweet relief. Not only is a cliffhanger from “Part Four” resolved, but we finally have our first look at Diane some 9,926 days after she was first mentioned in the series premiere of Twin Peaks. The moment occurs when Albert Rosenfield (Miguel Ferrer) ducks out of a rainy, cold night and heads into a sultry bar named Max Von’s, where he comes face to face with David Lynch’s longtime go-to lead, Laura Dern. Now, if you recall, the set up to this began at the end of “Part Four”, when Gordon Cole (Lynch) told Albert that, before they move ahead with their investigation into Cooper’s reappearance in South Dakota, they need to get him in front of one specific person. When Gordon asks Albert if he still knows where this person lives, he responds, “No, but I know where she drinks,” which made me think beyond the shadow of a doubt that they were talking about Sarah Palmer (Grace Zabriskie). Nope. Turns out that Special Agent Dale Cooper’s (Kyle MacLachlan) secretary, who until now has only been seen in the form of a tape recorder, enjoys a cocktail or two herself. But, let’s back up a bit, because there’s a lot to piece together here, including some newly recovered diary pages, which we’ll certainly touch upon.. “Part Six” opens where “Part Five” closed, with an increasingly bewildered Cooper standing near the cowboy statue outside the office complex that houses his workplace, Lucky 7 Insurance. A policeman patrolling the area attempts to shoo him away, but Cooper is unresponsive, tugging at the sleeve of his jacket and reaching out to touch the officer’s badge as if he’s two hours into an acid trip. The cop is nice enough to drive him home and his wife Janey (Naomi Watts) opens the door and confirms it’s her husband. Granted, the fact that she uses her husband’s full name — “That’s my husband, Dougie Jones” — is a bit odd, but the officers don’t appear phased in the slightest, likely because the night itself has been odd to say the least. Soon enough, Janey brings Cooper into the house and makes him a sandwich and even gives him a little bag of chips like he’s a child. She then insists that he go upstairs to say goodnight to his (would-be) son Sonny Jim (Pierce Gagnon), to which Cooper bumbles his way up each step and eventually sits on Sonny Jim’s bed, continuing to munch away on his bag of chips. In a classic case of Lynchian humor, Cooper offers a chip to Sonny Jim, who refuses it, citing his own clean teeth, and slowly places the chip on his cowboy-themed blanket. It’s all so perfectly ridiculous, and also a welcome reprieve from the madness — kind of like the daytime scenes in a horror movie. It doesn’t last long. Almost immediately, Janey screams for Dougie/Cooper to come back downstairs, and then shows him a file folder that had appeared on their front porch earlier, back when the cops brought him in. Inside the folder is a picture of Dougie and his sex worker pal Jade (Nafessa Williams), who he seems happy to see, saying Jade’s name out loud to an increasingly disgruntled Janey, who is sniffing and shaking like a rabid horse. Watts really shines in this role, and “Part Six” allows her to stretch her comically abrasive legs as a woman unhinged yet still in charge, a familiar archetype of Lynch’s oeuvre. As she prods her husband over Jade, Janey gets a call on their yellow kitchen phone, which is, of course, a landline because, again, what is time? It’s hard to hear exactly who’s on the other end, but Janey quickly lets us know it’s the thugs looking to collect on Dougie’s gambling debt, which has led to over $20,000 in debt. Because she’s all kinds of resilient — could you imagine running that household? — Janey agrees to meet the thugs in a nearby park at “noon 30.” It’s another strange detail that’s so oddly funny. Following this, Janey implores Dougie/Cooper to finish his work, lest he lose his job, and leaves him with his case files. Before he attends to his work, however, Cooper looks over to see a flash message from MIKE (Al Strobel), who’s in the Red Room of the Black Lodge and feeling around in the air with his one arm as though he’s looking for a hidden window. When he sees Cooper, he pleads, “You have to wake up! You have to wake up!” and then, after a beat, he insists: “Don’t die! Don’t die!” The significance of this scene is to remind us, in case we forgot, that Cooper is trapped in the life of Dougie Jones, so that Cooper’s evil doppelgänger can remain on the loose in this time shifting earthy realm. If Cooper dies, then Evil Cooper, still under the influence of the parasitic Bob, will have free reign. After receiving this message from MIKE, Cooper goes through the claim forms he brought home from work and scribbles all over them with a pencil. He circles some things, draws what looks like a ladder, and then presses the tip of his pencil into a few heavy circles. As he’s doing this, pin points of green laser light — yes, the same green laser light that ousted Tom Sizemore’s character in “Part Five” — appear on the pages, and on his arm, as though it’s guiding what he’s doing. Now, comes the aforementioned moment, when Albert makes his way in the rain to meet someone at a place called Max Von’s Bar, whose sign looks a hell of a lot like the neon Bang Bar Bar sign hung outside of the Roadhouse in Twin Peaks.

Kim Kardashian, 37, is reportedly at her wits end when it comes to dealing with husband Kanye West, 40. She’s struggled since Kanye’s terrifying November 2016 breakdown, and she reportedly can’t see a light at the end of the tunnel, according to an insider who spoke to Star Magazine. “Between his raging ego and mood swings, Kanye has been a total train wreck,” the insider alleged to the Star. “Kim is stressed enough raising two kids and getting ready for the baby without Kanye dragging her down. She’s tried to hang in there, but she just can’t take it anymore.”  Poor Kim! We can’t imagine how hard it must be to have a family member — especially your husband — go through such a huge health scare. Of course she’s stressed! If they’re truly divorcing, things are about to get crazy. She allegedly doesn’t want to make any moves until after their third baby, which they’re having via surrogate, is born. As the source says, she’s totally fine raising the little one as a single mother. She’s Kim effing Kardashian!  “[Their divorce] will be all-out war,” the insider told Star. Kim has reportedly asked Kanye to sign a “mid-nuptial agreement” to protect her assets. Factoring in their revenue, from Kanye’s music, the KUWTK empire, and Kim’s various deals, including KKW beauty, it could be a $1 billion divorce!  Don’t think she’s happy about this, though. “This decision is agony for her,” the source said. “She still loves Kanye, but their marriage may be over!” This is so sad, considering what we just learned from a source. Kim and Kanye were happily including daughter North West in the conversation about her new little sister, the source told us EXCLUSIVELY. If they’re truly having problems, then at least they’re putting on a united front for their little ones.  HollywoodLife.com has reached out to Kim’s rep for comment.

Trouble in Paradise: Kim Kardashian West Considering Divorce from Kanye West

In a shocking turn of events, it has been reported that Kim Kardashian West is considering divorcing her husband of nearly six years, Kanye West. According to sources close to the couple, the reality TV star is said to be ""ready to move on"" from her marriage, amidst rumors of Kanye's infidelity and increasingly strained relations between the two.

The news has sent shockwaves throughout the celebrity world, as the power couple has long been considered one of the most stable and enduring in Hollywood. However, insiders reveal that tensions have been simmering beneath the surface for months, with Kim reportedly feeling ""trapped"" in the marriage and ""desperate"" for a change.

Kanye, who has been open about his struggles with mental health and addiction in the past, has allegedly been unfaithful to Kim on multiple occasions, leading to a ""final straw"" in their relationship. Sources claim that Kim has been consulting with high-powered divorce attorneys in recent weeks, signaling that she may be prepared to take legal action against her estranged husband.

The split would mark the end of a tumultuous and often headline-grabbing relationship that has captivated the public for years. Kim and Kanye, who met in 2012 and married three years later, have four children together, including North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm.

While neither Kim nor Kanye has publicly commented on the rumors, friends and family of the couple have been quick to defend them, insisting that the reports are ""not true"" and that the pair is simply going through a ""tough time."" However, with divorce rumors swirling and no sign of a reconciliation on the horizon, it seems that the end may be near for one of Hollywood's most high-profile marriages."

On Oct. 23, 2017, the Los Angeles Times published a report, claiming that screenwriter and director James Toback had sexually harassed at least 38 women (via The Washington Post). According to the exposé, Toback would often explain his Hollywood reputation to women he'd meet on the street, offering them a chance to be in his next film. Then, he'd allegedly bring them to his hotel room and ask them questions about their sex lives. Some of his accusers claim he'd then rub his groin against their legs or start masturbating in front of them.  Toback, 72, has denied these allegations, stating that he'd never met the women or, if he had, he couldn't remember their interactions because their meeting ""was for five minutes."" He also claimed that it'd be ""biologically impossible"" for him to have engaged in such behavior due to the medication he was taking for both diabetes and a heart condition.  It appears that many celebrities had heard rumors of Toback's alleged behavior over the years, and, as such, they wasted no time in slamming the Bugsy writer after the Los Angeles Times article was published.  ""The damn has broke. Women will no longer be silent. We have your back and will amplify,"" actress Debra Messing wrote.  ""One of the main jobs of a director is to create a safe environment for the actors. James Toback is a disgrace,"" Bridesmaids director Paul Feig tweeted.  Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn penned a lengthy Facebook post, describing how he personally knew at least 15 women that Toback had harassed or assaulted. Enraged at Toback's alleged behavior, Gunn wrote, ""For over twenty years now, I've been bringing up James Toback every chance I could in groups of people. I couldn't stop him, but I could warn people about him.""  ""James Toback damn you for stealing, damn you for traumatizing,"" Charmed star Rose McGowan wrote.  ""So proud of my sisters for bringing down yet another pig: James Toback,"" xXx actress Asia Argento tweeted out.  As Nicki Swift previously reported, McGowan and Argento have recently come out about the alleged sexual harassment and assault they were victims to at the hands of movie producer Harvey Weinstein, who faces accusations of sexual misconduct by dozens of women in the entertainment industry. After Weinstein's alleged behavior was exposed by both The New York Times and The New Yorker, he was fired from his position at The Weinstein Company, was left by his wife, Georgina Chapman, and became the subject of investigations by the NYPD, the LAPD, and London police.

Kim, I haven’t talked to in a year,” Jenner said while discusing her memoir at the U.K.’s Cambridge Union, according to Cambridge News.  Although Kardashian West publicly supported Jenner’s journey, she cut ties after reading her book, which alleged Kris Jenner — Caitlyn’s ex-wife and Kim’s mom — knew more about her gender identity crisis than she’s admitted.  In an episode of KUWTK, the KKW Beauty mogul also revealed that she had been hurt by a chapter in the memoir in which Jenner implied that her late father Robert Kardashian thought his friend O.J. Simpson was guilty of having killed wife Nicole Brown Simpson and waiter Ron Goldman — despite having served as the NFL star’s defense attorney in his 1994 murder trial.  “My relationship with Caitlyn was strained,” the mother of three said during the episode, which aired October of last year. “I was just trying to be respectful. But if you talk about my dad, I will cut you.”  Despite their estrangement, in April of last year Kardashian West told Ellen Degeneres that she would “always love her” for helping raise her and her sisters.","You are a journalist.

(Photo: Patrick Breen/The Republic) For a show that feeds on exposing private affairs and personal heartbreak, the application process for ABC's ""The Bachelor"" doesn't begin to scratch the surface. Phoenix, along with 15 other cities, was chosen as a casting call site for season 23 of the hit reality-TV dating show. I volunteered to brave the high heels and nervous laughs to see what deep, personal secrets the show would be fishing for. As a full disclaimer: I’m a fan of the show. I closely watched the last season, which featured Scottsdale ""Bachelor"" Arie Luyendyk Jr. Not only is he probably the most-hated man in franchise history, but he gave a dismal showing of his hometown on America’s TV screens every Monday night. Scottsdale turned into a place to go bowling and reminisce on the old days. Nevermind that Luyendyk actually grew up in Paradise Valley. While that season was a bit of a letdown, I didn’t let it shift my belief in the process. The show, now with more spinoffs to keep track of, has captivated audiences season after season, following young hopefuls searching for love. Was I looking for love? Absolutely not. Not quite like this, at least. But I had to believe there were some women auditioning in the hopes of finding their forever life partner on a reality show. What's in an application Arizona Republic reporter Rebecca Smouse poses for a photograph prior to auditioning for ABC's ""The Bachelor"" at McCormick Ranch in Scottsdale on June 16, 2018. (Photo: Elizabeth Montgomery/The Republic) I quickly befriended a young woman in the parking lot of The Scottsdale Resort at McCormick Ranch. We both had recently graduated from Arizona State University and decided to stick together through this journey. Following the trail of nicely dressed women, we wandered into a large ballroom to find what seemed like organized chaos. We were handed an application, a clipboard and a number. I was No. 72. A woman at the applications table said she expected about 200 people to filter through the resort by the end of the day. Phoenix has been a frequent destination for the show's casting calls, though few women from the Valley have been in recent seasons. Everything felt like a test. Candy placed on the application table? Avoid that. The ballroom, equipped with a DJ and an open bar, was decorated with women of all ages. Many were dressed to the nines, wearing beautiful dresses, tight fabrics and high heels. My parking-lot friend fit that description, dressed in a tube top and matching skirt with heels much taller than I could ever walk in. I was wearing a matching top-and-bottom set with bright boots and some accent jewelry. I wore an outfit that I felt matched my personality without trying too hard. Others arrived more simply in jeans and T-shirts. A young woman was dressed in a cow costume, clad with sparkly silver shoes, a bold move the producers would either applaud or completely dismiss.

We took our seats and began filling out a six-page-long application that delved into my dating history, employment and why I was looking for love on a reality TV show. The application offered some interesting questions, such as: What accomplishments are you most proud of? Are you genuinely looking to get married and why? What have you not found yet but would like in a relationship? There were also several questions on prior relationships and marriages. The application explicitly asked if we drank alcohol, only to follow up with the next logical question: What's your favorite drink? My newfound friend had issues with some of the questions, like what our salary was and what was on our bucket list. We both skipped the question asking if we had any interesting talents. The application was coupled with an intense release to agree to everything the producers may do if you get picked for the show. It felt like we were signing our life away, a thought that resonated with many of the applicants sitting around us. All in the name of love, though. Interestingly enough, most people I spoke with who were auditioning had not watched the show before. It seemed strange to me to audition for a process they had never seen on TV before. This would be like someone trying out for ""Survivor"" not knowing you will be trapped on a deserted island.

gossipcop-2950727916,1,"Caitlyn Jenner is putting her foot down and has refused to watch Megyn Kelly’s highly anticipated interview with the Kardashian and Jenner clans that is set to air in June.  Last week, pictures surfaced on TMZ that showed Mrs. Kelly, the new face of NBC, on the Los Angeles set of “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” after conducting a lengthy interview with Kris Jenner and all of her daughters – Kendall and Kylie Jenner, and Kourtney, Kim, and Khloé Kardashian.  It was made known that Caitlyn Jenner and Rob Kardashian had opted to skip the chitchat and for obvious reasons, Blac Chyna and Tyga were not invited.  As for Kanye West being absent, no explanation was given – as the saying goes, Kanye does what Kanye wants.  The retired Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete, who is currently promoting her new memoir, “The Secrets of My Life,” is embroiled in a nasty fight with ex-wife, Kris Jenner, and is said to be allergic to all things Kardashian.  Swish A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Mar 31, 2017 at 4:39pm PDT  A source close to the former “I Am Cait” star said she will not watch Kelly’s interview and added: “Caitlyn has no intentions on watching their interview with Megyn Kelly. She knows they aren’t going to say nice things about her, so why subject herself to the insults.”  The tipster went on to explain that the 67-year-old television personality is upset that her daughters – Kendall and Kylie – took part in the charade.  The person revealed: “She’s hoping her daughters, Kendall and Kylie, were able to persuade their mother not to discuss Caitlyn in-depth.Caitlyn thinks is awful that Kris is basically calling her a liar and possibly damaging her relationship with the girls.”  Kourt looking for zero fucks to give on her 38th bday looking soooo good A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Apr 18, 2017 at 7:34pm PDT  On the April 28th episode of “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” Kim slammed Caitlyn for attacking her family in her new memoir and for insulting her mother.

gossipcop-937542,0,"Mario Batali is under criminal investigation for allegations of sexual misconduct. The New York Police Department tells 60 Minutes that it has an ongoing investigation into the celebrity chef for potentially criminal behavior.  NYPD tells Eater that it’s looking at the assault allegations raised in the 60 Minutes report. Update: The Daily News reports that police are also looking into another, similar incident.  The 60 Minutes segment on Sunday took a look at several allegations against Batali, which first became public in a December Eater investigation. Anderson Cooper speaks with women who worked at the Spotted Pig, where Batali was an investor and allegedly groped staffers as a diner there.  The CBS newsmagazine show also spoke with an anonymous former Babbo employee who alleges Batali assaulted her in 2005 — claiming that she woke up after a party at the Spotted Pig with a “very deeply wounded” leg and something that looked like semen on her skirt. She later called a crisis hotline and went to a hospital to be examined, but ultimately, she chose not to file a police report. Batali denied the incident.  Police are also investigating another case after the victim reported the crime in March, according to the Daily News. She told NYPD that she had been drinking at Babbo in January 2004 and then blacked out; when she awakened, Batali was having sex with her, the complain said. She believes she was drugged. That investigation is also ongoing.  Batali stepped away from his Italian restaurant empire in late 2017 after allegations that he inappropriately touched women over the course of his decades-long career. At the time, he admitted that “much of the behavior described does, in fact, match up with ways I have acted.”  Batali and Bastianich Hospitality Group issued a statement saying that the other partners did not know about the allegations made public on Sunday night, calling them “chilling and deeply disturbing.” The company also noted that the terms of Batali’s divestment from two dozen restaurants across the country will finalize on July 1.  This post has been updated to include a statement from B&B, new information from NYPD, and a newly reported incident.","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news.

On last Sunday’s BET awards, it was quite clear that Jay-Z and Beyonce were not buddy, buddy with Kim Kardashian. In fact, the camera caught Jay barely acknowledge Kim when he was going on stage to accept his award with Kanye West. Since Jay and Kanye are not only music collaborators but close friends, will “Kimye” stand a chance?  Unfortunately, Kim cannot make Kanye’s friends like her. It will be Kanye’s responsibility to lay the law down with his buddies. He must let it be known that high school bully behavior toward his girlfriend is unacceptable.  If his friends continue to snub her, then the rap star will have to distance himself from his friends until they realize he and Kim are a package deal.  Although Jay-Z and Beyonce have preconceived notions of what Kim and the Kardashians are all about, they do not actually know who Kim is.  If they take off their judgmental glasses, they may even come to like her or at least tolerate her in their group.  Remember, if a friend is happy with their new significant other, don’t hate.

Or can friends “kill” a love affair?","Title: Can Kimye's Love Affair Survive the Cold Shoulder from Kanye's Best Friends?

As the world continues to obsess over the latest celebrity couple, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, a new challenge has emerged that threatens to derail their fairytale romance. Sources close to the couple reveal that Kanye's long-time best friends, Jay-Z and Beyonce, have been giving Kim the cold shoulder, and it's causing tension in the relationship.

According to an insider, Jay-Z and Beyonce have been deliberately avoiding Kim at social events and have even gone so far as to freeze her out of their inner circle. The reason for their animosity towards Kim is still unclear, but it's believed to be connected to Kanye's increasingly erratic behavior and his outspoken support for Donald Trump.

The question on everyone's mind is: can Kimye's love affair survive the cold shoulder from Kanye's best friends? The answer is far from certain, as history has shown that friendships can be just as powerful as romantic relationships in shaping our lives.

For Kim, who has always been fiercely independent and strong-willed, the snub from Jay-Z and Beyonce may be a difficult pill to swallow. She has always been the center of attention in her own right, and the thought of being marginalized by Kanye's friends may be a blow to her ego.

On the other hand, Kanye has always been a man who wears his heart on his sleeve, and his loyalty to his friends is unwavering. If he feels that his friends are being unfairly targeted or judged, he may be inclined to distance himself from Kim in order to protect them.

The fate of Kimye's relationship hangs in the balance, as the couple navigates this delicate situation. Will they be able to overcome the tension caused by Jay-Z and Beyonce's cold shoulder, or will it ultimately prove to be too much for their love to overcome? Only time will tell."

It wasn’t so bad on the scale of celebrity breakups, but after less than three years of marriage (a lifetime in Hollywood), it was a tabloid downer for a day or two.  In case there are still people busying themselves wondering if Aniston is happy (just a note, she really doesn’t want you to), please stop. According to the latest tabloid reports, she’s doing just fine. She’s reportedly back on the dating scene with two different beaus, per Us Weekly, and her friends are having trouble not talking about it. One man is reportedly a bachelor who recently split from his wife and the other is an “industry creative,” whatever that ever means. Neither of them is an actor.  But there’s no reason to believe we’ll learn more anytime soon. In July of 2016, Aniston wrote a pretty searing op-ed for HuffPost in which she scolded paparazzi that are constantly obsessed with whether she’s in love or having babies.  “For the record, I am not pregnant,” she wrote then. “What I am is fed up. I’m fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body-shaming that occurs daily under the guise of ‘journalism,’ the ‘First Amendment,’ and ‘celebrity news.’”  O.K., so, Jennifer Aniston is happy. She’s dating. This is great. Now time to leave her alone and talk about the fact that Justin Theroux knows someone in the South of France with a really great hot tub.

Date: March 16, 2023

Los Angeles, CA - In a shocking turn of events, Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux have announced their separation, just one week after Architectural Digest published a feature on their stunning midcentury Los Angeles home. The couple, who were married for nearly three years, have been struggling to keep their relationship afloat, and their split has sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry.

According to sources close to the couple, Aniston and Theroux have been leading separate lives for several months, with Aniston focusing on her acting career and Theroux working on his upcoming projects. The tension between them was palpable at the recent Academy Awards, where they were seen sitting apart from each other.

The news of their split comes as a surprise to many, as the couple had always been private about their relationship and never spoke publicly about their troubles. However, insiders say that the pressure of maintaining a high-profile celebrity marriage took a toll on their relationship, and they ultimately decided to go their separate ways.

The feature in Architectural Digest, which showcased the couple's beautiful midcentury home, was seen as a symbol of their love and commitment to each other. However, it now appears that the couple's relationship was already on shaky ground at the time of the publication.

Friends of the couple have expressed shock and sadness at the news, saying that they had always been a happy and loving couple. ""They were one of the most adorable couples in Hollywood, and it's heartbreaking to see them go,"" said one source.

The split between Aniston and Theroux is the latest in a string of high-profile celebrity breakups, and it has left many fans wondering what went wrong. However, it is important to respect the privacy of the couple and allow them the space to move forward with their lives.

In the meantime, fans can take comfort in the fact that both Aniston and Theroux will continue to be talented and successful in their respective careers, and that they will always be remembered as one of Hollywood's most beloved couples."

An official cover has yet to be released; however, suspicions that it’s coming soon have been heightened as DJ Snake posted a longer version of Gomez’s cover on his Snapchat.

From their whirlwind romance in 2010 to their most recent breakup in 2018, this couple has kept us all on the edge of our seats. And now, it seems that we may have reached the end of our 3,600-word Jelena timeline.

According to sources close to the couple, Bieber and Gomez have been spending time apart in recent weeks, leading many to speculate that their relationship has finally come to an end. This comes as no surprise, given the numerous breakups and reconciliations that have plagued this couple over the years.

Despite their ups and downs, however, it’s clear that Bieber and Gomez have a deep love and respect for one another. In fact, just last month, Bieber was spotted at Gomez’s birthday party, fueling hopes that the two were still on good terms.

But despite these glimmers of hope, it seems that the end may be near for Jelena. And as a journalist who has been following this couple for so long, I have to admit that it’s a little bittersweet to see them go. After all, who couldn’t use a little more drama in their lives?

So, as we say goodbye to Jelena, let’s take a look back at some of the highlights (and lowlights) of their relationship over the years. From their adorable early dates to their messy breakups, it’s been quite a ride. And who knows? Maybe someday in the future, we’ll see these two lovebirds reunited once again. But for now, it seems that we’ve reached the end of our 3,600-word Jelena timeline. So long, Jelena. It’s been a wild ride."
gossipcop-2388806885,1,"R. Kelly’s time may have finally come. R. Kelly has been accused of sexual relationships with minors going back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah. (The marriage was annulled.) In the 24 years since then, he has been sued multiple times for inappropriate sexual contact with a minor (he settled out of court every time), and he was eventually charged with creating child pornography. (A jury found him not guilty on the grounds that they could not conclusively identify the other figure in his infamous sex tape as a child.) Last summer, he was accused of creating an abusive “sex cult” of very young women, whom he allegedly isolates, brainwashes, and abuses physically and emotionally. Since the story broke, multiple women have added their own testimonies of abuse at R. Kelly’s hands. (Through a lawyer, Kelly denied all accusations, saying he would “work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.”) And in April, another woman accused Kelly of “knowingly and intentionally infecting her with an STD.” Her lawyers say they are currently preparing a federal civil lawsuit. Through a spokesperson, Kelly issued a statement to the Washington Post in which he “categorically denies all claims and allegations.” As man after man has fallen to the #MeToo reckoning, losing jobs and retiring from public life after being accused of sexual harassment and assault, there’s been a recurring whisper: What about R. Kelly? Despite decades of lawsuits and allegations, Kelly’s career has marched steadily on. Last year, he finished an arena tour with a few cancellations. This year, he’s touring with singer Charlie Wilson (some protests are planned). His music appeared in Pitch Perfect 3. At this year’s Coachella, rapper Vince Staples repeatedly referred to Kelly as a “child molester” in an interview with Complex, insisting, “He pees on people.” In our post-#MeToo, post-Time’s Up, post-Harvey Weinstein world, and given the sheer volume of allegations against Kelly, it seems reasonable to raise the question of why he continues to work as much as he does. But Staples’s interviewer only giggled nervously and protested, “We can’t ever talk about this guy. ... You’re about to get me fired from Coachella. It’s my first time here.” Later, Staples tweeted that “R. Kelly people is looking for me.” ladies and gentlemen, vince staples on r kelly pic.twitter.com/SmZdYu9PNJ — andy (@aboynamedandy) April 16, 2018 That stasis may be starting to change. Most of the claims against Kelly were reiterated in a recent BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes. And over the past year, at least five members of Kelly’s inner circle have left him. His assistant, his accountant, his lawyer, and his rep have all said that they no longer work for him, although none of them have gone into detail about their departures and all have been supportive and complimentary toward Kelly in their statements. His longtime musical accompanist, DJ Phantom, was less circumspect about his decision to leave Kelly in December: “I didn’t know then what I know now,” he said. “He’s a shitbag.” In April, the Women of Color committee within Time’s Up threw its weight behind the #MuteRKelly campaign, calling for anyone currently profiting from Kelly and his music to drop him, including Spotify, Ticketmaster, and Kelly’s record label, RCA. Shortly thereafter, Spotify announced that it would no longer be promoting Kelly’s music, although his music would remain in their streaming catalog. It’s possible that these new developlments mean things are changing for Kelly, and that he’s about to face lasting consequences for those accusations. But if that’s the case, those consequences took more than two decades to reach him. There is a persistent vagueness to the way we talk about R. Kelly that makes it possible to forget exactly what he’s been accused of, how often he’s been accused, and how much proof there is against him. And most likely, that’s because his alleged victims are overwhelmingly young black women and hence apparently easy for America to ignore. “The saddest fact I’ve learned is: Nobody matters less to our society than young black women,” says Jim DeRogatis, the reporter who broke the R. Kelly story. “Nobody.” To try to combat that vagueness and the erasure that it makes possible, here is a timeline of all of the accusations of sexual misconduct against R. Kelly. Much of the chronology here is drawn from DeRogatis’s invaluable coverage of the R. Kelly accusations, including his own immensely thorough timeline. DeRogatis’s timeline covers the entire span of Kelly’s life, including his major career milestones and unrelated legal issues, but I’ve narrowed the focus of this timeline to specifically the sexual misconduct accusations against Kelly. Over the 24-year span of this timeline, a consistent pattern emerges. Over and over again, Kelly is accused of the same behavior: of targeting girls and very young women, isolating them, and controlling and abusing them. And after the dust from the accusation settles, Kelly goes on living his life with very few changes. Here, from Aaliyah to the alleged sex cult, are all the R. Kelly accusations. August 30, 1994: 27-year-old R. Kelly marries 15-year-old Aaliyah The ’90s music sensation Aaliyah was Kelly’s protégé. They met when she was 12 years old, and Kelly wrote and produced her first album in 1993. It was titled Age Ain’t Nothing but a Number. In 1995, Vibe magazine published a copy of their marriage license, with 15-year-old Aaliyah falsely listing her age as 18. “Family members say Aaliyah thought it was all an elaborate ‘game,’ and she just went along with it,” the Chicago Sun-Times later reported, adding that the marriage license was reportedly obtained by Kelly’s assistant, using a fake ID. “Within hours, she realized what had happened, and she went to her family and sought their help.” The marriage was annulled in 1994, just months after the ceremony. In the settlement, according to documents obtained by the Sun-Times, Aaliyah promises not to pursue further legal action because of “emotional distress caused","You are a journalist.

R. Kelly's Time May Have Finally Come

After years of accusations and controversy, it appears that R. Kelly's time may have finally come. The embattled R&B singer has been accused of sexual relationships with minors going back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah. The allegations, which have been circulating for decades, have finally gained momentum in recent months, with multiple women coming forward with their own stories of abuse and exploitation at the hands of the singer.

The latest development in the case comes from a report by BuzzFeed News, which claims that Kelly has been accused of sexual relationships with underage girls as young as 12 years old. The report also alleges that Kelly's inner circle, including his management team and friends, were aware of his behavior and actively covered it up.

The allegations against Kelly are not new, but they have gained renewed attention in recent months, particularly after the release of the documentary ""Surviving R. Kelly"" in January. The documentary featured interviews with several women who accused Kelly of sexual abuse and manipulation, and it sparked a renewed outcry against the singer.

Since then, several high-profile celebrities have spoken out against Kelly, including Lady Gaga and Celine Dion, who have both apologized for collaborating with him in the past. Additionally, several major record labels and music industry figures have distanced themselves from Kelly, and his music has been removed from several streaming platforms.

The latest report from BuzzFeed News has only added fuel to the fire, with many calling for Kelly to be held accountable for his actions. The singer has repeatedly denied all allegations of sexual misconduct, but the mounting evidence against him may be too much to ignore.

It remains to be seen what the future holds for R. Kelly, but one thing is certain: his time may have finally come. The singer's legacy is at risk of being tarnished forever, and he may face serious legal consequences for his actions. The ongoing scandal is a stark reminder of the power of the #MeToo movement, and the importance of holding those in positions of power accountable for their actions."

gossipcop-7489249320,1,"Mark Wahlberg has come a long way from his Funky Bunch days. The successful actor has an important message for anti-Trump celebrities.  While being interviewed for Task & Purpose for his new movie “Patriots Day,” Wahlberg went after celebrities who “lined up to denounce Donald Trump is the months and weeks leading up to Election Day.”  “A lot of celebrities did, do, and shouldn’t,” he told the magazine. “You know, it just goes to show you that people aren’t listening to that anyways. They might buy your CD or watch your movie, but you don’t put food on their table. You don’t pay their bills.”  “A lot of Hollywood is living in a bubble,” Wahlberg continued. “They’re pretty out of touch with the common person, the everyday guy out there providing for their family. Me, I’m very aware of the real world. I come from the real world and I exist in the real world. And although I can navigate Hollywood and I love the business and the opportunities it’s afforded me, I also understand what it’s like not to have all that.”  Wahlberg’s point is well taken. What makes Hollywood liberals qualified to speak on politics? They should have respect for the President of the United States.  Do you agree?","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news. The writing style should be serious and convincing. Do not generate any other word. The 'sentence' is: ",Mark Wahlberg has come a long way from his Funky Bunch days. The successful actor has an important message for anti-Trump celebrities.,"Here is the news piece based on the sentence:

Mark Wahlberg, the actor known for his iconic roles in films like ""Boogie Nights"" and ""The Fighter,"" has come a long way from his Funky Bunch days. But despite his success, Wahlberg is sending an important message to his fellow celebrities who are vocal in their opposition to President Trump.

In an exclusive interview with our news outlet, Wahlberg emphasized the importance of unity and respect for the office of the President, even if one disagrees with the current administration's policies.

""As celebrities, we have a platform to make a difference, but we also have a responsibility to use that platform wisely,"" Wahlberg said. ""I may not agree with the President on everything, but I respect the office and the democratic process. I hope that my fellow celebrities will take a step back and think about the impact their words and actions have on the country.""

Wahlberg's message comes at a time when tensions are high in the entertainment industry, with many celebrities using their platforms to speak out against the President and his policies. While Wahlberg acknowledges the right of celebrities to express their opinions, he urges them to consider the potential consequences of their words and actions.

""We have to be mindful of the impact we have on our fans and the country as a whole,"" Wahlberg said. ""We can make a difference by using our platform to bring people together, rather than driving them further apart.""

Wahlberg's message is a call to action for his fellow celebrities to use their platform for good, rather than fueling the divisions that exist in our society. As the country continues to grapple with the challenges of the Trump presidency, Wahlberg's message of unity and respect is a reminder that we all have a role to play in shaping the future of our nation."
gossipcop-885356,0,"In anticipation of her next big moment, Cruz had an intimate phone conversation with a friend who has been there since the early days, before she made history: Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow.  GWYNETH PALTROW: I was trying to remember when we first met, but I’m afraid I can’t.  PENÉLOPE CRUZ: We had lunch at Madeo in Los Angeles. We were alone and talking about our deepest secrets, as if we had known each other for 20 years. It was around the time I was doing All the Pretty Horses [2000].  PALTROW: Wow. We’ve been friends for a long time. We’ve been through so much together.  CRUZ: And even though we live so far away and don’t spend nearly enough time together, when I see you, it’s like it was only yesterday.  PALTROW: I was thinking the other day about how you used to study dance. Was your goal to become â¨a ballerina?  CRUZ: That’s what I wanted as a little girl. By the time I went to ballet school at age 4, I was already asking to play the role of Carmen. I didn’t realize then that the reason I liked dancing was because it was just another form of acting. I was hard-core, training something like five hours a day, six days a week. But when I did my first movie, when I was around 17, I just fell in love with acting. That’s when I stopped dancing.  PALTROW: Do you miss it?  CRUZ: I miss the freedom I felt when I was dancing. I remember it as some kind of trance. I imagine singing is like that for you. You have such an amazing voice.  PALTROW: It’s totally like that. How did you get your first job?  CRUZ: I got an agent when I was 15, and she sent me to a casting for Jamón Jamón [1992]. And I got the job. For both Javier and I, that was the movie that actually started both our careers.  PALTROW: You were 17 when you did that?  CRUZ: I think I was, but I was lying so much about my age that I can’t be sure.  PALTROW: Most actresses try to make themselves younger, but you were making yourself older.  CRUZ: I’ve spent most of my career trying to make myself older, for different reasons. Journalists have been asking me, since I was, like, 22, “Are you afraid of aging?” That is such a crazy question for a 22-year-old girl or, for that matter, for a 42-year-old.

It’s not like I’m proud of the values I have, because I don’t feel like they’re up to me—they just come from the way I was raised. I’m rooted by the things I’ve seen in my mom, the things I admire in her. And in my father. When it comes to talking about aging as an actress, I feel like, “What the fuck? I’m not going to give you even two minutes to honor your question. It doesn’t deserve that.” Something changed when I gave birth to my daughter. I started thinking, “Come on, it’s 2017. Why do women still have to be talking about this? It’s crazy.” That sense only got bigger when I had children.","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news.

The 'sentence' is: ",0,"In anticipation of her next big moment, Cruz had an intimate phone conversation with a friend who has been there since the early days, before she made history: Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow.  GWYNETH PALTROW: I was trying to remember when we first met, but I’m afraid I can’t.  PENÉLOPE CRUZ: We had lunch at Madeo in Los Angeles. We were alone and talking about our deepest secrets, as if we had known each other for 20 years. It was around the time I was doing All the Pretty Horses [2000].  PALTROW: Wow. We’ve been friends for a long time. We’ve been through so much together.  CRUZ: And even though we live so far away and don’t spend nearly enough time together, when I see you, it’s like it was only yesterday.  PALTROW: I was thinking the other day about how you used to study dance. Was your goal to become â¨a ballerina?  CRUZ: That’s what I wanted as a little girl. By the time I went to ballet school at age 4, I was already asking to play the role of Carmen. I didn’t realize then that the reason I liked dancing was because it was just another form of acting. I was hard-core, training something like five hours a day, six days a week. But when I did my first movie, when I was around 17, I just fell in love with acting. That’s when I stopped dancing.  PALTROW: Do you miss it?  CRUZ: I miss the freedom I felt when I was dancing. I remember it as some kind of trance. I imagine singing is like that for you. You have such an amazing voice.  PALTROW: It’s totally like that. How did you get your first job?  CRUZ: I got an agent when I was 15, and she sent me to a casting for Jamón Jamón [1992]. And I got the job. For both Javier and I, that was the movie that actually started both our careers.  PALTROW: You were 17 when you did that?  CRUZ: I think I was, but I was lying so much about my age that I can’t be sure.  PALTROW: Most actresses try to make themselves younger, but you were making yourself older.  CRUZ: I’ve spent most of my career trying to make myself older, for different reasons. Journalists have been asking me, since I was, like, 22, “Are you afraid of aging?” That is such a crazy question for a 22-year-old girl or, for that matter, for a 42-year-old. I combat that craziness by refusing to answer the question.  PALTROW: It’s amazing, Hollywood’s obsession with the aging of women. And how much scrutiny we get for being whatever age we are.

Ailes resigned from his post leading Fox News last July, amid allegations of sexual harassment. He was 77.  Ailes helped found Fox News in 1996. On Thursday, the network initially announced his death by citing the Drudge Report, which had published a statement from Ailes' wife, Elizabeth.  According to Fox News, that statement reads:  ""I am profoundly sad and heartbroken to report that my husband, Roger Ailes, passed away this morning. Roger was a loving husband to me, to his son Zachary, and a loyal friend to many. He was also a patriot, profoundly grateful to live in a country that gave him so much opportunity to work hard, to rise — and to give back.""  Remembrances Roger Ailes, Founder Of 'Fox News,' Dies At 77 Roger Ailes, Founder Of 'Fox News,' Dies At 77 Listen · 4:36 4:36  Anchors of the channel's morning show Fox & Friends were noticeably emotional in announcing Ailes' death.  ""Beth, you are in our thoughts and prayers,"" co-host Ainsley Earhardt said, ""and so is Zachary, their beautiful son. Roger, rest in peace.""  Ailes was famous for his shrewd leadership of Fox, including his focus on airing conservative opinions and hiring anchors and reporters with big personalities. But he left Fox with a tarnished legacy, facing legal actions over allegations of sexual harassment.  Ailes denied accusations that he built a culture at Fox that encouraged harassment, after a lawsuit by former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson prompted other women at the network, including high-profile anchor Megyn Kelly, to step forward with similar claims. He abruptly resigned last July.  In the decades before he created a ratings juggernaut in Fox News, Ailes worked in politics, serving as a media adviser and consultant — most famously for Richard Nixon, whom Ailes helped to win the presidency in 1968. He later worked for other Republican leaders, from Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush to New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.  Ailes was a producer of the variety and talk program The Mike Douglas Show when he met Nixon. In the years that followed, as NPR's David Folkenflik has reported, Ailes ""kept toggling between producing television specials and serving as a political consultant, sometimes doing both at once.""  The architect of Fox News was also close to President Trump, to whom he gave a weekly slot on Fox & Friends — a show that the president has regularly touted in his tweets from the White House.  Trump ""sort of represents Roger Ailes' legacy of 50 years of using television to advance a style — a populist style of conservative politics,"" journalist and author Gabriel Sherman told NPR's Terry Gross last summer.  Sherman, who wrote a biography of Ailes titled The Loudest Voice In The Room, also spoke to Terry back in 2014, when his book was first published.  Discussing Ailes' impact on politics and culture in the U.S., Sherman said, ""One of Ailes' lasting legacies will be that for millions of Americans, news is now no longer viewed as a way to be informed about the world; it's a way of gathering information that advances your side.""","You are a journalist.

gossipcop-955765,0,"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle ‘Found Each Other to Change the World,’ Nacho Figueras Says  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s romance is one for the ages, according to their pal Nacho Figueras. The Argentine polo star, who appeared alongside the couple at the 2018 Sentebale ISPS Handa Polo Cup on Thursday, July 26, raved about the couple on Instagram and Twitter after the match, saying their love story serves a greater purpose.  “This girl really rocks. The more I know you, the more I am convinced that you both found each other to change the world,” he captioned a photo of himself presenting a trophy to the Duchess of Sussex. “Let’s push the envelope!! Let’s make the world a better place.”  Figueras, who is also a Ralph Lauren model, was on Harry’s team — the winning team — at Thursday’s match for Sentebale, an organization founded by the Duke of Sussex and Prince Seeiso of Lesotho. Sentebale aims to “become the leading organization in the provision of psychosocial support for children living with HIV in Southern Africa,” according to its website.  Thursday’s match raised more than £1 million for the charity. “@sentebale currently reaches nearly 4,000 young people a year with our unique programme of psychosocial support, so they can live long, happy, healthy lives,” Figueras captioned another photo. On a throwback pic of himself with Harry, he added that it was “an honor to be the captain of the @stregishotels Polo Team playing with this great man for a great cause.”  Figueras made headlines earlier this week when a photo of him with the royal couple went viral and sparked a series of memes. The image showed Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan celebrating his team’s victory with a kiss, as Figueras stood next to them awkwardly, trying to hand them the trophy.  Fortunately, the athlete had a good sense of humor about the situation and even joked about being the newlyweds’ third wheel in one of his posts. “When you wished the trophy would turn into a violin,” he quipped. “What an incredible love story.”  (photos via Chris Jackson/Getty Images)","You are a journalist.

gossipcop-9447768564,1,"Justin Bieber’s struggling with his split from Selena Gomez as she’s all smiles on her Australian vacation, a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Here’s how the Biebs is coping with his time apart from Sel.  Justin Bieber, 24, is going through a tough time as his relationship with Selena Gomez, 25, is on pause. She’s currently on vacation with friends in Sydney, Australia, where she appears to be carefree in this new video. However, a source reveals that the same can’t be said for Bieber. “Justin has Selena on the brain constantly. He is trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time but he keeps thinking about her,” a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “He always wants to be around her, talk to her and be with her. She is like a drug for him, he just needs more and more and more.”  As the Biebs continues to struggle with their time apart, he’s got a few things up his sleeve for when she returns to LA. “He can’t wait until she is back because he wants to really wine and dine her upon her return and really kick start the relationship back up again,” the insider reveals. It’s unclear when Sel is scheduled to return to the West Coast. But, as seen on her Instagram, she is having the time of her life. She posted a video which showed her laughing on a boat, accompanied by a subliminal message, that she “chose” to take care of herself, “not to prove anything to anyone.” Was she trying to give us insight into her most recent split with Bieber?  Jelena fans went into panic mode after seeing Sel in the arms of another man on a boat on March 19. She was photographed hugging and goofing off in photos with Sydney native, Johnny Rays. While all signs point to a friendship between the two, the photos didn’t appear that way to some fans who claimed they looked too close for comfort.  While Sel has been vacationing Down Under, Bieber has been staying active. He’s been photographed playing hockey and soccer with friends. However, his emotions may be getting the best of him as he took a gnarly fall during a soccer game on March 19, and seemingly broke down on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.  As you may recall, Jelena reunited in October 2017, after her split with The Weeknd, 28. They seemed inseparable, having spent New Year’s together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, their romance took a rocky turn around Bieber’s birthday on March 1, according to reports.","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news.

But Stone, 30, is the first woman he has been spotted with since the breakup.

gossipcop-28284230,1,"Not so fast! Madonna was hit with a series of “uncomfortable questions” by a judge before she was granted permission to adopt her 4-year-old twin girls from Malawi, the presiding judge said in court documents obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, February 8.  “The petitioner is a professional performer and I guarded myself against the danger of her merely reciting a well-rehearsed speech by asking her some rather uncomfortable questions to which she gave very candid answers,” Judge Fiona Mwale said in her ruling, explaining her reasons for approving the adoption.  After pressing Madonna, 58, to explain her intentions in adding two more little ones to her brood of four, Judge Mwale said she was satisfied that the girls would be in good hands with the Material Girl.  “There is no doubt that the petitioner can offer the infants not only the best education money can buy, but also guidance with a high likelihood of ensuring that the two infants grow to be self-sufficient adults,” Judge Mwale said, adding that she is satisfied that Madonna “is motivated by her desire to offer a home, love, protection and guidance to the infants.”  In the court documents, Judge Mwale addressed prior controversies surrounding Madonna’s adoptions in Malawi. “In determining her motives, I questioned the petitioner at length about the impact of her decision which could be construed as robbing Malawi of its most precious resource, its children,” the judge wrote.  As previously reported, Madonna filed for adoption in High Court in Malawi on January 25 but tried to keep the process under wraps until a final decision was made. (The Queen of Pop issued a statement denying her adoption to Us Weekly that same day, claiming that she was in Malawi “to check on the children’s hospital in Blantyre.”) According to the AP, she has already raised $7.5 million for a pediatric surgery ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, which is set to open early next year.  Madonna previously adopted son David and daughter Mercy James, both 11, from Malawi in 2008 and 2009, respectively. She is also mom to daughter Lourdes, 20, whom she shares with ex Carlos Leon, and son Rocco, 16, whom she shares with ex-husband Guy Ritchie.  Madonna’s twin girls will retain their birth names as a part of an effort to preserve their identity as Malawian nationals, the court documents said, and their father was at the January 25 court hearing with Madonna. (The twins’ mother died within a week of childbirth due to health complications.)  On Wednesday, February 8, Madonna took to social media to share the happy news. “I can officially confirm I have completed the process of adopting twin sisters from Malawi and am overjoyed that they are now part of our family,” she captioned an image of herself walking between the two little girls. “I am deeply grateful to all those in Malawi who helped make this possible, and I ask the media please to respect our privacy during this transitional time. 🙏🏻 Thank you also to my friends, family and my very large team for all your support and Love!”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

The judge said he had to ask some tough questions to ensure the pop star was fit to be a mother to the girls.

According to the court documents, the judge asked Madonna about her plans for the girls' upbringing, including their education, religion, and whether she would raise them in the United States or Malawi. The judge also inquired about Madonna's own upbringing and how she would ensure the girls would be raised with the same values and beliefs as her own children.

The judge also asked about Madonna's career and how it would affect the girls' lives, as well as her plans for their future. The judge said he wanted to ensure that the girls would be raised in a stable and loving home.

Despite the tough questions, the judge ultimately granted Madonna's adoption request, saying she had proven herself to be a fit and loving mother. The judge's decision was met with cheers from Madonna's supporters in the courtroom.

In a statement, Madonna thanked the judge for his thorough review of her application and vowed to provide a loving and stable home for her new daughters. She also praised the Malawian court system for its fairness and professionalism.

The adoption of the twin girls, whose names are Estere and Stelle, brings the total number of children Madonna has adopted from Malawi to four. She has two other children, David Banda and Mercy James, who were also adopted from the country."

In an effort to finalize their divorce and custody agreements, the judge has granted the exes another 12 months to come to a mutual agreement.

As per the source, the extension was granted due to the 'complex nature of the case' and the need for more time to ensure a fair and just outcome for all parties involved. The couple's legal teams have been working tirelessly to reach a settlement, but have been met with several obstacles along the way. Despite the delay, both parties remain committed to finding a resolution that prioritizes the well-being and best interests of their children. The couple's divorce proceedings have been ongoing since 2016, with multiple extensions and setbacks along the way. The ongoing negotiations have been shrouded in secrecy, with both sides tight-lipped about the details of the case. However, sources close to the couple have revealed that the main sticking point is the custody arrangement for their six children, with both sides seeking primary custody. The couple's eldest child, Maddox, has reportedly expressed his desire to live with his father, while the other children are said to be seeking joint custody. The judge's extension has thrown a spanner in the works, but both parties remain hopeful that a resolution can be reached in the near future.

gossipcop-880467,0,"Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied  Jamie Lee Curtis says in a new interview that she'd happily reprise her iconic role as Laurie Strode in a sequel to 2018's Halloween revival, if director David Gordon Green returns. There's no question that the newest Halloween, which wipes the slate clean with all other sequels in the long-running franchise, is a rousing success. Strong critical reviews gave way to a massive debut at the box office, one of the highest ever in October.  Green's Halloween certainly benefited from a return to the same basic premise as John Carpenter's classic original, trading in decades of increasingly messy follow-ups for a direct line to the Michael Myers that terrified audiences in the first place. The director went back to basics for this one as he avoided the supernatural and went for a renewed focus on the psychological. Clearly, Curtis was happy with the job that Green did, as are theatergoers. And despite the film's commercial success, that's likely not on the legendary actress' radar as far as whether she'd do another Halloween. But the director is.  Related: Halloween's 5 Timelines Explained (And Which Movies You MUST See)  As she explained simply in a new interview with Empire Magazine Australia (via Bloody Disgusting), Curtis says she'd be in for another Halloween sequel if Green takes the helm once again. It's certainly possible, since the original plan from Blumhouse was to shoot two Halloween sequels back-to-back. Producers ultimately decided that making two films at once was too risky. But now, it sure looks like another film will follow, with or without Green behind the cameras. ""If David Gordon Green called me up and said let’s do another Halloween, I would do another Halloween,"" Curtis said.  Producer Malek Akkad expounded upon Blumhouse's decision to keep it to one sequel in a recent interview. Essentially, he found it too ambitious to shoot two Halloween films without knowing how the first one would be received. Well, the next Halloween is reportedly already in motion, but the latest report suggests that Green and co-writer Danny McBride wouldn't be on board for it. That could change, but if Jason Blum is determined to pull a Paranormal Activity and crank out the next sequel in time for Halloween 2019, he'll need a decision from the director pretty quickly.  It's also possible that money talks. Halloween is already becoming one of Blumhouse's highest-grossing films after just one weekend, and it's doing so on a typically tight Blumhouse budget. At over $90 million domestically already, the film has a good chance to ultimately blow by Paranormal Activity ($107.9 million) and Paranormal Activity 3 ($104 million) and settle in at No. 3 behind the studio's crown jewels, Get Out and Split. Green may not necessarily need the money, but it might be hard for the director to turn away from that kind of financial success, especially when he was originally planning to do at least two films anyway.  Still, based on Curtis' comment in her interview, she may not be interested in another appearance as Laurie Strode unless Green is back. It's hard to blame her; Green had established himself as a formidable cinematic storyteller with Stronger, and showed off his horror chops to thrilling effect with Halloween. He and Curtis certainly make a fine duo, but 2018's Halloween may ultimately be the only time they team up.

gossipcop-877012,0,"Flavor Flav needs money. So says a lawsuit filed in federal court Wednesday, in which Flav accuses Public Enemy co-founder Chuck D and two business managers of cheating him out of royalties and merchandising revenue.  Flav — real name, William Drayton — contends that his Public Enemy royalties have dwindled to almost nothing in recent years. In the last few months, he and his representatives have attempted to get a full accounting of the money owed to him, but have been thwarted.  Flavor Flav and Chuck D were the two core members of the group. Chuck D was seen as the serious musical talent while Flav played the goofy hype man. The suit hints at years of pent-up hard feelings over this perception of their relative importance. Flav contends that there have been many attempts “to minimize his role in the Public Enemy business” over the years, while managers continued to exploit “his fame and persona to market the brand.”  In addition to naming Chuck D as a defendant, the suit also goes after Gary Rinaldo, the group’s business manager since 2008, and Clifton “Greg” Johnson, who was until recently Flav’s longtime personal manager.  Related Chuck D Joins Universal Hip Hop Museum as Chairman of the Celebrity Board LeBron James and Channing Tatum Pitch 'Public Enemy' Lands at New Line  Flav alleges that he has not seen a dime in streaming or download revenue, and that the defendants have licensed Public Enemy’s image without his permission.  The suit states that Rinaldo “entered into merchandising deals for products as disparate as Public Enemy branded watches, dolls of Drayton and bicycles, all without consent of Drayton, all without advance notice or compensation to Drayton.” Flav also alleges that he was not consulted about a set of Public Enemy action figures, which were sculpted in Japan, and has received no payment from the sale of the toys.  This summer, Public Enemy made a new album, “Nothing is Quick in the Desert,” available as a free download for a period of just six days. Though Flavor Flav was listed as an executive producer on the album, he says he was completely blindsided by it.  The suit says that Flav was contacted this spring about the project, and agreed to come to California to record.  “Drayton was in need of money to support his family, and Defendants were aware of that fact,” the suit states.  Flav requested a $75,000 fee. After a day of recording, he was given just $7,500 and told that more money would be wired to him later. He says he went to his hotel to wait for the remaining amount, and when it did not arrive he went back home to Las Vegas. According to the suit, he did not believe that his recordings would be used because they were of poor quality, and was surprised when the album was released on June 29.  “He had never heard of the album, nor heard any of the final mixes,” the suit states.

The two are living separately in California. “Ellen can’t deal when Portia gets attached to anyone else, man or woman. But it works both ways. When Ellen kisses up to her famous friends, Portia becomes consumed with self-doubt,” the source told National Enquirer newspaper.  According to the newspaper, Rossi’s friends suggested her to seek therapy but the “Nip/Tuck” actress was “resisting help.”  “Ellen has been in counselling, both solo and with Portia. Part of their therapy is to go on more date nights. That’s why they’ve been seen out and about more together lately.

The 'sentence' is: ","TV host Ellen DeGenres’s wife Portia de Rossi has been cutting her wrists to cope with their marital problems, reports aceshowbiz.com.","As a journalist, I have a responsibility to report on important and newsworthy events. Recently, I have come across a disturbing report about Ellen DeGeneres and her wife Portia de Rossi. According to aceshowbiz.com, Portia has been struggling with their marital problems and has resorted to self-harming behaviors.

Sources close to the couple have revealed that Portia has been cutting her wrists as a way to cope with the stress and tension that has been building in their relationship. This is a deeply troubling development, and it is important that we take a closer look at the factors that may have contributed to this situation.

First and foremost, it is important to acknowledge that Portia's struggles are not a reflection on her own personal failings. Self-harm is a common symptom of deeper issues, such as depression, anxiety, and trauma. It is not uncommon for individuals to turn to self-harm as a way to cope with overwhelming emotions and feelings of helplessness.

Furthermore, it is important to recognize that Ellen and Portia's relationship has been under scrutiny for some time now. The couple has been married for over a decade, and while they have always presented a united front to the public, there have been rumors of tension and infidelity. It is possible that these underlying issues have contributed to Portia's struggles.

As a society, we need to take a closer look at the impact that celebrity culture can have on individuals and relationships. The pressure to maintain a perfect image can be overwhelming, and it can lead to unhealthy behaviors such as self-harm and substance abuse. We need to support our celebrities and hold them accountable for their well-being, rather than perpetuating a culture of silence and stigma.

In conclusion, the news that Portia de Rossi has been struggling with self-harm is a sobering reminder of the challenges that even the most seemingly perfect celebrities can face. We need to take a closer look at the factors that may have contributed to this situation, and we need to support Portia and Ellen as they work through these issues. The health and well-being of our celebrities is just as important as their public image."

Add The Bachelorette as an interest to stay up to date on the latest The Bachelorette news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest  After weeks of narrowing down her suitors from 31 men, the 32-year-old trial attorney from Dallas chose the 37-year-old Colombian chiropractor living in Miami.  Abasolo had sparks with Lindsay from the very first episode of the show’s latest season, even passionately kissing her before the competition. The bold move not only helped him secure the first impression rose, but also, it seems, solidified a permanent place in Lindsay's heart.  Lindsay chose her fiancé over finalists Peter Kraus, the 31-year-old business owner from Madison, Wisconsin, and Eric Bigger, the 29-year-old Baltimore native.

gossipcop-902055,0,"Christmas is a time for goodwill, seasonal cheer, and forgiveness, so it seems fitting that the royal family is set to move past some recent rumors to once again celebrate Christmas en masse at the royal estate of Sandringham.  Despite talk of sibling rivalry, tearful duchesses, and diva-like behavior in the court of Kensington Palace, William and Kate Middleton and Harry and Meghan Markle will be together on Christmas Day, the Palace has confirmed. The news comes just after Kensington Palace attempted to snuff out reports of difficulty between the duchesses with a terse comment to The Sun over the weekend.  Although it is William and Kate’s turn to visit the Middletons this year (they usually alternate Christmas between their two families and spent Christmas with the Queen last year), royal sources say that they have decided to join the royal family for Christmas Day.  It is believed they will then head to Bucklebury, Kate’s parents’ hometown, to enjoy a second Christmas with her family.  Kate’s mother, Carole Middleton, revealed in her first-ever interview, published in The Daily Telegraph over the weekend, that she has prepared an extra-special Christmas this year to welcome the two newest family members, her grandsons Prince Louis and Arthur, son of Pippa Middleton.  There will be no fewer than 12 Christmas trees at Bucklebury Manor, the Middleton family’s home, with one just for Prince George to decorate, but the Cambridges will have to skip the Middletons’ traditional smoked salmon and Champagne brunch on Christmas morning because they will be with the Queen and the rest of the royal family at church in Norfolk. It will be the first time the Cambridges and the Sussexes, a.k.a the “Fab Four,” will have been pictured together since reports of a simmering feud rocked the Palace.  It was reported this weekend that courtiers have launched a “mole hunt” to try to uncover who has been leaking stories of tensions between Harry and William and Kate and Meghan. Reports of discord between the couples emerged after Kensington Palace announced last weekend that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would be moving out of Kensington Palace in the new year and into Frogmore House in Windsor.  Since then it has been claimed that Kate and Meghan don’t get along and that the brothers have fallen out because William voiced concerns about how quickly Harry’s relationship with Meghan was moving.  The Queen, who dislikes any rumors of discord regarding her family, will no doubt be relieved that the family will be coming together on Christmas Day. After the family celebrates with a turkey dinner on Christmas Eve, the sight of the foursome at church on Christmas morning will, courtiers hope, put an end to the unhappy narrative that the couples have fallen out.

gossipcop-881422,0,"Hayden Christensen (born April 19, 1981)[1] is a Canadian actor and producer. He began his career on Canadian television at the age of 13, then diversified into American television in the late 1990s. He was praised for his acting as Sam in Life as a House (2001), earning Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations. Christensen gained international fame for his portrayal of Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones (2002) and Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005). His honors for these films include a nomination for the Saturn Award for Best Actor and the Cannes Film Festival Revelation Award. Early life Christensen was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, to Alie, an American speechwriter, and David Christensen, a Canadian computer programmer and communications executive.[1][2] His father is of Danish descent, and his mother has Swedish and Italian ancestry.[2] Christensen is one of four children, with three actor siblings: older brother Tove, older sister Hejsa, and younger sister Kaylen.[1][3] Christensen was an athlete in high school, playing hockey competitively and tennis on a provincial level.[4] He spent summers on Long Island with his maternal grandmother, Rose Schwartz, and attended the Actors Studio in New York City; he studied as well at the Arts York drama program at Unionville High School in Markham, Ontario.[5] After accompanying his older sister to her agent's office after she landed a role in a Pringles commercial, he began being cast in commercials as well, including for Triaminic cough syrup.[5] Career 1993–2005 Christensen made his acting debut in September 1993, when, at the age of 12, he played a supporting role on the German-Canadian television series Macht Der Leidenschaft/Family Passions.[6] The following year, he had a minor role in John Carpenter's In the Mouth of Madness.[6] From 1995 through 1999, he appeared in several films and television series, including Harrison Bergeron, Forever Knight, Goosebumps, The Virgin Suicides, and Are You Afraid of the Dark?[6] He acquired wider notice while starring in Fox Family Channel's television series Higher Ground in 2000, portraying a teen who was sexually molested by his stepmother, and then turned to drugs in his despair.[6][7] Christensen's critically acclaimed portrayal of a misunderstood teenager in Life as a House (2001) earned him Golden Globe and SAG Award nominations, as well as the National Board of Review's award for Breakthrough Performance of the Year.[8][9][10] However, the performance did not receive widespread public notice.[7] In 2002, Christensen made his London theatre debut with Jake Gyllenhaal and Anna Paquin in This Is Our Youth.[11] He went on to receive good reviews for 2003's Shattered Glass, which tells the true story of journalist Stephen Glass, who was discovered to be fabricating stories as a writer for The New Republic and other publications.[12][13] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote, ""Hayden Christensen is sensational as Glass, finding the wonder boy and the weasel in a disturbed kid flying high on a fame he hasn't earned.""[14] In 2005, Christensen made his Broadway debut when he appeared briefly in a 10-minute play. In 2005, he took part in the fifth annual ""24 Hour Plays"" benefit, which raises cash for nonprofit groups in the Big Apple.[15] Star Wars Christensen in 2005 On May 12, 2000, Christensen announced that he would be starring as Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones (2002) and Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005). The casting director reviewed about 1,500 other candidates before director George Lucas selected Christensen.[16] Lucas is quoted as saying that he chose Christensen because he ""needed an actor who has that presence of the Dark Side"". This was essential to solidify the story that Lucas was trying to tell: Anakin Skywalker's fall from grace and transformation into Darth Vader. During the production of Revenge of the Sith, Christensen asked Lucas if a special Vader suit could be constructed to fit his own body, rather than have a different actor don one of the original sets of Vader armor worn by David Prowse.[17] Lucas agreed, and a suit was engineered to fit Christensen's frame, even including extensions to allow for the actor to attain Vader's 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) height. His voice as the ""robotic"" Vader, however, was dubbed over by James Earl Jones, who first made the voice famous in the original trilogy.[18] Stock footage of Christensen was used in the 2004 DVD-release edition of Return of the Jedi, where he was inserted to replace Sebastian Shaw as the ghost of the redeemed Anakin Skywalker.[19] This was one of the most controversial changes.[20][21] Lucas wanted Anakin's inner person to return to who he was before he turned to the dark side.[22] Christensen insisted this was done without his knowledge, an act that was confirmed by Lucasfilm itself in the featurette ""Return of the Jedi: What has changed?"" as seen on the official website to commemorate the 2006 DVDs.[23] His performance in both Episode II and III received generally mixed reviews by critics[24][25][26][27] (earning him the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor in both films).[28][29][30] Christensen was named in both People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People and Teen People's 25 Hottest Stars under 25.[31] For his performance in Episode III, he won the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain.[32] 2006–present Jumper in Rome in 2006 Christensen with then–girlfriend Rachel Bilson filmingin Rome in 2006 Between 2006 and 2007, he starred in Awake, with Jessica Alba, which tells the story of a man who remains awake but paralyzed during heart surgery,[6][33] and co-starred in Factory Girl, opposite Sienna Miller and Guy Pearce.[6][34] Christensen next co-starred with Samuel L. Jackson, Jamie Bell, and Rachel Bilson in the film Jumper, the story of a young man who discovers he has the ability to teleport; the film was released on February 14, 2008.[35][36] Bilson and Christensen co-starred again in the same segment of the film New York, I Love You.[37] Christensen appeared opposite Mischa Barton in Virgin Territory,","You are a journalist.

Early life Christensen was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, to Alie, an American speechwriter, and David Christensen, a Canadian computer programmer and communications executive.[1][2] His father is of Danish descent, and his mother has Swedish and Italian ancestry.[2] Christensen is one of four children, with three actor siblings: older brother Tove, older sister Hejsa, and younger sister Kaylen.[1][3] Christensen was an athlete in high school, playing hockey competitively and tennis on a provincial level.[4] He spent summers on Long Island with his maternal grandmother, Rose Schwartz, and attended the Actors Studio in New York City; he studied as well at the Arts York drama program at Unionville High School in Markham, Ontario.[5] After accompanying his older sister to her agent's office after she landed a role in a Pringles commercial, he began being cast in commercials as well, including for Triaminic cough syrup.[5] Career 1993–2005 Christensen made his acting debut in September 1993, when, at the age of 12, he played a supporting role on the German-Canadian television series Macht Der Leidenschaft/Family Passions.[6] The following year, he had a minor role in John Carpenter's In the Mouth of Madness.[6] From 1995 through 1999, he appeared in several films and television series, including Harrison Bergeron, Forever Knight, Goosebumps, The Virgin Suicides, and Are You Afraid of the Dark?[6] He acquired wider notice while starring in Fox Family Channel's television series Higher Ground in 2000, portraying a teen who was sexually molested by his stepmother, and then turned to drugs in his despair.[6][7] Christensen's critically acclaimed portrayal of a misunderstood teenager in Life as a House (2001) earned him Golden Globe and SAG Award nominations, as well as the National Board of Review's award for Breakthrough Performance of the Year.[8][9][10] However, the performance did not receive widespread public notice.[7] In 2002, Christensen made his London theatre debut with Jake Gyllenhaal and Anna Paquin in This Is Our Youth.[11] He went on to receive good reviews for 2003's Shattered Glass, which tells the true story of journalist Stephen Glass, who was discovered to be fabricating stories as a writer for The New Republic and other publications.[12][13] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote, ""Hayden Christensen is sensational as Glass, finding the wonder boy and the weasel in a disturbed kid flying high on a fame he hasn't earned.""[14] In 2005, Christensen made his Broadway debut when he appeared briefly in a 10-minute play. In 2005, he took part in the fifth annual ""24 Hour Plays"" benefit, which raises cash for nonprofit groups in the Big Apple.[15] Star Wars Christensen in 2005 On May 12, 2000, Christensen announced that he would be starring as Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones (2002) and Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005). The casting director reviewed about 1,500 other candidates before director George Lucas selected Christensen.[16] Lucas is quoted as saying that he chose Christensen because he ""needed an actor who has that presence of the Dark Side"". This was essential to solidify the story that Lucas was trying to tell: Anakin Skywalker's fall from grace and transformation into Darth Vader. During the production of Revenge of the Sith, Christensen asked Lucas if a special Vader suit could be constructed to fit his own body, rather than have a different actor don one of the original sets of Vader armor worn by David Prowse.[17] Lucas agreed, and a suit was engineered to fit Christensen's frame, even including extensions to allow for the actor to attain Vader's 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) height. His voice as the ""robotic"" Vader, however, was dubbed over by James Earl Jones, who first made the voice famous in the original trilogy.[18] Stock footage of Christensen was used in the 2004 DVD-release edition of Return of the Jedi, where he was inserted to replace Sebastian Shaw as the ghost of the redeemed Anakin Skywalker.[19] This was one of the most controversial changes.[20][21] Lucas wanted Anakin's inner person to return to who he was before he turned to the dark side.[22] Christensen insisted this was done without his knowledge, an act that was confirmed by Lucasfilm itself in the featurette ""Return of the Jedi: What has changed?"" as seen on the official website to commemorate the 2006 DVDs.[23] His performance in both Episode II and III received generally mixed reviews by critics[24][25][26][27] (earning him the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor in both films).[28][29][30] Christensen was named in both People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People and Teen People's 25 Hottest Stars under 25.[31] For his performance in Episode III, he won the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain.[32] 2006–present Jumper in Rome in 2006 Christensen with then–girlfriend Rachel Bilson filmingin Rome in 2006 Between 2006 and 2007, he starred in Awake, with Jessica Alba, which tells the story of a man who remains awake but paralyzed during heart surgery,[6][33] and co-starred in Factory Girl, opposite Sienna Miller and Guy Pearce.[6][34] Christensen next co-starred with Samuel L. Jackson, Jamie Bell, and Rachel Bilson in the film Jumper, the story of a young man who discovers he has the ability to teleport; the film was released on February 14, 2008.[35][36] Bilson and Christensen co-starred again in the same segment of the film New York, I Love You.[37] Christensen appeared opposite Mischa Barton in Virgin Territory,"

Title: ""Hollywood Actor Admits to Being 'Wasted' During Filming""

Date: March 25, 2023

Los Angeles, CA - In a shocking revelation, a well-known Hollywood actor has admitted to being ""wasted"" throughout the entirety of his recent film project. Speaking with The Times in an exclusive interview, the actor confessed that he was under the influence of alcohol and drugs during the entire filming process.

""I just got wasted the whole time,"" the actor revealed, ""You feel insane, but I think the studio cut my days because I started speaking total gibberish. I was like a broken record.""

The actor, who wishes to remain anonymous, starred in a highly anticipated summer blockbuster that has been receiving mixed reviews from critics. While the film has performed well at the box office, many have noted that the actor's performance was subpar and lacked the usual depth and nuance that he is known for.

Now, it seems that the reason for this may be due to the actor's state of intoxication during filming. According to sources close to the production, the actor was frequently late to set and often slurred his lines, causing delays and frustration for the rest of the cast and crew.

When asked about the allegations, the actor confirmed that he had been struggling with addiction during the filming process, but maintained that he was still able to deliver a good performance despite his state.

""I don't think my addiction affected my performance,"" he said, ""I'm still proud of the work I did, and I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to be a part of such a great project.""

However, industry insiders are skeptical of the actor's claims, and many are speculating that his addiction may have played a role in the film's less-than-stellar reception.

""It's unfortunate that this talented actor has fallen victim to addiction,"" said one industry insider, ""Hopefully, he can seek the help he needs and get back to doing what he does best - making great movies.""

The actor's admission has sparked a wider conversation about the prevalence of addiction in the entertainment industry, and the need for more support and resources for those struggling with substance abuse.

In a statement, a spokesperson for the studio behind the film said, ""We take any allegations of substance abuse very seriously, and we will be conducting a thorough investigation into the matter. We are committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for all of our employees and cast members.""

For now, the fate of the actor's career and the future of the film remain uncertain. One thing is clear, however - the entertainment industry must do more to support those struggling with addiction, and to ensure that the sets of our movies and television shows are safe and healthy for everyone involved."

Ricky got me good! I was so happy that I couldn’t quit smiling. My cheeks hurt!”  The 31-year-old fertility nurse met sales manager Angel on the dating app Bumble (“Ladies pick — finally it was my choice,” jokes Bischoff) last September; the couple moved in together in May.  “On our first date, we just clicked,” she says. “It was easy and that’s the way it should be.”  Still, Bischoff admits it was “nerve-wracking” to jump back into the dating scene after her painful split from Soules in 2015, nearly seven months after they were engaged. “I was still a little bit broken and trying to pick up the pieces. But from day one there was open communication with Ricky about what I had gone through. I think one of the reasons I fell in love so quickly is that I could say everything and know I was not being judged.”  Bischoff hasn’t spoken to Soules recently but says she wishes him well. “I hope that he meets someone, if he hasn’t already, just as great for him and Ricky is for me.”  Now, Bischoff still watches The Bachelor, but says she’s moved on from her own reality show past. “That journey was a big part of my life,” she says. “But since I’ve met Ricky, I really haven’t looked back.”  Busy with wedding plans (the couple are looking at a date next fall), Bischoff says she nonetheless has positive associations with the show. “It’s sad that it ended the way it had to end, but I was still looking for that perfect someone. I didn’t let my past close off my heart. Everything works out for a reason.”","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news.

Whitney Bischoff, the former Bachelor star who captured the hearts of millions with her journey on the reality dating show, chose to forgo the glitz and glamour of a televised proposal in favor of a more intimate and personal moment with her fiancé Ricky Angel. On July 15, the couple celebrated their engagement in a private ceremony, surrounded by their closest friends and family.

According to sources close to the couple, the proposal was a heartfelt and emotional moment, with Ricky getting down on one knee and expressing his love and commitment to Whitney in a touching speech. The couple then shared a romantic dinner and toasted to their future together.

While millions of viewers watched Whitney's engagement to Chris Soules on national television last year, this more intimate proposal is a testament to the couple's desire for a more private and meaningful celebration of their love. The couple has not yet released any official statements or photos from the proposal, but sources say that they are overjoyed and looking forward to starting their new life together."

Something as simple as a picture of Aniston with her hand on her stomach is proof enough for some tabloids that the actress is expecting a baby. Now, a new report claims that the Friends star has hired a surrogate, could there be any truth to the story?  In the new issue of Star, the tabloid features the headline, “Jen To Justin: I’ll Raise Our Baby Alone!” followed by a story that asserts Aniston wants to become a mom, and she will do it with or without her husband. The publication claims to have a source that reveals Aniston’s marriage is “on the rocks,” and she is planning to be a single mom.  ?…❤️✌️ A post shared by @justintheroux on Aug 5, 2017 at 4:23pm PDT  “Privately, she has told friends that she’s secretly gone ahead and hired a surrogate mother to carry her child to birth. And she’s vowed to raise the baby alone,” tells the insider.  But then the source says the actress is hoping to choose the right woman soon, completely contradicting the earlier quote, which is a huge red flag that something isn’t right with this claim.  But many think the tabloid story is completely false and contradictory quotes prove the story is garbage, questioning why the insider is sharing such private and secret information with a tabloid.  This is the same magazine that published a story earlier this year claiming Aniston herself was pregnant, but then didn’t mention that at all in its latest baby claims.  Aniston told Glamour magazine back in August that not only are the pregnancy tabloid stories guilty of body shaming, but they are also an invasion into a private matter between her and her husband. She said it is no one’s business whether or not she has a baby.  Jennifer Aniston went on to say that the subject of having a baby is a sensitive topic for her, and no one has the right to judge other people’s choices.

Ever since Jennifer Aniston married Justin Theroux, pregnancy rumors have followed the couple like a shadow. The latest speculation suggests that the actress is expecting a baby, with some tabloids claiming that a recent picture of Aniston with her hand on her stomach is proof enough of her pregnancy.

Despite the constant rumors, neither Aniston nor Theroux has confirmed or denied the speculation. However, sources close to the couple have denied the pregnancy rumors, stating that Aniston is not expecting a baby.

The pregnancy rumors began shortly after Aniston and Theroux tied the knot in a private ceremony in August 2015. Since then, the couple has been the subject of constant media attention, with many tabloids and gossip websites reporting on their every move.

While the pregnancy rumors have yet to be confirmed, it's clear that the couple is enjoying their married life together. Aniston and Theroux have been spotted on several public outings, including a recent trip to Hawaii, where they were seen soaking up the sun and enjoying each other's company.

For now, fans will have to wait and see if Aniston and Theroux will welcome a baby into their lives. But one thing is certain: the couple's love for each other is stronger than ever, and they are living their lives to the fullest."

gossipcop-5840642713,1,"Sky high prices are reportedly keeping fans from buying tickets to Taylor Swift’s upcoming Reputation tour, per a story by the New York Post. Though her 1989 world tour boasted numerous sold out performances (it eventually became the highest grossing tour of 2015), it appears her considerably more expensive snake persona is a tougher sell.  Last month, her “longtime” tour promoter told Billboard, “By the time all the tickets are sold next week, I’ll be celebrating Taylor’s birthday with a cocktail in my hand and sold-out concerts all over the world.” But her birthday has come and gone, and not one date has sold out.  Reputation was the biggest-selling album of 2017 and the tour is shaping up to be far from ill-attended, so the Post’s headline, “Taylor Swift’s Reputation tour shaping up to be a disaster,” is a little much. It does, however, highlight the problems with unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and Ticketmaster in general.  The company’s “Verified Fan” program, which they would like you to believe is all about rewarding music lovers, appears to be nothing but a cash grab that takes advantage of Swift-obsessed teens with easy access to their parents’ credit card numbers. People willing to drop $50 on merch, the Post reports, could “improve [their] position in line to purchase tickets.” And, once accessible, the tickets are often too expensive for many fans.  “I paid $150 for my ticket with amazing seats for the 1989 tour,” one fan wrote. “Now for the same seats I have to pay about $500.”  Advertisement  In related news, tickets to Katy Perry’s Friday show in New Orleans are currently starting at $23.","You are a journalist.

The 'sentence' is: ","Sky high prices are reportedly keeping fans from buying tickets to Taylor Swift’s upcoming Reputation tour, per a story by the New York Post.","Taylor Swift's Reputation tour is one of the most highly anticipated music events of the year, but high ticket prices may be keeping some fans from attending. According to a report by the New York Post, prices for tickets to the tour have skyrocketed, with some seats selling for over $1,000. This has led to concerns that many of Swift's devoted followers may be priced out of the opportunity to see her perform live.

The report notes that tickets for Swift's previous tours have typically ranged in price from $50 to $200, but this time around, prices have jumped significantly. Some fans have taken to social media to express their disappointment and frustration at the high prices, with one fan tweeting, ""I've been a Taylor Swift fan for years, but I can't afford to go to her concert.""

The high ticket prices have also led to speculation about the reason behind the increase. Some have pointed to the fact that Swift has not gone on tour in three years, and that demand for tickets is likely to be high. Others have noted that the tour is being produced by Live Nation, a company that has been criticized for its ticketing practices in the past.

Regardless of the reason, it's clear that the high ticket prices are causing some fans to reconsider their plans to attend the tour. As one fan put it, ""I love Taylor Swift, but I can't justify spending that much money on tickets."" The situation has left many fans feeling frustrated and disappointed, and it remains to be seen how the high prices will affect ticket sales for the tour."

gossipcop-888650,0,"AMC's zombie drama returned last Sunday with the season 9 premiere---an episode which marked an uptick in overall quality for The Walking Dead, but still made some old, avoidable foibles that almost look like bad habits at this point. New showrunner Angela Kang has been a writer on the show since Season 2, and it appears that even with improved dialogue and cinematography, she's been unable to shed some of the show's most annoying proclivities. Old habits die hard, it seems. But, like Gregory and a few other characters, they really do need to die. Let's take a look at three big mistakes the show made in its Season 9 premiere, and how each could have been easily avoided with a little more quality control and a little bit more courage. With some very small changes, this could have been a much better episode. Spoilers through Season 9 of 'The Walking Dead' follow. 1. The museum scene. Things got off to something of a bad start when our heroes went to D.C. I'm going to list this as a two-part problem. My first problem with this sequence is a creative disagreement with the show's producers and writers. My second is pretty much just the objective truth. First: An excursion to Washington D.C. to find seeds and other tools should have been a much more interesting, extended story. I think you could easily fit in an episode or two with a small group of scavengers going to D.C. and getting into various pickles there. That it was just one not very good scene at a museum really diminished something I was looking forward to, stripping of it of almost all its potential as an interesting little adventure (which the show has so few of these days.) Second: The museum scene was just bad. There was very little explanation as to why they needed all these heavy objects---surely there were more modern versions of things like carts and ploughs which they could find on farms or in hardware stores. Worse, the entire sequence with the glass floor was embarrassingly bad. The floor itself would not have cracked so easily. That kind of glass is made to withstand a great deal more impact. But even if they'd had it broken to begin with, making it more precarious from the get-go, there was no reason they couldn't have found another way around it. Passing items over the railing would have worked. Ezekiel could have avoided walking the entire length of the breaking glass by simply turning to one side or the other once exiting the stairs. This is a classic example of The Walking Dead's writers treating its viewers with contempt. We aren't that stupid. And neither are these characters. These hardened survivors of the apocalypse should know better---and would know better if they weren't continually written into these same corners over and over and over again. This entire sequence was insulting to our intelligence and had no business being in a premiere cable TV show. 2. The death scene. The second big problem of the night came shortly after the first. Our group, comprised largely of characters we know and then also one other guy named Ken, is bringing the museum loot back to Alexandria and Hilltop when a small mob of zombies shuffles up behind them. This leads to much fear and commotion, despite this being a much smaller zombie mob than we've seen the same survivors deal with easily in the past. One thing leads to another and they decide to all run away and, bafflingly, abandon the horses. In an apocalypse where cars are no longer an option, horses must be one of the most prized---and hard to come by---resources out there. But a few zombies can scare Rick and his band of hardened survivors away regardless. Utterly unconvincing. So when Ken (I think that was his name) runs back to save the horses we know right away he's going to die. For reasons the show cannot provide, a zombie manages to sneak up on him and nobody can get to him in time to save him. Maybe that looked okay on paper, but it didn't work on TV and left us with that bad, unconvincing taste in our mouths. The Fix: Now, you can fix #1 and #2 in one fell swoop pretty easily (but it won't fix #3.) Simply have the glass in the museum already breaking when they get there. Have them do everything in their power to avoid standing on it (like actual people with a self-preservation motive would do) but have something go wrong. Maybe there's one last item (like the cart) that they can't get around the glass and they lose control and instead of Ezekiel falling through the glass, Ken falls through the glass and is torn apart by zombies in the most gruesome manner possible. Now we can avoid the bad parts of the museum scene and cut the other scene entirely and we get a more shocking, gory death. Everybody wins! There's just one problem . . . . 3. Using a character we don't know as a catalyst for an important event. Don't do that. Every single significant death in a show needs to have a reason or serve some higher purpose, even if it just to shock audiences. Ken's death in the Season 9 premiere served a purpose, but it didn't connect with us emotionally. It was a catalyst for Gregory's final, fatal betrayal of Maggie. It led him to make a very stupid power play, the straw that broke the Maggie's back, as it were, when he got the blacksmith drunk and convinced him to kill Maggie. The problem? There's no payoff. No emotional weight. Because Ken was not an established character at all. He was introduced just to die. His parents were introduced just so that the father could become Gregory's tool in his latest horrible scheme. This is something we saw happen from time to time","You are a journalist.

Now we can avoid the bad parts of the museum scene and cut the other scene entirely and we get a more shocking, gory death. Everybody wins! There's just one problem . . . . 3. Using a character we don't know as a catalyst for an important event. Don't do that. Every single significant death in a show needs to have a reason or serve some higher purpose, even if it just to shock audiences. Ken's death in the Season 9 premiere served a purpose, but it didn't connect with us emotionally. It was a catalyst for Gregory's final, fatal betrayal of Maggie. It led him to make a very stupid power play, the straw that broke the Maggie's back, as it were, when he got the blacksmith drunk and convinced him to kill Maggie. The problem? There's no payoff. No emotional weight. Because Ken was not an established character at all. He was introduced just to die. His parents were introduced just so that the father could become Gregory's tool in his latest horrible scheme. This is something we saw happen from time to time"

gossipcop-6225895099,1,"Chris Soules, former star of ABC’s “The Bachelor,” after his arrest. (Buchanan County Sheriff via AP) Iowa farmer Chris Soules, a former star on ABC’s “The Bachelor” who charmed reality TV viewers with his small-town life, was arrested this week after police said he fled a crash that killed a fellow farmer. Soules, 35, was charged with leaving the scene of a fatal crash, a class D felony, and could face up to five years in prison if he is convicted. The case has garnered the attention of Soules’s “Bachelor” fans as well as residents of Arlington, Iowa, where he lives, who had come to appreciate the reality TV star’s work as an unofficial Iowa ambassador and farm industry advocate. “This story is going to spread like wildfire around here and probably all over because of who he is,” Mary Jo Brown, Arlington’s city clerk, told the Des Moines Register. “Sometimes fame isn’t your friend.” Soules, who also appeared in “Dancing with the Stars” and “Worst Chefs in America,” called 911 at 8:20 p.m. Monday evening to report that he had rear-ended a tractor on a rural road north of the tiny town of Aurora, about six miles away from his home. The tractor veered into a ditch after being struck by his 2008 Chevrolet Silverado, Soules said. The tractor driver — later identified as 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, a Vietnam War veteran — was unconscious and not breathing, Soules told the 911 operator, according to audio obtained by local media. The man had a pulse, but there was blood around his mouth, Soules said. Soules identified himself on the call, which lasted nearly six minutes, and sounded frantic. Between heavy breathing, he answered the dispatcher’s questions and took instructions. Soules told the 911 operator he did not know how to perform CPR and could be heard asking unidentified people at the scene if they could perform the lifesaving measure. The call ended abruptly after the operator told Soules law enforcement and medical first responders were on the way. “Can I, can I call you back really quick?” Soules asked the dispatcher. “Yeah, you can call me back,” she says. “Thank you,” Soules responds. Soules left the crash site after emergency responders arrived, but before deputies with the Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office were on the scene, according to authorities. Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Scott Bright told the Des Moines Register that Soules fled the scene on foot and later got into a truck. In police audio obtained by local media, a deputy told a dispatcher that Soules “took off” in a red truck. Authorities are trying to identify who picked up Soules in the truck, Buchanan County Sheriff Bill Wolfgram told the Associated Press. That person could face charges, he said. Alcohol was found at the scene and investigators are trying to determine whose it was and whether it or speed were factors in the crash. Soules was arrested about five hours after the incident and booked into the Buchanan County Jail, the Associated Press reported. He posted a $10,000 bond Tuesday morning and was released on the condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic monitor. During his first appearance in court, the Buchanan County assistant attorney told the judge that Soules refused to cooperate with law enforcement after they located him at his home. He “would not come out,” the attorney said, until officials obtained a search warrant, which “took hours.” Chris Soules making his initial court appearance in Buchanan County @KWWL pic.twitter.com/72bvEg0wVR — Elizabeth Amanieh (@EAmaniehKWWL) April 25, 2017 Wolfgram told the Associated Press that investigators were “running into some roadblocks when it comes to getting information” but acknowledged Soules was acting within his constitutional rights. According to court documents, Soules had several run-ins with the law in his early 20s. In 2011, he was charged three times with underage alcohol possession and pleaded guilty and paid a fine for an open container violation, reported the Des Moines Register. The following year, he received three citations for fighting and noise, unlawful use of a license and leaving the scene, which was amended down to defective brakes, court documents showed. Then in 2005, Soules was charged with driving while intoxicated and received one year of probation. A statement from Soules’s publicist earlier this week said he was “devastated” to learn that Mosher had died from the crash and that his “thoughts and prayers” were with the man’s family. Mosher, a lifelong resident of Aurora — population 200 — lived on his family farm near the crash site, reported the Argus Leader. He was married to his high school sweetheart, Nancy, and the couple had two sons and three grandchildren, according to Mosher’s obituary. An Army veteran, Mosher served six years, including a tour in Vietnam. He farmed his entire life and was a member of the Aurora American Legion and the Iowa Corn Growers Association. “Kenny loved playing golf, farming and spending his winters in Florida biking and visiting his mother,” Mosher’s obituary said. “His family was most important to him, especially his grandchildren.” In northeast Iowa, where Mosher and Soules both farmed, community members told local media they were heartbroken for the families of both men.

Reality TV Star Chris Soules Arrested After Fatal Car Crash

Buchanan County, Iowa - Former ""Bachelor"" star Chris Soules was arrested on Tuesday after he allegedly fled the scene of a fatal car crash that killed a fellow farmer. According to police, Soules was driving a pickup truck when he struck a tractor on a rural road, causing the death of the tractor's driver.

Soules, 35, was taken into custody after a witness reportedly saw him leave the scene of the crash. He was later booked into the Buchanan County Jail on charges of leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death, a serious misdemeanor.

The identity of the victim has not been released, but local authorities say the man was a fellow farmer who lived in the area. The investigation into the crash is ongoing, and police are asking anyone with information to come forward.

Soules rose to fame on the ABC reality show ""The Bachelor"" in 2015, where he charmed viewers with his small-town life and down-to-earth personality. Since the show ended, he has continued to work as a farmer and has appeared on several other reality TV shows.

The news comes as a shock after they called off a potential divorce earlier this summer and had been doing couple's therapy.

According to sources close to the couple, Kim and Kanye have been sleeping in separate bedrooms for several weeks now. This development has raised eyebrows, especially since the two had been working on their marriage and had even called off their divorce.

""They have been sleeping in separate bedrooms for a while now,"" a source told RadarOnline.com. ""It's not a permanent situation, but it's not a temporary one either. They are taking some time apart to figure things out.""

The news of Kim and Kanye's sleeping arrangements has come as a surprise to many, especially since the two had been so public about their marital struggles. However, it's important to note that just because they are not sleeping in the same bedroom does not mean that they are getting a divorce.

""They are still working on their marriage and are committed to making it work,"" the source said. ""But they need some space right now to figure things out.""

It's unclear what exactly is causing the tension between Kim and Kanye, but it's clear that they are going through a difficult time. Despite their efforts to work through their issues, it seems that they are still struggling to find a resolution.

For now, it appears that Kim and Kanye will be sleeping in separate bedrooms until they can figure out a way to work through their problems and find a way to move forward together."

Bring in a referee, talk it over, and I swear to you, it will dispel by the end of the session, each time!” he said. “Sometimes in a tough marriage, it’s tough to talk, but if you do, it works!”  The 77-year-old actor has also learned to maintain his marriage with Streisand by not interrupting her during hectic times.  “When she’s busy, she’s really focused, and part of our good relationship is that I understand that,” he shared. “And if I come to her with something important and she says, ‘I don’t have time right now,’ she doesn’t have time, period. That’s the way the mind works. You gotta focus.”  As for how Streisand, 75, makes him feel special, Brolin said, “I’m always welcome when I get home.

""Twenty years is a long time, and I don't have all the answers,"" Brolin admitted with a chuckle. ""But I do know that love, respect, and communication are key. We've been through a lot together, and we've learned to support each other through thick and thin.""

Brolin, 80, and Streisand, 78, have been married since 1998 and have two children together, Joshua and Samantha. Their love story has been one of Hollywood's most enduring and endearing, with the couple proving that true love can stand the test of time.

Despite their decades-long romance, Brolin insists that he still doesn't have all the answers when it comes to love and relationships. ""I've learned that love is a mystery, and it's different for everyone,"" he said. ""What works for us may not work for someone else, and that's okay. The most important thing is to find someone you love and love them for who they are.""

As they prepare to celebrate their 20th anniversary, Brolin and Streisand are looking forward to spending quality time together and reflecting on their years of love and happiness. ""We're just grateful to have each other,"" Brolin said. ""Twenty years is a long time, and we're proud of the love and commitment we've shown each other.""

Their love story is an inspiration to many, and their commitment to each other is a testament to the power of true love. As they celebrate their 20th anniversary, James Brolin and Barbra Streisand continue to prove that love can conquer all, even in Hollywood's fast-paced and ever-changing world."
gossipcop-3465787164,1,"A source tells OK! exclusively, “Heidi has nothing to talk about except her workout routine, how she avoids carbs, the tricks her private chef or personal trainer are implementing…it’s so tedious for everyone in her life, including Vito Schnabel and a big reason why he needs a break so often.” Ouch.  Heidi, 44, looks like a fountain of youth but it obviously takes more of an effort than we knew. But her loved one are over her ramming her perfection down their throats.  Adds the insider, “What also really annoys people is how Heidi fakes being normal. She even pretends to eat junk food when the cameras are on her but she hasn’t actually swallowed a bite of a burger in years.”  Just last month, she and her boyfriend spent time in Italy, so we really have no idea how she avoided the pasta and pizza!  “All she talks about is working out and what she’s eaten that day – which is usually not much more than a handful of nuts and steamed kale.” That doesn’t sound like fun.","You are a journalist.

Heidi Klum's Obsessive Focus on Fitness Driving Those Around Her Crazy

According to a source close to the model and TV personality, Heidi Klum's relentless fixation on her workout routine and diet has become a major source of tension in her personal and professional life. Speaking exclusively to OK!, the source revealed that Heidi's constant talk of her exercise regimen and carb avoidance has become ""tedious"" for those around her, including her boyfriend Vito Schnabel.

""Heidi has nothing to talk about except her workout routine, how she avoids carbs, the tricks her private chef or personal trainer are implementing...it's so tedious for everyone in her life,"" the source said.

The source also suggested that Heidi's fixation on fitness is a major reason why Vito Schnabel needs a break from their relationship so often. ""It's just too much for him to deal with all the time,"" the source said.

This revelation comes as no surprise to those who have followed Heidi's public persona over the years. The model has long been known for her dedication to fitness and healthy living, often sharing her workout routines and diet tips on social media and in interviews. However, it seems that this obsession has become all-consuming for Heidi and those around her.

The impact of Heidi's fixation on fitness on her personal relationships and professional life cannot be overstated. As the source put it, ""It's just so tedious for everyone in her life."" One can only imagine how challenging it must be for Vito Schnabel to maintain a relationship with someone who is so singularly focused on their own fitness goals.

It remains to be seen how Heidi will respond to these allegations and whether she will take steps to address the impact of her fixation on fitness on those around her. For now, it appears that her relentless pursuit of physical perfection may be coming at a cost to her personal and professional relationships."

gossipcop-858931,0,"The Leftovers has closed the book on its final chapter. The HBO drama from Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta aired its finale Sunday night, and it did so by offering more closure than most viewers had been trained to anticipate — not only for all the major characters but even for the show's biggest mystery. (Note: spoilers abound below, so proceed with caution if you haven’t yet watched ""The Book of Nora."") Lindelof had long tempered expectations about the finale, telling The Hollywood Reporter last year when he was writing the final script that The Leftovers is in no way a mystery-solving show. ""If the takeaway from Lost was that there was a disgruntled portion of the fan base that said, 'You did not give satisfactory answers to the mysteries,' then I feel somewhat liberated with The Leftovers because that’s off the table,"" he said at the time. But in an emotional monologue that concludes the third and final season of the thought-provoking drama, Carrie Coon's character Nora Durst actually provides one possible answer to what happened to the 2 percent of the population that suddenly departed years ago. Whether or not she's telling the truth is up for debate. Seated across from an aged Kevin (Justin Theroux), Nora explains that years earlier she got into a machine that transported her to a parallel earth where the departed now live. It was the closure she'd always longed for — except that when she found her three children and husband, it was apparent that they were happy and had moved on with their lives. Realizing there was no place for her in their world, she had the creator of the machine send her back home. ""I knew that if I told you what happened that you would never believe me,"" Nora tells Kevin as she finishes her poignant tale. ""I believe you,"" Kevin assures her, tears streaming down his face. ""You do?"" she asks incredulously. ""Why wouldn't I believe you? You're here,"" he responds before reaching out to grab his former wife's hand. ""I'm here,"" Nora echoes, her mouth slowing turning upward into a smile. And with that, The Leftovers concluded its story, leaving the credibility of Nora's account open to interpretation. ""I definitely feel like there are going to be people out there who watch the show who don’t believe her story,"" says Lindelof, ""and then for a lot of people, it won’t even occur to them to disbelieve it."" Ahead of the finale's debut, THR chatted with Lindelof about why not revealing the fates of certain characters would be a ""travesty,"" the questions he doesn't want to have to answer about the finale and whether or not he personally believes Nora (hint: he really wants to). Now that people have gotten a chance to watch the finale, what's the most surprising question you're getting about it? I can’t explain why it is surprising to me — I mean, I could explain it but I’m not going to — is why didn't we show the story that Nora is telling as she’s telling it? Was that ever a consideration in the writers room? It was something that was discussed very early on when we first were talking about the ending of the series, but once the storytelling process began and scripts started getting written, we landed on the idea of this season, if not the series, being about people telling stories. And, more important, people telling stories that would either give themselves a degree of comfort or that they believed would give comfort to others. That tradition goes all the way back to season one with Matt at the pulpit, and in season two, with Tom [Chris Zylka] speaking in front of the ex-guilty members like AA meetings, saying that he can give magic hugs. So, there’s always been a tradition on the show of characters delivering monologues that are fantastical or believable or unbelievable stories, with themselves at the center of those stories. They’re told in the first person, and it was sort of like, “Oh, yeah, how could we not end the series with Carrie Coon doing that?"" When did you know that this is how you wanted to end the show? Very early on. The holdover writers from season two got together in January, and all we talked about was, “What’s the last scene of the finale, and when and where does the finale take place? And what are the things we want to resolve definitively, and what are the things that we’re OK not resolving definitively, etc.” They were both esoteric, enthymematic conversations and then they became much more directed toward the scene we ended up with and we explored different permutations. It was always going to be that Nora tells the story of going through, but there were a couple different permutations of who she was telling that story to — and then it became very obvious to us that it had to be Kevin. That was locked in before we even started breaking the season premiere. Who were the others that you considered for her telling the story to? Erika Murphy was a contender, and then a grown-up version of Lily who would be maybe a 19- or 20-year-old young woman at the time that this would be taking place. Those were really the only other two contenders, other than Kevin. And how did you land on it being Kevin? Well, it isn’t to say that Kevin isn’t an incredibly important character in The Leftovers — of course he is — but I think the idea is that the third and final season was just as much about Nora’s journey as it was about Kevin’s. His journey would resolve in the penultimate episode and then her journey would resolve in the finale. And that’s inevitable for us because she just lost so much more.

gossipcop-904068,0,"Multiple women have accused Oscar-winning movie director Paul Haggis of sexual assault. Last month, publicist Haleigh Breest filed a civil suit alleging that the filmmaker, who picked up Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay Academy Awards for 2004’s Crash, of rape. On Friday, three other women came forward to The Associated Press with accusations of sexual misconduct.  Haggis denied the claims in Breest’s suit, which was filed in mid-December, and filed a countersuit, claiming the publicist and her lawyer had attempted to extort $9 million from him in exchange for withholding her suit. Breest claimed that Haggis assaulted her in 2013 after he offered her a ride home after an event, but instead took her to his Manhattan apartment; there, she said, he forced her to perform oral sex on him, fondled her, asked if she enjoyed anal sex and raped her. Haggis’ lawyer, Christine Lepera – who represented producer Dr. Luke in the wake of pop-star Kesha accusing him of sexual assault – said, “He didn’t rape anybody,” in a statement.  “Mr. Haggis denies these anonymous claims in whole. In a society where one of a person’s fundamental rights is the ability to confront an accuser, that right has now been eviscerated when it comes to anyone being charged in the press with any sort of sexual misconduct,” a rep for Haggis said in a statement to Rolling Stone. “Notably, no one has reached out to anyone on Mr. Haggis’ team other than the press to report this. He views the fact that these reports appear to be spearheaded from the law firm representing Ms. Breest, as a further tactic to try to harm him and continue their effort to obtain money … We reiterate our claim against Ms. Breest, and note again that we initiated the legal proceedings, not Ms. Breest.”  The new accusers said they felt empowered to come forward after learning of Breest’s story and seeing women report stories of powerful men engaging in sexual misconduct as part of the #MeToo movement. The women, who all chose to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution, claimed to have stories similar to Breest’s: they were all in their 20s or early 30s and they all said Haggis allegedly attempted to set up private meetings with them to discuss business but subsequently tried to kiss them. Two said that Haggis allegedly became more antagonistic when they resisted him.  A lawyer for Breest did not immediately reply to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment but told The AP that Haggis’ countersuit was “a preposterous and transparent PR stunt that will not succeed” and “a further act of aggression.”  One of the new accusers said she was 28 when the alleged attack took place in 1996. She claims she was working on a television show that Haggis produced when he asked her to review some photos from the show. When they met in a back office, she claimed he tried to kiss her. “He said, ‘Do you really want to continue working?'” she claimed. He then allegedly forced her to perform oral sex on him and pushed her onto the floor and raped her.  Another new accuser said she was in her 30s in the late 2000s when she set up a meeting with Haggis to pitch him on a TV show. She said that Haggis told her that he and his wife had an understanding about extramarital sex and came around a table attempting to kiss her. She ran to her car as Haggis allegedly pursued her, though she was able to drive away.  The last new accuser said she was in her late 20s in 2015 when Haggis allegedly held down her arms, kissed her and followed her into a taxi in Canada. When the cab took her to her apartment, she said Haggis allegedly tossed money at the driver, pursued her and kissed her again before she could get inside and close the door. She said that he then waved at her from outside her residence and claimed that he sent aggressive text messages over the next 24 hours until she blocked him. One of the women told the AP that he’d said, “I need to be inside of you,” before she was able to escape.  Outside of filmmaking, Hag","You are a journalist.

Breest claimed that Haggis assaulted her in 2013 after he offered her a ride home after an event, but instead took her to his Manhattan apartment; there, she said, he forced her to perform oral sex on him, fondled her, asked if she enjoyed anal sex and raped her. Haggis’ lawyer, Christine Lepera – who represented producer Dr. Luke in the wake of pop-star Kesha accusing him of sexual assault – said, “He didn’t rape anybody,” in a statement.  “Mr. Haggis denies these anonymous claims in whole. In a society where one of a person’s fundamental rights is the ability to confront an accuser, that right has now been eviscerated when it comes to anyone being charged in the press with any sort of sexual misconduct,” a rep for Haggis said in a statement to Rolling Stone. “Notably, no one has reached out to anyone on Mr. Haggis’ team other than the press to report this. He views the fact that these reports appear to be spearheaded from the law firm representing Ms. Breest, as a further tactic to try to harm him and continue their effort to obtain money … We reiterate our claim against Ms. Breest, and note again that we initiated the legal proceedings, not Ms. Breest.”  The new accusers said they felt empowered to come forward after learning of Breest’s story and seeing women report stories of powerful men engaging in sexual misconduct as part of the #MeToo movement. The women, who all chose to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution, claimed to have stories similar to Breest’s: they were all in their 20s or early 30s and they all said Haggis allegedly attempted to set up private meetings with them to discuss business but subsequently tried to kiss them. Two said that Haggis allegedly became more antagonistic when they resisted him.  A lawyer for Breest did not immediately reply to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment but told The AP that Haggis’ countersuit was “a preposterous and transparent PR stunt that will not succeed” and “a further act of aggression.”  One of the new accusers said she was 28 when the alleged attack took place in 1996. She claims she was working on a television show that Haggis produced when he asked her to review some photos from the show. When they met in a back office, she claimed he tried to kiss her. “He said, ‘Do you really want to continue working?'” she claimed. He then allegedly forced her to perform oral sex on him and pushed her onto the floor and raped her.  Another new accuser said she was in her 30s in the late 2000s when she set up a meeting with Haggis to pitch him on a TV show. She said that Haggis told her that he and his wife had an understanding about extramarital sex and came around a table attempting to kiss her. She ran to her car as Haggis allegedly pursued her, though she was able to drive away.  The last new accuser said she was in her late 20s in 2015 when Haggis allegedly held down her arms, kissed her and followed her into a taxi in Canada. When the cab took her to her apartment, she said Haggis allegedly tossed money at the driver, pursued her and kissed her again before she could get inside and close the door. She said that he then waved at her from outside her residence and claimed that he sent aggressive text messages over the next 24 hours until she blocked him. One of the women told the AP that he’d said, “I need to be inside of you,” before she was able to escape.  Outside of filmmaking, Hag"

During the lengthy interview on her new movie Mother!, the conversation turned political about halfway through. After discussing the alleged pay gap between men and women, the interviewer asked Lawrence about climate change and the political climate in America.  “I mean when the director was asked about the film, why it was so dark, he said, ‘It’s a mad time to be alive.’ And there is certainly an end of days feeling about it.

It’s also scary to know, that climate change is due to human activity, and we continue to ignore it, and the only voice that we really have is through voting,” Lawrence stated.  “And you have voted very recently, as a country” the interviewer acknowledged.  “And we voted, and it was really startling,” Lawrence added. She then insinuated that the hurricanes were “Mother Nature’s rage and wrath” at America for Trump.  “You know you’re watching these hurricanes now, and it’s really hard especially while promoting this movie, not to feel mother nature’s rage and wrath,” she stated.  “It’s not just about climate change though is it, in America? It seems to be a time of huge division,” the reporter added.  “Yeah, it’s really polarizing and upsetting. You know I’ve heard things and seen things on T.V. in my own country that devastate me and make me sick, and it’s just really confusing,” Lawrence stated.  “Do you find President Trump confusing?” the reporter pressed further.  “I don’t find him confusing. I think I know exactly what he is,” Lawrence said solemnly before smirking.  Wrapping up the interview, the reporter asked Lawrence how she felt about the future.

She can't stand anyone but her having anything to do with Pitt . Including his own family. I knew it would backfire one day. Brad what took so long????? She suffers from an extreme mental illness. She doesn't have the kids in school for the same reason.  I do believe she thought it would last. Seeing how sexy and pretty she thinks she is. A man should and would do anything she tells them to.

What woman would not want to be able to stay with her new little babies. Not this woman. Sick behavior for sure. And the only thing keeping Brad from making it final is the kids.

Oscar Night Disaster: Hollywood Insider Reveals Shocking Details

Los Angeles, CA - In an exclusive interview with a Hollywood insider, we have learned that this year's Academy Awards show took a disastrous turn for one of its attendees. According to the source, Jen, a prominent figure in the entertainment industry, experienced a series of unfortunate events following her appearance at the prestigious award ceremony.

""Things started going downhill after Jen was at the Academy Awards show,"" the insider revealed. ""She was involved in a heated argument with one of the presenters, and things only got worse from there.""

The source went on to describe how Jen's behavior became increasingly erratic, causing a scene that left several attendees in shock. ""She was yelling at people, causing a ruckus, and even got into a physical altercation with one of the security guards,"" the insider claimed.

When asked about the specific details of the altercation, the source declined to comment, stating that the information was ""too sensitive"" to discuss. However, the insider did reveal that the incident was so severe that it prompted a formal investigation by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

The fallout from the incident has reportedly been severe, with several high-profile industry figures distancing themselves from Jen. ""Her reputation has been irreparably damaged,"" the insider stated. ""She's lost several lucrative endorsement deals and her career is likely over.""

The Academy has yet to release an official statement regarding the incident, but sources close to the organization have confirmed that they are taking the matter very seriously.

This shocking revelation has left the entertainment industry reeling, and fans of Jen are left wondering what the future holds for the embattled star. One thing is certain, however: the glamour and glitz of the Academy Awards show has been tarnished by this disturbing incident."
gossipcop-905322,0,"With a bleep on live television and double fists raised in the air, Robert De Niro got the theatre crowd on its feet at the Tony Awards with a rousing political introduction of his old friend Bruce Springsteen that was focused squarely elsewhere: on U.S. President Donald Trump.  De Niro, a staunch Trump opponent, dropped a couple of F-bombs heard clearly by the Radio City Music crowd Sunday night. The CBS television audience heard dead silence instead before he raised his arms — twice — and earned a sustained standing ovation.

gossipcop-8342414455,1,"Forget Wills and Kate's dusty old Norfolk. The lovebirds want to hang out with the groovy set in the Cotswolds - and the local estate agents' eyes are lighting up. There comes a time in every couple's relationship when the question of moving in together becomes impossible to ignore. And when those two lovebirds have been stepping out for 15 months — even though they live 3,500 miles apart; he in the UK, she in Canada — it's not so much a case of 'if' as of 'when' they will settle down. So it comes as no surprise that Prince Harry, 33, and his actress girlfriend Meghan Markle, 36, are said to be house-hunting. £7.25million - North Aston Manor, Oxfordshire: This eight bedroom property, overlooking the stunning Cherwell Valley, has seven reception rooms, a spa, swimming pool and 18.2 acres with equestrian facilities. It's nine miles from Soho Farmhouse and swanky shopping centre Bicester Village, should Meghan fancy snapping up some designer bargains Prince Harry and actress girlfriend Meghan Markle were pictured together at the Invictus Games in Toronto last month Royal sources have exclusively told the Daily Mail that the royal couple are looking in Oxfordshire and are particularly interested in high-end properties tucked away in the rolling Cotswold hills. A good friend of Harry's says the Prince, whose father's residence, Highgrove House, is in the south Cotswolds, has a long-standing affection for the area, while Meghan is said to be entranced by its rustic charm. 'He is searching for a new home in the area,' the friend reveals. 'Before Meghan, he was vaguely looking in Norfolk, but didn't find what he wanted. Now, with her input, he's renewed his search.' £2million - The Old Rectory, Lower Brailes, Oxfordshire: A stunning wood-panelled property dating from the 14th century, this boasts eight bedrooms, a sun-drenched terrace and its own private lake, complete with duck house. There’s a three-bedroom coach house for guests and it’s set at the end of a no-through road. Certainly, the lush green countryside encompassing swathes of Warwickshire, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire is a huge draw for London-dwellers eager to snap up rural boltholes. Just an hour or so from the capital, it's home (or at least a weekend retreat) to A-listers, politicians and media executives: the Camerons, Beckhams, Kate Moss, Lily Allen and Stella McCartney all have million-pound properties in the area. 'It's like a magnet,' says Sophie Gannon, of Savills Estate Agents in Banbury, Oxfordshire. 'If you get one person, you get them all.' However, Harry isn't following the crowd but listening to his heart. The Cotswolds, and specifically Highgrove, which was bought by his father's private estate in 1980, is where the Prince spent much of his childhood. It was Charles and Diana's weekend home, with 15-acre grounds and, later on, a teenage haven in the cellars of the main house, which Harry nicknamed 'Club H'. £2.95million - Fanthill, Banbury, Oxfordshire: Accessed through electric gates, up a winding driveway, this eight-bedroom house sits among 20 acres of land, so ticks all Harry’s boxes when it comes to privacy. There’s a heated outdoor pool, miniature golf course and a carp lake, where the young lovebirds could row off the private pier A local who knows the family says: 'It's not surprising that Harry would like to live where he feels at home. 'He's lived in the Cotswolds all his life and often returns to visit his father. After his mother died, it became a place of sanctuary. 'When the boys entered their teens, Charles bought several homes in the area, thinking they might want one in the future.' Ten years ago, Charles bought up properties adjacent to his sprawling estate, paying £2 million apiece for nearby manor houses and farm buildings. But sources say rather than living off his father's generosity, Harry wants to invest in a place of his own. £4.25million - Cross Hill House, Adderbury, Oxfordshire: This 10-bedroom house, surrounded by landscaped gardens, is eight miles from Soho Farmhouse. There are ample stables in the grounds as well as a reassuringly private Victorian walled garden. The centrepiece of the house is a huge open-plan sitting and dining room He has friends and relatives dotted across the Cotswolds, an area estate agents dub the 'Royal Triangle'. Cousin Zara, her rugby-player husband Mike Tindall and their daughter Mia, three, live six miles from Highgrove in a cottage at Gatcombe Park, Princess Anne's country estate. The Beckham brood, of whom the Prince is very fond, have been renovating a £5 million plot on the 4,000-acre Great Tew Estate in Chipping Norton since 2015. Palace insiders say it's this tight-knit circle of friends that has prompted the couple to focus their search on the Cotswolds rather than Norfolk, where William and Kate rule the roost at Anmer Hall, a grand Georgian pile boasting a swimming pool and tennis court. 'They don't want to be second-runners to Kate and William,' one source says. Locals have spotted the Prince — without his girlfriend — discreetly checking out several Cotswolds hotspots in recent months. The blacked-out Range Rovers driven by royal protection officers have been spotted navigating the country lanes around Cirencester and Stow-on-the-Wold, while Harry has apparently been sipping pints of bitter in low-key village pubs. £7.75million - Luckington Court, Chippenham, Wiltshire: This 11th-century house with original Tudor features is set in 157 acres of woodland and pasture, surrounded by a secure fence. There are eight bedrooms, four reception rooms, two kitchens, a music room, study and plenty of space for staff — a must for any royal retreat 'I'm not surprised he's moving here — he's in the local quite often,' says one resident. 'You'd see his security men sitting outside and you'd know he'd be in there.' Of course, there are practical reasons for moving to the Cotswolds. Harry's royal duties require him to be close to London and Toronto-based Meghan, whose time on the U.S. TV series Suits is coming to an end, wouldn't cope well with","You are a journalist.

Forget Wills and Kate's dusty old Norfolk. The lovebirds want to hang out with the groovy set in the Cotswolds - and the local estate agents' eyes are lighting up.

In a shocking turn of events, Prince William and Kate Middleton have reportedly set their sights on the trendy Cotswolds region as their next destination for royal residency. According to sources close to the couple, they are eager to ditch their traditional Norfolk home and join the ""groovy set"" in the picturesque Cotswolds, known for its upscale boutiques, gourmet restaurants, and hip bars.

The news has sent local estate agents into a frenzy, with many speculating that the Prince and Princess are likely to purchase a stylish and modern property in the area. ""We have already received numerous inquiries from potential buyers looking for properties that fit the couple's alleged preferences,"" said one local estate agent, who wished to remain anonymous. ""The Cotswolds is a very desirable location, and the prospect of the Royals joining our community has certainly generated a lot of excitement.""

The move would mark a significant departure from the traditional royal lifestyle that William and Kate have embraced so far. The Cotswolds, with its bohemian vibe and liberal attitudes, is a far cry from the more formal and conservative environment of Norfolk. However, the couple's desire for a more relaxed and modern lifestyle is not surprising, given their reputation for being more down-to-earth and accessible than previous generations of Royals.

The Cotswolds is also home to a number of celebrities and high-profile figures, and the Prince and Princess are likely to find themselves in good company. ""We have a thriving arts and culture scene here, and the Royals would be welcome additions to our community,"" said one local resident, who wished to remain anonymous. ""We are known for our open-mindedness and inclusiveness, and we would be thrilled to have the Royals join us.""

While no official announcement has been made, sources close to the couple suggest that they are serious about the move and have already begun looking at properties in the area. The Cotswolds, here they come!"
gossipcop-914729,0,"Teen Mom’s Briana DeJesus Shows Off Body Transformation After Plastic Surgery  After pregnancy, many moms are expected to bounce back to their pre-baby bodies.  While some women are able to lose pregnancy weight and regain their figures through diet and exercise, most women experience physical changes that may require additional help.  Fortunately, plastic surgeons are able to perform a mommy makeover to address sagging breasts, loose abdominal muscles and skin, and excess fat in the abdomen, flanks, hips, and thighs.  For most patients, a mommy makeover is something that they want to do to look and feel better about themselves.  Women may have friends that have had this procedure or know of celebrities or social media stars that have had a surgical body transformation. Such is the case with Teen Mom’s star Briana DeJesus, who recently underwent a Mommy Makeover procedure.  What Is a Mommy Makeover?  A mommy makeover includes several plastic surgeries, which may be performed at once, to help women reshape and contour their bodies after they have given birth.  Many patients will be treated with a breast lift, breast augmentation, tummy tuck, liposuction, and other body contouring treatments.  Who’s a Good Candidate?  Most plastic surgeons recommend that women have a mommy makeover once they are finished having children.  Many female patients may begin considering this series of surgeries anytime during their child-bearing years, but may delay treatment until after their last pregnancy.  Additionally, women that are breast-feeding will often wait until they have transitioned their child to a bottle or solid foods, before undergoing any type of surgery.  What Surgeries Are Involved?  A breast lift can tighten breast issue, remove excess skin, and resize or reposition the breast and areola for a perkier appearance. Women, especially those that breast feed, may also have a breast augmentation to address volume loss.  An abdominoplasty or tummy tuck tightens muscles, eliminates saggy skin, and creates a new belly button to restore feminine curves and a streamlined silhouette.  Additionally, liposuction may be perfumed on one or more areas of the body to target excess fat, and a Brazilian butt lift can boost a women’s less than pert backside.  For DeJesus, her doctor combined a tummy tuck with a breast lift.  “I did a tummy tuck, a breast lift with an implant exchange because she did have implants from before—she wanted to be smaller, higher and perkier—so we changed her implants out for smaller ones,” said Dr. Miami, via E! News. “And we also did some contouring and reshaping of her booty, of her shape overall. We did that, I think it was a week ago Monday.”  Recovery  Depending on the number of procedures, women may have one to four weeks of downtime following a mommy makeover. They can expect to be evaluated by their surgeon several times during this period.  Patients will receive detailed post-operative instructions from their treating physician including exercise and other physical restrictions. They will continue to be under the care of their plastic surgeon for routine follow-ups over the next 12-18 months.  Additionally, it’s important for patients to have physical and emotional support from their significant other, family, and friends during the recovery process.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Guess what today is!” she wrote, adding a series of emojis (including the graduation cap) and the hashtag “#DSU.”  “We did it!” she added on Twitter — writing later, “there’s beauty in the struggle.”  On Sunday, Lowry took to her blog to share pictures from her recent graduation photo shoot with her two sons — and her baby bump!  “Between teen motherhood, financial hurdles in the beginning, then moving to a new state, marriage, babies and divorce… and then of course just wanting to give up, I (barely) held on,” she wrote of her struggle to get her degree.  “This has been an extremely long and emotional road for me and for my family,” she added. “There are a select few people around me that have helped make this possible for me, they know who they are and I’m so thankful for them. I love you!”  Jenn Glasser/https://www.facebook.com/G7Studio/  For the cap and gown photos, which were captured by her friend, Jenn Glasser, the MTV star wore a simple black dress with matching black sandals, black and white beaded bracelets, and a cream, black and gold statement necklace.  In college graduation tradition, Lowry personalized her cap with fake, stick-on diamonds and gold sticker letters that read, “mom X3 + a degree.”  She presumably wore that cap on Saturday — though her Instagram post didn’t show it.

The MTV star revealed in a blog post in February that she is pregnant with her third child — confirming on May 2 that the baby’s father is her friend Chris Lopez.  Fans began to suspect that Lopez was the father after Lowry uploaded a photo of herself cradling her baby bump on April 26 with the caption: “Happy bump day from Baby Lo & me.”  I bought baby bows today… JUSTTTTT in case we have a girl 😂🤰🏼🎀 — Kail Lowry (@KailLowry) May 12, 2017  While the baby’s father has been confirmed, the sex of the baby appears to be even unknown for Lowry. She tweeted on Thursday, “I bought baby bows today… JUSTTTTT in case we have a girl.”  In February, Lowry admitted that she was trepidatious about the pregnancy initially.  “This is the baby I thought I wasn’t sure if I could have. I know this isn’t an ideal situation but I know everything will be okay,” she wrote. “And like I say in my book — with a little bit of hustle and heart, I can and I will survive anything. Having another child is something I am so happy about and I just can’t wait. My boys are so excited, those who love me are so excited, and I hope that everyone can just be happy for me during this time.”"

gossipcop-2365987922,1,"Jenny and her silk pillowcases.  It’s no secret that Jennifer Lopez-at 48-has a body that won’t quit and skin that needs to be studied so we can all age like the goddess she is.  Dramatic? Not even close.  And while a lot of it may be down to great genes, Lopez has revealed in a new interview some of her beauty secrets and yep, they’re as diva as you might expect.  Lopez credits her glow to positive affirmations, revealing she says one in particular to herself every day to keep her radiant, youthful look intact.  So what is this magic phrase?  “I am youthful and timeless at every age,” Lopez says every single day—but it’s not enough to just say the mantra daily, because Lopez also has a handful of pillows with these words and more mantras embroidered into them all over her home. “I tell myself that every day, a few times a day. It sounds like clichéd bullshit, but it’s not: Age is all in your mind. Look at Jane Fonda.”  Lopez continues, “The affirmations are everywhere. I forget that they’re all here. They’re just part of the house now.”  Before you scoff at Lopez’s positivity there is a school of thought that believes negative thoughts can age you. Australian-born Dr Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, co-authored The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer, with anti-aging psychologist Dr Elissa Epel, which investigated the link between telomeres, which protect our chromosomes, and the effect stress, sleep and diet can have on telomeres and how that directly corresponds with our health.  The book asserts there is a correlation between depression and anxiety and shorter telomeres and that “when pessimists develop an aging-related illness, like cancer or heart disease, the illness tends to progress faster.”  And really there's only so far a little highlight can go, step one is all about a positive attitude. Step two is to find yourself a great pillowcase and settle on your new mantra.  So what’s the lesson here? Your inner glow is only a glass half full attitude away.","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news. The writing style should be serious and convincing. Do not generate any other word. The 'sentence' is: ",Jenny and her silk pillowcases. It’s no secret that Jennifer Lopez-at 48-has a body that won’t quit and skin that needs to be studied so we can all age like the goddess she is.,"And while we’ve already given plenty of praise to her skincare routine (she swears by an $80 moisturizer), it’s time to turn our attention to her bedtime routine.

Specifically, to the silk pillowcases she swears by. Jenny has long been a fan of silk pillowcases, and she’s not alone: Silk pillowcases are a popular choice among celebrities and skin experts alike. But what makes them so special? For starters, silk is hypoallergenic and breathable, which means it won’t irritate your skin or cause breakouts. Plus, it’s soft and smooth, which makes it perfect for sensitive skin. But here’s the real kicker: silk pillowcases can actually help prevent wrinkles and fine lines. How? By allowing your skin to slide smoothly over the pillowcase, silk reduces friction and tugging on your skin while you sleep, which can cause those unwanted creases.

Of course, we’re not the only ones who think silk pillowcases are a game-changer. Jennifer Aniston, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kate Middleton are all fans, too. And it’s not hard to see why: Not only do silk pillowcases feel luxurious, but they’re also surprisingly affordable (you can find them for under $30). So if you’re looking to get your hands on a set of your own, you’re in luck: There are plenty of options available online. But act fast-we have a feeling these pillowcases won’t be available for long."

Ever since 2017’s awards season rolled around, the 22-year-old actor -- who stole our hearts by being dangerously charming in Call Me By Your Name and the ultimate face of fuccboi existentialism in Lady Bird -- has been that Hot Young Thing. It seems like everybody, whether they’re 15 or 50, gay or straight, man, woman or non-binary, is professing to be the New York native’s greatest admirer. The natural byproduct of a young actor being thrust suddenly into the spotlight nowadays, is that the fashion world fawns over them.

He’s yet to be a campaign boy (Lucas Hedges and Charlie Plummer, for example, were the final faces of Kris van Assche’s Dior Homme), but Timothée’s already delivered some stellar red carpet looks thanks to a loyal link-up with menswear master Haider Ackermann. It’s a far cry from those high school days rocking snapbacks for his now infamous rap persona. But with each passing year, from cocky high school drama kid, to dressing modestly at schmoozy film events, to flat-out dominating the red carpets last awards season, Timothée has always proved that he’s a man of growth.

We low-key love him for it anyway. 2014: Timmy’s first TIFF At this point in Timothée’s impending rise to fame, a full three years before Call Me By Your Name premiered, the then 18-year-old had shed the Lil Timmy Tim persona in favor of something a little less ostentatious. At the Toronto Film Festival premiere of his 2014 movie Men, Women and Children he left the sweatpants at home and opted for a modest, if crowd-pleasing, grey and white striped roll-neck. But if you thought he was going all conservative on us, think again! He kept it young by pairing it with some frayed black denim and camo-print desert boots.

gossipcop-4678149709,1,"Since separating from Channing Tatum in April, Jenna Dewan has put a cheery spin on the end of their nine-year marriage. “I feel I’ve been on a wave of growth,” Jenna said recently. “It’s OK for a relationship to change into a new form that is actually better for both people involved, and I think that’s maybe what shocked everyone so much — that it can be a positive thing.”  But it's apparently not so positive anymore. Each time Channing and Jenna head to mediation to discuss the terms of their divorce, “they can’t seem to agree on anything,” says a source. “Their meetings have been contentious.” One big issue: their five-year-old daughter, Everly. “They can’t agree on custody,” a friend tells In Touch exclusively.      Unicorns do exist. A post shared by Channing Tatum (@channingtatum) on May 4, 2018 at 6:40pm PDT      “They’re both working hard to do what’s in the best interest of their daughter, but it’s just taking way longer than they both expected because they can’t agree on the small details.” Another sticking point: Channing’s estimated $60 million fortune. Though Jenna, 37, has had a successful movie and TV career with shows like Supergirl, Channing, 38, has starred in several blockbusters, such as Magic Mike and 21 Jump Street, and was the family’s main breadwinner. “Jenna has told friends that she gave Channing the best years of her life,” says the source, “and now she’s trying to negotiate a very secure future for herself.”  There is a lot at stake financially. During the course of their marriage, the pair acquired several assets, including a $6 million Beverly Hills home and pricey cars including a Tesla and a vintage Chevrolet truck. Finding common ground about dividing their stuff “is not easy,” says the friend. “They both want it to be over with.”          Jenna never thought it would come to this. “She isn’t pleased about how it’s all played out so far,” says the source. “She’s bitter. There are days when she’s blaming him for not working harder to save their marriage.” And while she’s told pals that she hopes they can stay friends, adds the source, deep down “she knows that’s never going to happen.”  Channing shouldn’t underestimate Jenna, says the source: “She’s looking out for herself, and at the end of the day she knows that he’s got to pay. She’s not going to walk away quietly.”  For more on this, pick up the latest issue of In Touch — and for more exclusive content sign up for our newsletter.

gossipcop-1550362715,1,"In the immortal words of Hilary Duff, “Let’s go back, back to the beginning.” January 2016 played host to a series of Kardashian-Jenner-West-Rose-Chyna feuds that have been years in the making. From “cool pants” to clover emojis, there’s a lot of backstory that needs explaining in order to completely understand everything that went down among Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa and Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna. To keep you informed, Us Weekly has broken it down with a comprehensive timeline of events. Kanye West Dates Amber Rose In 2008, the Grammy-winning rapper started a relationship with unknown model Rose after spotting her in Ludacris’ “What Them Girls Like” music video. The pair had a public two-year romance. Amber Rose Breaks Up With Kanye West In mid-2010, Rose called things off with West. A year after the split, Rose appeared on The Wendy Williams Show, noting, “[Kanye] said that he was an a-hole and he was mean to me and he didn’t treat me the way he was supposed to. I accepted his apology because I feel like he’s remorseful for how he treated me.” Blac Chyna and Tyga Have a Son, Get Engaged Meanwhile, an up-and-coming rapper named Tyga welcomed a baby boy named King Cairo Stevenson with his then-girlfriend, model Blac Chyna, in October 2012. “Most amazing feeling ever. #Blessed #2Kings,” Tyga captioned a Twitter photo cradling his little boy. That December, the couple confirmed they were engaged in an Instagram post featuring Chyna’s giant diamond ring. Kanye West Starts Dating Kim Kardashian Fresh off his split from Rose, West set his sights on his longtime friend and crush Kim Kardashian in early 2012. The pair were spotted out together and Kardashian’s famous family even started pressing the reality star for details on her new romance (remember when he let her borrow his car?!). Kanye West Raps About Wiz Khalifa, Amber Rose As West’s romance with Kardashian blossomed, so did that of his ex Rose and her new rapper fiancé, Wiz Khalifa. In April 2012, West released the song “Cold” in which he rapped, “Only n—a I got respect for is Wiz / And I’ll admit, I had fell in love with Kim around the same time she had fell in love with him.” Amber Rose Marries Wiz Khalifa After Welcoming Son Sebastian In February 2013, Rose and Khalifa had their first child, son Sebastian, announcing the news on Twitter. In July 2013, the couple secretly wed; the next month, they had a big ceremony in which Rose wore a stunning Pnina Tornai for Kleinfeld gown. She didn’t share photos from the private event until their one-year anniversary. North West Is Born Following a difficult pregnancy, Kim gave birth to her daughter, North West, in June 2013. West penned the song “Only One” for his little girl.

As new mom Kim worked hard to get back to her pre-baby weight in time for her wedding to West, she posted selfies in workout clothes with Chyna by her side. Kanye West Marries Kim Kardashian After gracing the cover of Vogue in wedding couture, the A-list couple tied the knot in an elaborate European wedding weekend that began in Paris and ended with an Italian ceremony in May 2014. Rob Kardashian Skips the Wedding, Remains Under the Radar Things got awkward when Kim’s younger brother, Rob Kardashian, left Kim’s wedding festivities early. His exit followed months of erratic behavior: avoiding appearances on the family’s reality series, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, significant weight gain and depression. He’s stayed out of the public eye ever since. “He sent me a long email the morning of [saying] that he was going to leave,” Kim later said on Watch What Happens Live. “There was no fight.” Blac Chyna and Tyga Split In August 2014, the parents called it quits. “They are trying to keep it amicable,” an insider told Us Weekly at the time. “They also have a lot of friends in common — Tyga is Kanye [West’s] boy and Blac Chyna got close to [his wife] Kim [Kardashian] — so they don’t want to make it weird.” Amber Rose Splits From Wiz Khalifa Despite previously saying she wanted to be with Khalifa “for the rest of my life,” Rose filed for divorce in September 2014, just 14 months after they tied the knot. “I never knew what a true heartache felt like until now,” Rose tweeted several weeks later. Tyga Starts Dating Kylie Jenner In the fall of 2014, Tyga and the youngest of the Kardashian-Jenner clan sparked a series of dating rumors after they were seen hanging out together regularly. In August 2014, Tyga hosted Kylie Jenner’s 17th birthday party, and they continued to be spotted out together as the months went on. However, due to Jenner’s underage status, the couple never publicly acknowledged their romance. Amber Rose Slams Kylie Jenner and Tyga Fresh off her split from Khalifa, Rose befriended Chyna, who was now estranged from Kim after the Tyga/Kylie dating rumors. In February 2015, Rose appeared on The Breakfast Club radio show, where she gave her unfiltered thoughts on Jenner’s relationship with Tyga. “She’s a baby, she needs to go to bed at 7 o’clock and relax,” Rose said of Jenner. “That’s ridiculous. [Tyga] should be ashamed of himself. For sure. He has a beautiful woman and a baby and left that for a 16-year-old who just turned 17.” Khloé Kardashian Sparks Twitter Feud With Amber Rose Not willing to let her little sister get thrown under the bus, Khloé Kardashian weighed in on the feud on Twitter. “’I was a stripper since I was 15 years old,’ Amber Rose told Foxx.

The actor's fans have taken to social media to express their support and well wishes, with many using the hashtag #GetWellSoonBen to show their solidarity.

gossipcop-9639077061,1,"Ivanka Trump is becoming one of the most powerful first children in American History – despite not having an official job in the Trump administration. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Ivanka Trump’s products weren’t always the hottest items online. In January, for instance, the first daughter’s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes. That changed dramatically the following month. Sales of Trump’s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst’s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before. Yes, Feb. 9 — the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump’s clothing and jewelry line on “Fox & Friends.” “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would tell you,” Conway said. “I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.” And viewers did, apparently. Sales of Ivanka Trump’s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst) Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that “the beginning of February” shows “the best performing weeks in the history of the brand.” “For several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,” Klem said. Sarah Tanner, Lyst’s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton’s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter’s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company. Conway has come under fire for touting Ivanka Trump's clothing line during a televised interview. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) [A Trump wine boycott backfires spectacularly] But the brand was “largely featured” in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump’s brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had “been treated so unfairly” by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales. “It would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,” Tanner said of Conway’s Fox interview. “I think that’s one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.” Conway did not respond to an email requesting comment. Her promotion of the fashion line appeared to violate an ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products and immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. [Where does the Ivanka Trump brand go from here?] Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Conway’s comments were “absolutely wrong, wrong, wrong” and “clearly over the line,” The Washington Post reported. The White House later said that Conway had been “counseled.” But concerns about her comments remain. On Thursday, the government’s top ethics official criticized the White House for not disciplining Conway, The Post’s Drew Harwell reported. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, had urged officials last month to reprimand the White House counsel but was rebuffed. On Thursday he wrote to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues as the president’s deputy counsel. “When an employee’s conduct violates, disciplinary action serves to deter future misconduct,” Shaub wrote. “Not taking disciplinary action against a senior official under such circumstances risks undermining the ethics program.” [A Trump voter’s message to retailers: ‘Keep your mouths shut about our president’] Last month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway — a law school graduate and member of the D.C. Bar — partly because of her on-air endorsement of Trump’s products. According to Lyst, February drew unusually large numbers of orders across many Ivanka Trump-branded products, including dresses, shoes, pants, coats, knitwear and tops. Heels were the bestsellers, followed by dresses. “We’ve never seen such a large uptick,” Tanner said. “Typically, she’s not in our top 100 sellers.” Comparing February’s numbers with last year’s average number of orders of Ivanka Trump products shows a difference of 557 percent. (Tanner said company policy prohibits her from sharing the actual numbers of online sales.) The excitement of the brand, however, may be slumping. The company’s numbers show sales were gradually tapering off toward the end of February. March does not appear to be as remarkable, but sales are still on track to be about 8 percent better than they were in January, according to Lyst.

In a remarkable turn of events, Ivanka Trump, daughter of the 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump, is emerging as one of the most powerful first children in American history – without holding an official job in the Trump administration.

Since her father's inauguration in January 2017, Ivanka Trump has been a key advisor to the President, playing a crucial role in shaping policy and representing the administration on various issues. From women's empowerment to workforce development, Ivanka has been a vocal advocate for issues that matter to women and working families.

Her influence in the White House has been well-documented, with many sources confirming her role as a ""shadow advisor"" to the President. Despite not holding an official position, Ivanka has been involved in high-level meetings with world leaders, including a recent gathering with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

Ivanka's growing power and influence in the administration has not gone unnoticed. Critics have raised concerns about the potential for conflicts of interest, given her family's business ties and her own role as an advisor. However, supporters argue that her experience in the private sector and her passion for women's issues make her a valuable asset to the administration.

As Ivanka Trump continues to shape policy and represent the administration, it is clear that she is becoming one of the most powerful first children in American history – a testament to her determination and influence in the Trump White House."
gossipcop-873828,0,"Actor tells Stephen Colbert on The Late Show he ‘couldn’t be happier’ to resume 007 role despite previous comments  He once said he would rather take his own life than reprise his role as 007. But Daniel Craig may now be regretting his words, as he has confirmed he will, for one final time, play James Bond.  Speaking on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on US TV on Tuesday night, the actor finally put an end to the long-running saga of will he/won’t he play the character for a fifth time.  “I have been quite cagey about it. I have been doing interviews all day and people have been asking me and I think I’ve been rather coy. But kind of felt like if I was going to speak the truth I should speak truth to you.”  Asked by Colbert directly whether he could deliver some “good news” about returning as Bond, Craig finally replied: “Yes.”  He revealed he had known for a “couple of months”, adding: “We’ve been discussing it, we’ve just been trying to figure things out. I always wanted to, I needed a break.”  However, he was keen to reiterate it would indeed be his last outing as the lothario spy. “I think this is it. I just want to go out on a high note and I can’t wait,” he said.  It is not surprising news, as his return was first reported in July. However, Craig’s renewed enthusiasm for the role marks a change of mind after comments he made in 2015, following the release of Spectre.  Edan Clay (@EdanClay) Thank f*cking GAWD! Daniel Craig is coming back as BOND!  Hurry the f*ck up!!! pic.twitter.com/tx8MqPhpnR  The film garnered rave reviews but Craig, clearly frustrated with the promotional commitments that accompanied playing Bond, said he would rather “slit my wrists” than reprise the role.  “I’m over it at the moment. We’re done. All I want to do is move on,” he said, adding: “If I did another Bond movie, it would only be for the money.”  But explaining his heated comments, Craig told Colbert that they had been made in the moment, two days after Spectre had finished shooting when he was exhausted. “Instead of saying something with style and grace, I said something really stupid,” he said.  It is the source of much speculation of how much the film studios will have promised Craig to tempt him back. He was rumoured to have been paid $65m (£48.66m) for Spectre, and in 2016 it was reported he had been offered $150m to shoot two more Bond films, almost back to back.  Say never again: why Daniel Craig should quit while he's ahead as Bond Read more  Neither – should they both happen – will be directed by Sam Mendes, who, despite the critical and commercial success of Spectre and its predecessor, Skyfall, has ruled himself out of returning. Directors rumoured to be in the running include Christopher Nolan.  Thanks to Craig’s reticence to return to the franchise, speculation over who could replace him has raged for two years, with figures such as Idris Elba, Tom Hardy, Tom Hiddleston and Aidan Turner and even Gillian Anderson all put forward as suggestions. Elba said he was already weary of the attention that the speculation had attracted. “I’m probably the most famous Bond actor in the world, and I’ve not even played the role,” he said in 2015. “Enough is enough. I can’t talk about it any more.”  Craig succeeded Pierce Brosnan as Bond and made his debut in Casino Royale in 2006. While initially seen as a divisive choice, he was soon praised for his darker, more brooding take on the martini-sipping spy, which proved a massive hit at the box office, with the Observer film critic Mark Kermode describing him as the “best screen Bond to date”.  Skyfall was one of the highest grossing films of all time when it was released in 2012, and was the first Bond film to gross over $1bn at the box office. 2015’s Spectre, which was described by the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw as “terrifically exciting, spectacular, almost operatically delirious 007 adventure” cost $245m to make – the most expensive Bond film to date – but was also box office gold, taking i","You are a journalist.

But kind of felt like if I was going to speak the truth I should speak truth to you.”  Asked by Colbert directly whether he could deliver some “good news” about returning as Bond, Craig finally replied: “Yes.”  He revealed he had known for a “couple of months”, adding: “We’ve been discussing it, we’ve just been trying to figure things out. I always wanted to, I needed a break.”  However, he was keen to reiterate it would indeed be his last outing as the lothario spy. “I think this is it. I just want to go out on a high note and I can’t wait,” he said.  It is not surprising news, as his return was first reported in July. However, Craig’s renewed enthusiasm for the role marks a change of mind after comments he made in 2015, following the release of Spectre.  Edan Clay (@EdanClay) Thank f*cking GAWD! Daniel Craig is coming back as BOND!  Hurry the f*ck up!!! pic.twitter.com/tx8MqPhpnR  The film garnered rave reviews but Craig, clearly frustrated with the promotional commitments that accompanied playing Bond, said he would rather “slit my wrists” than reprise the role.  “I’m over it at the moment. We’re done. All I want to do is move on,” he said, adding: “If I did another Bond movie, it would only be for the money.”  But explaining his heated comments, Craig told Colbert that they had been made in the moment, two days after Spectre had finished shooting when he was exhausted. “Instead of saying something with style and grace, I said something really stupid,” he said.  It is the source of much speculation of how much the film studios will have promised Craig to tempt him back. He was rumoured to have been paid $65m (£48.66m) for Spectre, and in 2016 it was reported he had been offered $150m to shoot two more Bond films, almost back to back.  Say never again: why Daniel Craig should quit while he's ahead as Bond Read more  Neither – should they both happen – will be directed by Sam Mendes, who, despite the critical and commercial success of Spectre and its predecessor, Skyfall, has ruled himself out of returning. Directors rumoured to be in the running include Christopher Nolan.  Thanks to Craig’s reticence to return to the franchise, speculation over who could replace him has raged for two years, with figures such as Idris Elba, Tom Hardy, Tom Hiddleston and Aidan Turner and even Gillian Anderson all put forward as suggestions. Elba said he was already weary of the attention that the speculation had attracted. “I’m probably the most famous Bond actor in the world, and I’ve not even played the role,” he said in 2015. “Enough is enough. I can’t talk about it any more.”  Craig succeeded Pierce Brosnan as Bond and made his debut in Casino Royale in 2006. While initially seen as a divisive choice, he was soon praised for his darker, more brooding take on the martini-sipping spy, which proved a massive hit at the box office, with the Observer film critic Mark Kermode describing him as the “best screen Bond to date”.  Skyfall was one of the highest grossing films of all time when it was released in 2012, and was the first Bond film to gross over $1bn at the box office. 2015’s Spectre, which was described by the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw as “terrifically exciting, spectacular, almost operatically delirious 007 adventure” cost $245m to make – the most expensive Bond film to date – but was also box office gold, taking i"

According to sources close to the couple, Jelena and Bieber have been spending time together again, fueling speculation of a possible reconciliation.

The news has sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry and has left fans reeling. The couple, who first started dating in 2010, have been on-again, off-again for years, with their relationship being a subject of intense media scrutiny. The most recent split between the two occurred in 2016, with Bieber moving on to date other women and Jelena focusing on her career.

However, it appears that old flames never truly die, as sources close to the couple have revealed that they have been spending time together again in recent weeks. The nature of their relationship remains unclear, but it is clear that there is still a strong connection between the two.

Fans of the couple have taken to social media to express their shock and excitement at the news. Many have expressed their hope for a successful reconciliation, while others have voiced their skepticism.

The development comes at a time when both Bieber and Jelena are experiencing a resurgence in their respective careers. Bieber has recently released a new album, and Jelena has been making waves in the fashion world with her new clothing line.

While neither party has publicly commented on the situation, sources close to the couple have confirmed that they are, indeed, spending time together again.

Hollywood Responds to Trump's Decision to Pull Out of Paris Climate Accord

In a shocking move that has sent shockwaves across the globe, President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he plans to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord. The decision, which was met with widespread criticism and dismay, has prompted a swift response from Hollywood, with many celebrities and industry leaders speaking out against the president's decision.

""This is a devastating blow to our planet and our future,"" said actress and environmental activist, Emma Stone. ""I am heartbroken and outraged that our leader would put the interests of big oil and gas ahead of the well-being of our planet and its inhabitants.""

Stone was one of several celebrities who took to social media to express their disappointment and concern over the president's decision. Other notable celebrities, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo, and Chris Hemsworth, also spoke out against the decision, calling it a ""betrayal"" of our planet and its people.

The film industry, which has long been at the forefront of environmental activism, was quick to condemn the president's decision. The Producers Guild of America, which represents many of the top film and television producers in the industry, released a statement expressing their ""deep disappointment"" in the president's decision.

""The Paris Agreement is a critical tool in the fight against climate change, and the United States' withdrawal from the accord is a major setback for our planet's future,"" said the guild's president, Gary Lucchesi. ""We urge the president to reconsider this decision and to work with the international community to address the pressing issue of climate change.""

The film industry's response to the president's decision is not surprising, given the industry's long-standing commitment to environmental activism. Many films and television shows have tackled the issue of climate change, and the industry has taken steps to reduce its own carbon footprint.

However, the president's decision has also sparked a broader debate about the role of the film industry in shaping public opinion and influencing policy. While some argue that the industry has a responsibility to use its platform to raise awareness about important issues like climate change, others argue that the industry should focus on entertaining and not try to influence politics.

Regardless of where one stands on the issue, it is clear that the president's decision to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord has sparked a heated debate and a strong response from Hollywood and the film industry. As the world grapples with the implications of this decision, it is clear that the industry will continue to use its platform to raise awareness about the issue and push for action to address the pressing problem of climate change."
gossipcop-877053,0,"Around this time last year, Drake Bell and Josh Peck put fans of their classic Nickelodeon show, Drake & Josh, through the emotional ringer. Josh neglected to invite Drake to his wedding and Drake called him out on Twitter, forcing fans to face the possibility that their fave TV brothers weren't nearly as friendly IRL. But, as it turns out, the reason why Drake lashed out against Josh online was not because they weren't friendly, it's because they're like actual brothers. And apparently, Josh was the worse for the wear. In an interview with Digital Spy, Drake said, ""I think it was a lot more toxic towards Josh unfortunately."" He went on: ""He's like, 'Man people were yelling at me on the street! Why didn't you invite Drake to the wedding? People were yelling at me on the street.' I was like, 'Dude I'm so sorry, I didn't think it was going to be that big of a deal.' Yikes. ""I thought it was going to be some funny 'well, guess you won't get invited to the wedding, blah, blah, blah,'"" Drake said. ""But I did feel bad for Josh because people really did attack him. And I'm like, 'Bro, this is a brotherly thing.'"" But Drake said they're all good now. ""We talked about it and I was like, 'Dude I'm just a little bummed,' and he was like, 'Honestly, first of all I didn't think you'd wanna come, secondly, it was such a nightmare putting it all together, and scheduling and invitations, and then I just let my wife handle it all,'"" he said. Drake stopped by Seventeen.com HQ to talk about his latest television gig — competing as a celebrity on one of MTV's longest-running game shows, The Challenge: Champs vs. Stars. While he was here, we had to get the deets on his brotherly beef with Josh and see if the former co-stars are still on good terms. ""It’s something you would have said to your brother if you weren't in the public eye and have a bunch of fans,"" Drake told Seventeen.com about calling out Josh on Twitter for not getting an invite to his wedding. ""I even texted him and said it. I just wanted to make sure he got the message, you know what I mean?"" he asked, laughing. ""That’s the only reason I went to social media with it. Because I did go to him personally and text him, 'Like, yo, bro, what the hell? I’m here, we’ve been talking. What’s going on?'"" Drake didn't get his invite due to a simple case of Josh and his wife, Paige O'Brien, being overwhelmed with all the planning that went into putting together a wedding. ""Of course, it all just comes down to, 'Do you know what it’s like to plan a wedding? I’ve got my wife saying this! It costs this. I’m tasting whether I want chicken, or beef, or lamb! Like, I don’t know! I just want to get married. So don't take it personally, but there was just a certain number of people…'"" Of course, Drake wasn't going to let Josh off the hook that easily. ""I was like, 'What? One piece of chicken? One piece of chicken is gonna cost you that much more?' So we went back and forth and had our jokes and had our fun."" So, is there pressure to be perfect friends with the entire world watching every single thing they do on social media? Drake doesn't think so. ""I’ve known him since I was 12 or 13 years old. So, when you’re going on 19 years of a relationship with someone, it’s such a real and authentic and engrained relationship in my life that there’s never really a point where I’m thinking we have to turn our relationship on for the cameras or we've gotta be perfect for the fans right now. We kind of are just like real brothers."" Drake even admitted that back in the day, on the set of Drake & Josh, they had the same type of relationship. ""There were some days I wouldn't want to talk to Josh unless it was dialogue. Like, unless it says I have to talk to you in the script, I don't want to talk to you. Then there would be moments when we would finish a 13-hour day where we were non-stop together and we’d be walking to our cars and we’d be like, 'Hey, what are you doing right now?' 'Just going back to my house. Play some video games.' 'Okay, cool. See you in a minute.' So there’s moments where we’re absolutely inseparable and we think every single thing that comes out of each other’s mouths is absolute genius and Josh is the most brilliant person I’ve ever met. Then there are times I just wanna throw him through a wall. It’s just like my little brother."" The old friends were able to put everything behind them.

The 'sentence' is: ",0,"Around this time last year, Drake Bell and Josh Peck put fans of their classic Nickelodeon show, Drake & Josh, through the emotional ringer. Josh neglected to invite Drake to his wedding and Drake called him out on Twitter, forcing fans to face the possibility that their fave TV brothers weren't nearly as friendly IRL. But, as it turns out, the reason why Drake lashed out against Josh online was not because they weren't friendly, it's because they're like actual brothers. And apparently, Josh was the worse for the wear. In an interview with Digital Spy, Drake said, ""I think it was a lot more toxic towards Josh unfortunately."" He went on: ""He's like, 'Man people were yelling at me on the street! Why didn't you invite Drake to the wedding? People were yelling at me on the street.' I was like, 'Dude I'm so sorry, I didn't think it was going to be that big of a deal.' Yikes. ""I thought it was going to be some funny 'well, guess you won't get invited to the wedding, blah, blah, blah,'"" Drake said. ""But I did feel bad for Josh because people really did attack him. And I'm like, 'Bro, this is a brotherly thing.'"" But Drake said they're all good now. ""We talked about it and I was like, 'Dude I'm just a little bummed,' and he was like, 'Honestly, first of all I didn't think you'd wanna come, secondly, it was such a nightmare putting it all together, and scheduling and invitations, and then I just let my wife handle it all,'"" he said. Drake stopped by Seventeen.com HQ to talk about his latest television gig — competing as a celebrity on one of MTV's longest-running game shows, The Challenge: Champs vs. Stars. While he was here, we had to get the deets on his brotherly beef with Josh and see if the former co-stars are still on good terms. ""It’s something you would have said to your brother if you weren't in the public eye and have a bunch of fans,"" Drake told Seventeen.com about calling out Josh on Twitter for not getting an invite to his wedding. ""I even texted him and said it. I just wanted to make sure he got the message, you know what I mean?"" he asked, laughing. ""That’s the only reason I went to social media with it. Because I did go to him personally and text him, 'Like, yo, bro, what the hell? I’m here, we’ve been talking. What’s going on?'"" Drake didn't get his invite due to a simple case of Josh and his wife, Paige O'Brien, being overwhelmed with all the planning that went into putting together a wedding.

A source told US magazine OK!: “When they got back together, Liam thought things would be different, but Miley hasn’t changed at all.  “She’s sobered up but she’s still immature and isn’t ready to commit to spending the rest of her life with one person.  “They do love each other but at this point it’s starting to become clear this relationship simply can’t go the distance.”  Miley and Liam are have tried couple’s therapy according to the magazine, but it hasn’t worked and only led to more fights. Liam is also said by friends to be envious of his brother, Chris, having three kids with his wife Elsa Pataky, but while he’s feeling more and more broody, Miley is not ready to commit to children and wants to focus on her career and having fun.","You are a journalist.

The news has sent shockwaves through Hollywood, with sources close to the couple revealing that they have been having trouble reconciling their differences and finding a way forward.

This is not the first time that the couple has faced challenges in their relationship. They were previously engaged in 2016 before calling off the wedding just a few months before the scheduled date. Since then, they have had several ups and downs, including a brief split in 2019. Despite their efforts to work through their issues, it seems that the couple has reached a point where they have decided to go their separate ways once again.

The decision to call off the engagement is a difficult one, and it is likely to have significant implications for both parties involved. The couple has been together for several years, and their relationship has been the subject of intense media scrutiny throughout that time. The breakdown of their engagement will no doubt be a topic of great interest to their fans and the public at large.

In a statement released earlier today, a representative for the couple confirmed that they have decided to go their separate ways. The statement read: ""After much consideration and thought, we have decided to go our separate ways. We appreciate the support and understanding of our fans and the public, and we ask for privacy at this time.""

The news of the couple's breakup has sent shockwaves through Hollywood, with many of their colleagues and friends expressing their sadness and disappointment at the news. The couple's split is a reminder that even the most seemingly solid relationships can be fragile and susceptible to the challenges and pressures of the outside world. As the couple moves forward, it is likely that they will face a difficult and emotional road ahead."

Beyoncé and Jay Z welcomed twins earlier this week, multiple sources confirm to Us Weekly.  Queen Bey, 35, announced in February that she and the rapper, 47, were expanding their family.  “We would like to share our love and happiness,” Beyoncé captioned an Instagram photo of her bare bump at the time. “We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes.”  The “Hold Up” singer documented her pregnancy on social media and made several red carpet appearances while expecting. Although she had to pull out of her headlining Coachella appearance, she attended the Grammys, the Beauty and the Beast premiere and the inaugural Wearable Art Gala at the California African American Museum.  The couple’s new twins join their daughter Blue Ivy, 5. “They have been trying for a long time and now to be blessed with twins they are so over the moon.

gossipcop-911679,0,"EXCLUSIVE: In a very competitive situation, Netflix has landed The Politician, a new hourlong comedy series from longtime collaborators Brad Falchuk, Ian Brennan and Ryan Murphy, I have learned. The project, starring Tony winner Ben Platt (Dear Evan Hansen), with Oscar winners Barbra Streisand and Gwyneth Paltrow in negotiations to co-star, has received a two-season straight-to-series order, I hear.  The deal, believed to be the biggest TV package sale of the year, came after a weeklong bidding war among top streaming players, including Amazon and Hulu, sources said. It gives prolific creator-producer Murphy two series on Netflix, along with the upcoming Ratched.  RESX/Shutterstock  As he does on all of his shows, Murphy will direct the pilot for The Politician, described as a one-hour comedy with social commentary. If Streisand and Paltrow’s deals close, Streisand will be part of the production team as well as directing, with Paltrow also expected to produce. It would be the first major TV series role for both feature actress.  Details about the plot and characters in The Politician are being kept under wraps, but according to a source close to the project, it revolves around the politician aspirations of Platt’s Payton, a wealthy Santa Barbarian, and every season will revolve around a different political race his character is involved in.  Rex/Shutterstock  I hear that Platt will have musical numbers in several episodes of the show. That, along with the potential involvement of Paltrow and Streisand, helped drive interest in the project, sparking a heated bidding and leading to the big Netflix deal.  Frequent collaborators Falchuk and Murphy had been quietly working on the script for The Politician for the past year. The two brought in their Glee co-creator Brennan, with the three expected to share co-creator credit. Platt also was attached early on and is heavily involved in the casting of the series, which eyes a potential late summer production start.  The project hails from Fox 21 TV Studios under Murphy’s overall deal at 20th Century Fox TV. Its packaging was guided by Fox TV Group chairman Dana Walden, a longtime Murphy collaborator who oversees the studio.  Paltrow previously worked on Falchuk, Murphy and Brennan’s Glee. The actress, who is engaged to Falchuk, won an Emmy for her guest-starring role on Fox’s high school musical dramedy.  The deal for The Politician comes on the heels of the successful launch of Falchuk and Murphy’s latest collaboration, drama series 9-1-1 (co-created with Tim Minear), which has been a breakout hit for Fox and was renewed for a second season only two episodes into its freshman run. The Politician marks Murphy and Falchuk’s fourth television series as co-creators, joining 9-1-1 as well as FX’s American Horror Story and the upcoming Pose (co-created by Steven Canals). Murphy is also the mastermind behind FX’s American Crime Story and Feud as well as Netflix’s upcoming Ratched starring Emmy winner Sarah Paulson (AHS franchise, People v. O.J. Simpson) as a younger version of the diabolical Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.  Netflix  Netflix has emerged as the streaming home of Murphy by snagging both of his series to hit the premium space in the past five months. The latest development is sure to further fuel speculation about the future of Murphy, one of the top creator-producers working in television today who has pulled off the rare feat of launching commercial and award-winning hits on both broadcast and cable. Netflix has been widely rumored to be among a slew of suitors for Murphy, whose current deal with 20th Century Fox TV expires later this year.  “I haven’t made a decision of where I’m going to go, I’m going to sit back and wait,” Murphy said at TCA last month when asked whether he would stay at the studio, which is in the process of being acquired by Disney.

Frequent collaborators Falchuk and Murphy had been quietly working on the script for The Politician for the past year. The two brought in their Glee co-creator Brennan, with the three expected to share co-creator credit. Platt also was attached early on and is heavily involved in the casting of the series, which eyes a potential late summer production start.  The project hails from Fox 21 TV Studios under Murphy’s overall deal at 20th Century Fox TV. Its packaging was guided by Fox TV Group chairman Dana Walden, a longtime Murphy collaborator who oversees the studio.  Paltrow previously worked on Falchuk, Murphy and Brennan’s Glee. The actress, who is engaged to Falchuk, won an Emmy for her guest-starring role on Fox’s high school musical dramedy.  The deal for The Politician comes on the heels of the successful launch of Falchuk and Murphy’s latest collaboration, drama series 9-1-1 (co-created with Tim Minear), which has been a breakout hit for Fox and was renewed for a second season only two episodes into its freshman run. The Politician marks Murphy and Falchuk’s fourth television series as co-creators, joining 9-1-1 as well as FX’s American Horror Story and the upcoming Pose (co-created by Steven Canals). Murphy is also the mastermind behind FX’s American Crime Story and Feud as well as Netflix’s upcoming Ratched starring Emmy winner Sarah Paulson (AHS franchise, People v. O.J. Simpson) as a younger version of the diabolical Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.  Netflix  Netflix has emerged as the streaming home of Murphy by snagging both of his series to hit the premium space in the past five months. The latest development is sure to further fuel speculation about the future of Murphy, one of the top creator-producers working in television today who has pulled off the rare feat of launching commercial and award-winning hits on both broadcast and cable. Netflix has been widely rumored to be among a slew of suitors for Murphy, whose current deal with 20th Century Fox TV expires later this year.  “I haven’t made a decision of where I’m going to go, I’m going to sit back and wait,” Murphy said at TCA last month when asked whether he would stay at the studio, which is in the process of being acquired by Disney. A mega deal at merged Disney-Fox or a streaming giant like Netflix, a production venture, possibly with "

Kelly Clarkson and Gwen Stefani: A Friendship for the Ages?

In the latest season of The Voice, fans have been treated to a new dynamic between coaches Kelly Clarkson and Gwen Stefani. While the two have long been admired for their respective talents in the music industry, it's clear that they have formed a special bond behind the scenes.

According to sources close to the show, Clarkson and Stefani have been spending more and more time together during filming, often giggling and chatting between takes. ""They just click,"" said one insider. ""They have so much in common, from their love of music to their wicked senses of humor.""

Clarkson, who is in her first season as a coach on the show, has been particularly impressed with Stefani's expertise and creativity. ""Gwen is just a genius,"" she gushed in a recent interview. ""I've learned so much from her already, and I can't wait to see what she brings to the table next.""

Stefani, for her part, has been equally effusive in her praise for Clarkson. ""Kelly is just a total sweetheart,"" she said in a recent interview. ""She's so talented and so kind, and I feel so lucky to be working with her.""

While the two have yet to publicly confirm any sort of romantic involvement, their chemistry on set is undeniable. ""They're like two peas in a pod,"" said one observer. ""You can just tell that they're meant to be together.""

Only time will tell if Clarkson and Stefani's friendship will blossom into something more, but for now, fans are just happy to see these two music icons together on screen. As one fan tweeted, ""Kelly and Gwen are the ultimate #VoiceSquad."" We couldn't agree more."

Hollywood superstar Scarlett Johansson and Food Network sensation Bobby Flay have been the talk of the town after they were spotted enjoying a friendly dinner together over the weekend. Photographs of the pair strolling out of a popular restaurant late Sunday night sparked speculation about a possible romance between the two, but a rep for the ""Avengers"" actress has confirmed that there is no truth to the rumors.

According to the rep, Johansson and Flay, who is known for his hit cooking shows and restaurants, simply enjoyed a friendly meal together and are not dating. The dinner was reportedly a casual affair, with the two stars laughing and chatting over a meal that included some of Flay's signature dishes.

While the rumor mill has been working overtime to suggest otherwise, it seems that Johansson and Flay are just friends and there is no romance brewing between them. The actress has been linked to several high-profile men in recent months, including her ""Avengers"" co-star Chris Evans, but it seems that she is not currently involved in any romantic relationships.

For his part, Flay has been married three times and has two daughters with his second wife, Stephanie March. He and March divorced in 2015 after 10 years of marriage. Despite his high-profile personal life, Flay has remained tight-lipped about his love life in recent years, preferring to focus on his culinary career and his hit Food Network shows.

In any case, it's clear that Johansson and Flay had a great time together over the weekend, and we're sure that their friendly dinner will be the subject of much speculation in the days and weeks to come."
gossipcop-3414394050,1,"Broadway star Jennifer Holliday has backed out as a performer at next week's presidential inaugural, saying she did not realize that her participation would be interpreted as a statement of support for President-elect Donald Trump.  Jennifer Holliday is backing out of performing at Trump's inauguration celebration after receiving backlash from her fans. Kareem Quow for KQ Photography  Holliday, best known for her Tony-winning role in Broadway's ""Dreamgirls,"" faced pressure from her gay, lesbian and black fans when it was announced she would sing at a Thursday concert at Washington's Lincoln Memorial.  Holliday said in a statement Saturday that she apologized for her lapse of judgment, for being uneducated on the issues and causing heartbreak for her fans.  Several prominent entertainers have declined to perform at Trump inaugural festivities. Country star Toby Keith and actor Jon Voigt are in the lineup for Thursday's concert.  Holliday's reversal was first reported by The Wrap; the publication obtained a letter Holliday wrote to her fans. Her representative, Bill Carpenter, confirmed the details in the letter to The Associated Press.  ""My only choice must now be to stand with the LGBT Community and to state unequivocally that I WILL NOT PERFORM FOR THE WELCOME CONCERT OR FOR ANY OF THE INAUGURATION FESTIVITIES!"" she wrote.  ""Please know that I HEAR YOU and I feel your pain. The LGBT Community was mostly responsible for birthing my career and I am deeply indebted to you,"" she added. ""You have loved me faithfully and unconditionally and for so many years you provided me with work even though my star had long since faded.""  Related: Toby Keith, 3 Doors Down to Play Inauguration-Related Event  In an interview with The Associated Press on Friday, Holliday defended her decision to perform at the inauguration.  ""I didn't see it as singing for Trump; I saw it as singing for the people on the mall,"" Holliday told the AP.  The performer, who most recently starred on Broadway in ""The Color Purple,"" said she was hurt by the angry backlash, which included calls to boycott her music. Others called her ""Uncle Tom"" and there was even a suggestion that she take her own life.  ""It just really made my heart drop to my feet,"" Holliday said. ""How could I have this much hate spewing at me, and I haven't even done anything? I guess it's not like those old days when political views were your own and you had freedom of speech. ...

Welcome Celebration"" which included Keith, Voight, and Trump himself.  The celebrity wattage for Trump's inaugural festivities doesn't rival that of Barack Obama's inaugurations, which attracted top names including Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen, U2, Alicia Keys, Kelly Clarkson, Eva Longoria and Jennifer Hudson, among others. But Trump has insisted that's how he wants it, saying the swearing-in festivities should be about the people, not the A-list stars.","You are a journalist.

New York, NY - In a surprise move, Broadway star Jennifer Holliday has withdrawn her participation as a performer at next week's presidential inaugural, citing a lack of understanding about the political implications of her involvement. In a statement released today, Holliday said that she did not realize that her performance would be interpreted as a statement of support for President-elect Donald Trump.

""I have always prided myself on being a performer who transcends politics and brings people together,"" Holliday said. ""However, I have come to realize that my participation in the inaugural would be misinterpreted as a show of support for the President-elect, and I do not wish to be a part of anything that could be divisive.""

Holliday, who is best known for her Tony-nominated performance in the musical ""Dreamgirls,"" was scheduled to perform at the inaugural ceremony next week. However, she has now withdrawn from the event, saying that she cannot in good conscience participate in an event that may be perceived as endorsing Trump.

The decision has sparked a heated debate, with some praising Holliday for her stance and others criticizing her for withdrawing from the event at the last minute. However, Holliday remains resolute in her decision, saying that she cannot ignore the potential consequences of her actions.

""I understand that my decision may be unpopular with some, but I cannot in good conscience contribute to an event that may be perceived as endorsing a candidate or administration that I do not support,"" Holliday said. ""I hope that my decision will be respected, and that we can all come together to celebrate the diversity and unity of our great nation.""

The withdrawal of Holliday from the inaugural ceremony is the latest in a series of high-profile defections from the event, which has been marked by controversy and protests. Other performers, including Elton John and Celine Dion, have also declined to participate in the event.

In a statement, the President-elect's inaugural committee expressed disappointment at Holliday's decision, saying that she was a ""talented performer"" who would have been a great addition to the event. However, the committee did not indicate any plans to replace Holliday with another performer.

The inaugural ceremony, which will take place on January 20, is expected to be a contentious event, with many protesters and activists planning to demonstrate against the President-elect's policies and actions. The event has already been marred by controversy, with several high-profile performers and speakers withdrawing from the event in recent days."

Nicole Kidman was among the best dressed of the night in a red halter Calvin Klein Calvin Klein by Appointment gown with a pleated bust. “Handmaid’s” Yvonne Strahovski also worked the red hot shade in a custom Julien MacDonald silk number, as did Sarah Hyland in a fiery cutout Zac Posen, Heidi Klum in plunging Peter Dundas, and Issa Rae in an asymmetrical Vera Wang. (""The Handmaid's Tale"" author Margaret Atwood was also notably in red.) “A red dress is fiery, it’s sexy, it’s a universal power color,” celebrity stylist Robert Verdi told Moneyish. “And it also says ‘resistance’ in my opinion, so it makes a strong statement.” Viola Davis wore Zac Posen. (Frazer Harrison/Getty Images) The white haute women included Evan Rachel Wood in a Moschino gown with cropped tuxedo jacket, Priyanka Chopra in long-sleeved Balmain, Sofia Vergara in a strapless figure-hugging Mark Zunino mermaid gown, and “Stranger Things’” adorable Millie Bobby Brown in a ballerina-inspired Calvin Klein gown with full tulle princess skirt. Priyanka Chopra wore Balmain. (Rich Polk/Getty Images) “White always emerges when people are desperate for change in our culture,” mused Verdi, “because it’s a blank canvas for new beginnings.” And the summer’s glitter trend was on full display, with sequins and beads dusted across almost everyone, including Lea Michele’s belted purple Elie Saab gown, Tracee Ellis Ross’s silver Chanel disco ball, Leslie Jones’ black sparkling Christian Siriano, and Ellie Kemper’s midnight blue capsleeve Jenny Packham gown. “Glitter is so hot right now, and it was sparkle, sparkle, sparkle everywhere, and lots of sequin sand silver,” Tom Fitzgerald, co-creator of the fashion and pop culture blog TomandLorenzo.com with Lorenzo Marquez, told Moneyish. Other standouts included Viola Davis in juicy orange Zac Posen, Jane Fonda in long-sleeved hot pink Brandon Maxwell (with long, sleek ponytail to match), and both Tessa Thompson and Zoe Kravitz chasing the rainbow; the former in a pleated metallic Rosie Assoulin, and the latter in a feathery cascading Dior. Tessa Thompson wore Rosie Assoui. (Rich Polk/Getty Images) “There were a lot of movie stars on the red carpet this year, so there was a heightened sense of glamour. If you know Nicole Kidman is going to be there, you’re gonna bring your A game,” said Fitzgerald. “And we are at peak TV with all of the incredible programming now, so it’s become more much competitive, and the Emmys are closer in tone to the Oscars than it used to be.” While the Emmys ratings have dipped the past couple of years, more than 11 million people tuned into last year’s awards show - and the glamorous gowns worn by the nominees and presenters on any awards show red carpet influence what the $15.6 billion dress industry will put on the rack next spring. Remember when Amal Clooney wore white opera gloves to the 2015 Golden Globes? Long gloves appeared on the fall/winter runways of Marc Jacobs and Prada later that year. Millie Bobby Brown wore Calvin Klein. (Frazer Harrison/Getty Images) “You’ll see silhouettes shift now, thanks to the classic and demure 1950s and 60s looks on Nicole Kidman and Millie Bobby Brown, that kind of princess-style dress,” said Verdi. “You’ll see these popular colors (red, white, silver, the pops of orange and green) trickle down into ready-to-wear fashion. And you’ll see the fabrics - like the sparkle and lace we saw on the carpet - be used to embellish affordable versions of these gowns.” And you may even be able to snap up at least one of Sunday’s red carpet looks yourself. While many movie and TV stories are loaned their designer gowns for these award shows - or are sometimes paid between $100,000 and $250,000 to wear a label for all of the free publicity it will bring the brand - singer and presenter Rachel Bloom revealed to E! that she had to pay for her $3,500 Gucci gown out of pocket. “A lot of fashion houses are reluctant to lend clothes that aren’t in the sample sizes of 0 and 2, so it’s getting harder and harder for me to find clothes without buying them,” she said. “That’s the whole problem with the fashion industry: My body size is literally normal and healthy but when you put me next to a model I look obese.” Rachel Bloom bought her Gucci gown. ""It's hard to get places to lend me dresses b/c I'm not a size 0, but I can afford it so it's OK"" #Emmys pic.twitter.com/pevV8HgfWj — Jarett Wieselman (@JarettSays) September 17, 2017 Verdi noted this is an issue because the competition for these couture gowns is fierce. “There’s only a few great dresses in any given collection every season, and every stylist is trying to pull them for the celebrities that they are dressing,” he said. “So when the fashion houses are assessing who these should go to, they want it to go to a nominee over a presenter; to a global star versus a national star; to someone younger over someone older - those are what the ‘rules’ would be.” And, often, to someone slimmer over someone curvier, as stars like Melissa McCarthy and Leslie Jones (both nominated Sunday night) have been public about their struggles to find designers to dress them. But Bloom noted that she’s fortunate to be in a financial position where she can buy her dress. And she might get some money back for the gently-used gown, anyway. “I can always resell it,” she said. “I do have an account on [the","You are a journalist.

If you know Nicole Kidman is going to be there, you’re gonna bring your A game,” said Fitzgerald. “And we are at peak TV with all of the incredible programming now, so it’s become more much competitive, and the Emmys are closer in tone to the Oscars than it used to be.” While the Emmys ratings have dipped the past couple of years, more than 11 million people tuned into last year’s awards show - and the glamorous gowns worn by the nominees and presenters on any awards show red carpet influence what the $15.6 billion dress industry will put on the rack next spring. Remember when Amal Clooney wore white opera gloves to the 2015 Golden Globes? Long gloves appeared on the fall/winter runways of Marc Jacobs and Prada later that year. Millie Bobby Brown wore Calvin Klein. (Frazer Harrison/Getty Images) “You’ll see silhouettes shift now, thanks to the classic and demure 1950s and 60s looks on Nicole Kidman and Millie Bobby Brown, that kind of princess-style dress,” said Verdi. “You’ll see these popular colors (red, white, silver, the pops of orange and green) trickle down into ready-to-wear fashion. And you’ll see the fabrics - like the sparkle and lace we saw on the carpet - be used to embellish affordable versions of these gowns.” And you may even be able to snap up at least one of Sunday’s red carpet looks yourself. While many movie and TV stories are loaned their designer gowns for these award shows - or are sometimes paid between $100,000 and $250,000 to wear a label for all of the free publicity it will bring the brand - singer and presenter Rachel Bloom revealed to E! that she had to pay for her $3,500 Gucci gown out of pocket. “A lot of fashion houses are reluctant to lend clothes that aren’t in the sample sizes of 0 and 2, so it’s getting harder and harder for me to find clothes without buying them,” she said. “That’s the whole problem with the fashion industry: My body size is literally normal and healthy but when you put me next to a model I look obese.” Rachel Bloom bought her Gucci gown.

But Bloom noted that she’s fortunate to be in a financial position where she can buy her dress. And she might get some money back for the gently-used gown, anyway. “I can always resell it,” she said. “I do have an account on [the"
gossipcop-2194660040,1,"First Lady Melania Trump claims there is a secret poisoner in the White House and fears her husband is being slowly poisoned with “heavy sedatives” smuggled into his drinks in an attempt to slow him down, control him, and discredit his presidency, according to reports.  While public debate rages about Donald Trump’s health, Melania has told friends and associates that the once robust and high energy man she knew and loved has been replaced with a “slower, damaged version”.  “By 8pm he is slurring,” she said. “This is not the man I know.”  Fearing that the sedatives are being pumped into the body of the POTUS via Coca-Cola that he orders by pressing a button he had installed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Melania has insisted he stop drinking from the tap and instead revert to drinking from cans she brings herself.  “Donald’s heath improved out of sight when he stopped drinking from the tap,” Melania said.  However the First Lady fears the active campaign to poison the president is “a high level operation” and “not the work of a solitary loon.”  Melania is popular in the White House—as she is with the rest of the country—and she has befriended senior intelligence agency staff who remain loyal to president. They have educated her about Ronald Regan’s poisoning by the Deep State after his assassination attempt in 1981. They have also warned her that George W. Bush was reduced to a “brain damaged” state after years of steady poisoning.  But the advantage Trump may hold over his GOP predecessors in the Oval Office is that he has a wife who is wise to the ruse and is insisting he watch his food and drink intake closely for signs of adulteration.  Donald Trump’s food choices say a lot about the man. The president’s Howard Hughes-level pickiness when it comes to food is partly motivated by a desire to avoid being poisoned, according to Melania. He doesn’t trust those around him – and rightfully so.  As President Trump knows all too well, there are enemies of the state dug in deep at the White House.  Reporters from TIME recently got a glimpse behind-the-scenes at the White House, where they reported on what goes down at the president’s dinner table. Of particular interest was a meal enjoyed by the reporters, Trump, and Vice President Pence.  Pence’s meal was not unusual—he ate what everyone else did. But the POTUS received a meal fully customized to his own preferences, and closely observed by Melania who insisted on watching the chef prepare the meal with ingredients she provided herself.","You are a journalist.

According to reports, Mrs. Trump believes that the poisoning is an attempt to slow down her husband, control him, and discredit his presidency.

The First Lady's allegations have sent shockwaves throughout the White House and the nation, with many people expressing concern and outrage over the alleged plot. The President's health and well-being have been a subject of speculation for months, with some critics accusing him of being in cognitive decline.

However, the White House has dismissed Mrs. Trump's claims as ""baseless and ridiculous,"" saying that the President is in good health and that there is no evidence to support the First Lady's allegations. The President's physician, Dr. Ronny Jackson, has also released a statement saying that the President is in excellent physical and mental health.

Despite the denials, many people are taking Mrs. Trump's claims seriously, with some calling for an investigation into the matter. The alleged poisoning plot has raised questions about the safety of the President and the security of the White House, and some are expressing concern about the potential consequences of such an act.

The situation is still developing, and it remains to be seen how the allegations will be addressed and what the outcome will be. In the meantime, the nation is holding its breath, hoping that the President and the First Lady will be able to resolve the issue and ensure the safety of the President and the security of the White House."

The action star has steadily starred in film after film, yet has been at the center of several dating rumors.  As the International Business Times reports, “The actor was mistakenly linked to an Australian journalist and then was associated to his Mission: Impossible 6 co-star and Crown actress Vanessa Kirby.”  All rumors until now have been stamped out as false.  However, the latest claims include those stating that members of the Church of Scientology have once again been playing matchmaker for the Top Gun star and that Cruise has reportedly been secretly dating over the past little while. Interestingly enough, Tom has reportedly been using a disguise to enjoy dates with the ladies, much like Katie Holmes did in the initial stages of her romance with Jamie Foxx.  A source told the publication about Cruise’s tactics to keep his love life out of the spotlight.  “Tom’s back on the dating scene, but nobody knows it’s him. His face is way too recognizable for him to stroll into the bars, so he has his makeup artist create a silicone mask. Seems like Tom took his Mission: Impossible role to heart. It’s just what Ethan Hunt would do in the movies.”  It’s also been claimed that the disguise, which includes makeup, takes a full five hours to apply. If this rumor all sounds a little far-fetched, that’s because it is completely untrue, according to Gossip Cop. Tom Cruise does not go through some elaborate process to secretly step out on dates. In fact, there has not been any confirmation that Tom Cruise has dated anyone since Katie Holmes.  Alberto E. Rodriguez / Getty Images  Katie Holmes, however, continues to attempt to keep her romance with Jamie Foxx a secret, despite the fact that the pair has been spotted on numerous occasions over the past year on beach getaways and romantic locales like Paris.

Subtitle: Sources reveal the actress has been relying on her 'Twilight' co-star for support during her recent romantic dry spell

Los Angeles, CA - Drew Barrymore, the renowned actress and heartthrob, may have been lamenting her lack of a dating life in recent interviews, but RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal that she has found a comforting distraction in the form of her 'Twilight' co-star, Kristen Stewart.

According to sources close to the matter, Barrymore and Stewart have been relying on each other for support during their respective romantic dry spells. While Barrymore has been unsuccessful in her recent dating endeavors, Stewart has been dealing with the aftermath of her highly publicized split from ex-partner Robert Pattinson.

""Drew and Kristen have been there for each other through thick and thin,"" a source revealed to RadarOnline.com. ""They've been supporting each other emotionally and offering words of encouragement during these difficult times.""

The source added that the two actresses have been spending more time together, engaging in intimate conversations and sharing their experiences in the industry.

Barrymore, 43, and Stewart, 28, have been long-time friends, having starred together in the 2010 film 'Going the Distance'. Their friendship has endured despite their respective high-profile breakups and the challenges they've faced in their personal lives.

While neither Barrymore nor Stewart has publicly confirmed the nature of their relationship, sources close to the matter suggest that their bond has deepened in recent months.

""Drew and Kristen are two strong, independent women who have found comfort in each other's company,"" the source stated. ""They're not looking for anything serious at the moment, but they're enjoying each other's company and supporting each other through this challenging time.""

The news of Barrymore and Stewart's close friendship comes as a surprise to many, given their vastly different public personas. However, their bond serves as a testament to the enduring power of female friendship and the importance of having a support system in the entertainment industry.

With their respective acting careers still thriving, it remains to be seen whether Barrymore and Stewart will explore a romantic relationship in the future. For now, their focus appears to be on supporting each other through the ups and downs of life in the public eye."

Raised in SoHo and on the Lower East Side by a father descended from Spanish nobility and a mother who is a policy analyst on women’s issues in Third World countries, de la Huerta had been acting and modeling since her teens, and now seemed to be breaking through. The year before she had co-starred in Gaspar Noé’s Enter the Void, which had recently opened in the U.S. And her recurring role on HBO’s just-premiered Prohibition-period gangster drama, Boardwalk Empire, as mistress to Steve Buscemi’s Enoch “Nucky” Thompson, had earned her critical praise.  One night that November, de la Huerta ran into Harvey Weinstein at the Top of the Standard bar at the Standard, High Line hotel in Manhattan. She had first met Weinstein while making the movie Cider House Rules when she was 14. De la Huerta had communicated with the producer over the years after their first meeting. At around age 21, she said, Weinstein sent her some science-fiction books and suggested she might be right for a role in one of his projects. When they met at the hotel in 2010 de la Huerta was 26 and Weinstein was at the height of his powers as an Oscar-winning producer. The Weinstein Company was about to enter a streak that would see it win best picture at the Academy Awards two years in a row, first for The King’s Speech in 2011 and then The Artist in 2012. Weinstein offered de la Huerta a ride home to Tribeca. In de la Huerta’s account of the night, Weinstein arrived at her apartment demanding to come inside and have a drink. “Things got very uncomfortable very fast,” the actress, now 33, told Vanity Fair in a phone interview on Wednesday.  “Immediately when we got inside the house, he started to kiss me and I kind of brushed [him] away,” de la Huerta said. “Then he pushed me onto the bed and his pants were down and he lifted up my skirt. I felt afraid. . . . It wasn’t consensual . . . It happened very quickly. . . . He stuck himself inside me. . . . When he was done he said he’d be calling me.

The actress said she had been drinking, and was frightened by Weinstein, who had been repeatedly calling her, despite her asking him to leave her alone. “He hushed me and said, ‘Let’s talk about this in your apartment,’” de la Huerta said. “I was in no state. I was so terrified of him. . . . I did say no, and when he was on top of me I said, ‘I don’t want to do this.’ He kept humping me and it was disgusting. He’s like a pig. . . .

LOS ANGELES - Actor Robert Pattinson has sparked questions about the status of his relationship with singer FKA twigs after making some unexpected comments about their engagement during a recent interview.

Speaking with radio host Howard Stern, the 31-year-old actor revealed that he is only ""kind of"" engaged to twigs, causing some to wonder if the couple's relationship is as solid as previously thought.

Pattinson's comments have raised eyebrows among fans and media outlets, with some speculating that the couple may be experiencing some issues in their relationship.

The actor's remarks come just over a year after twigs, whose real name is Tahliah Debrett Barnett, confirmed that the two were engaged during an interview with Style magazine. At the time, twigs gushed about Pattinson, saying, ""He's the love of my life.""

Despite Pattinson's recent comments, sources close to the couple have insisted that everything is fine between them. However, the actor's words have left some wondering if all is not well in paradise.

The couple, who have been dating since 2014, have been notoriously private about their relationship, rarely speaking publicly about their romance.

Pattinson's comments have sparked a flurry of speculation and gossip, with some fans taking to social media to express their concerns about the couple's relationship.

For now, it remains to be seen if Pattinson and twigs will address the situation publicly or if they will continue to keep their relationship private. One thing is certain, however - the couple's engagement is no longer the sure thing it once seemed to be."

Born Kate Garry Hudson on April 19, 1979, in Los Angeles, California, US, she came to prominence in 2001 with her incredible turn in Almost Famous. This role not only made her famous, but it also fetched her a Golden Globe and several nominations, including a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Being a daughter of American actress Goldie Hawn, Hudson bears more than a passing resemblance to her famous mother in both looks and onscreen vivacity. She got the chance to showcase her talent in 1996, when she made her TV debut on Fox's TV series Party of Five (1994-2000). Although she only appeared in one episode titled ""Spring Breaks: Part 1"", this initial experience was enough to uphold her determination to develop a professional acting career in Hollywood. However, it was in 1999 that she started to attract public attention when critics lauded her brilliant portrayal of Cindy in ""200 Cigarettes"", even though the movie itself was a commercial disappointment. Onwards, her career experienced a significant advancement, especially after she managed to obtain a supporting role in ""Gossip"" and ""Dr T and the Women"" which both came up in 2000. While her accolade-worthy performance in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous indicated that she was set to follow her mother in taking the film industry by storm. In the midst of a whirlwind schedule of fashion shoots and awards shows, she made an appearance in the romantic war drama The Four Feathers in 2002. Turning out to be a box-office failure, Hudson fired back with the surefire hit as she starred opposite quirky heartthrob Matthew McConaughey in the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003). She continued to establish herself as a fully-fledged actress starring in subsequent productions like Raising Helen (2004), The Skeleton Key (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), Fool's Gold (2008) and Bride Wars (2009). As of most recent, she could be seen in the musical comedy-drama television series Glee as Cassandra July.","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news.

Shelton tweeted after multiple outlets reported Lambert began dating married Turnpike Troubadours front man, Evan Felker.  But according to Lambert's ex-boyfriend Jeff Allen, Shelton is not as innocent as he's trying to seem.  Allen tweeted and deleted a post calling out Shelton for romancing Allen's then-girlfriend Lambert while Shelton was still married to his first wife, Kaynette Williams, in 2006.  ""You know, I’ve always given you the benefit of the doubt and chalked it up to just being human, but you must be one arrogant SOB to pop off something like this, when I know damn good and well you were cheating on your wife and Miranda was cheating on me when you two started up,"" Allen wrote in a since-deleted tweet, according to Us Weekly.  ""I kept my mouth shut for 13 years. Sorry, his karma tweet rubbed me wrong. All of this is pointless,"" he added.  Allen told RadarOnline.com, ""I’m sure Miranda did [Blake] dirty just like she did me, but he wasn’t thinking about me when he was cheating with her, so I don’t know why he thinks it's karma.""  He added that he does not harbor bad feelings toward Lambert and said she ""was a loving, caring person and a good girlfriend.""

Though she has commented on it via Twitter in the past, as it turns out, why Bekah M. was reported missing is a totally relatable story. While appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Kimmel interviewed Bekah M., or Bekah Martinez, over a video call. After he asked if she got her pink fringed earrings from the marijuana farm — the North Coast Journal reported that the former Bachelor contestant had gone to Humboldt to work on a marijuana farm — Martinez got a chance to explain the whole story.  TheNorth Coast Journal listed her as a missing person in Humboldt County, California on Feb. 1. (The Northern California newspaper reported Bekah M. as being one of the ""Humboldt 35,"" which included a list of 34 other missing persons. The list is now down to 33, according to the Journal, thanks to Bekah M. being accounted for.) ""First of all,"" she told Kimmel. ""A lot of people thought I lied to my mother saying I was on a farm when I was actually on the Bachelor but no, I had already been eliminated from the show.""

The fact that she then went away to have a fun week with her friends makes sense, but it also led to some of the confusion as to why she'd gone MIA since many people suspected that Bekah M. was chosen by Arie Luyendyk, Jr. on The Bachelor.  After all, since Bachelor contestants have strict rules about phone usage, it made sense that Bekah M. would not call her mom for a few days in a row. And, since Nov. 18 would likely be when The Bachelor was wrapping up, it made fans think that she had made it to the final two — or that she was the one Luyendyk picked.  But, as it turns out, Bekah M. had been eliminated and she simply went away. ""I just decided to go up to the mountains with friends for a couple weeks and I was there for six or seven days without phone service,"" she told Kimmel. ""I thought that I was going to have phone service, and I told my mother that I would. I just had this weird feeling on the six or seventh day and I was like 'I need to go home now' so I got in my car, drove to where I had service, called my parents, and then come to find out only 12 hours before, my mother had called the Humboldt Sheriff's Department saying that I was missing.""  As for why the North Coast Journal reported that Martinez was on a marijuana farm when she'd just told Kimmel she wanted to go to the mountains, well, you'd have to know a bit about the local geography.

In case you're not from California, you should probably know that Humboldt County is densely populated with marijuana farms.

Besides the much-needed clarification, one of the best revelations to come from Bekah M.'s appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live was the fact that the Bachelor contestant remained close with Kendall. It even sounds like she has stayed close with most of the contestants from Arie's Bachelor season, except Tia, who played a big part in Martinez's elimination.

Apparently, it's a desperate attempt to ignore the truth. “She continues to send him loving social media support from LA while he’s been out on the road,” said another insider. “But Blake has drastically slowed regular communication with her.” He certainly hasn't reciprocated her online affection.

Apparently, Gwen was jealous over his closeness with The Voice winner Chloe Kohanski, and Blake got sick of trying to make her trust him. “She told him she didn’t want to spend her life in fear of her famous partner cheating on her.""  “Blake told Gwen that he was going to be doing the latter part of the monthlong Country Freaks Tour without her,” said the source. “Gwen was so used to accompanying him on tour, she was upended.

Even worse, Blake has been looking for solace with newly-single ex-wife Miranda Lambert! “Miranda reached out to Blake via text,” said the insider. “Ultimately, they buried the hatchet and have been supporting each other through their latest troubled relationships.

Music's Hottest Couple No More: Blake Shelton Dumps Gwen Stefani Before Tour

In a shocking turn of events, Music's hottest couple, Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani, has reportedly called it quits. According to In Touch, Shelton left Stefani high and dry before heading off on tour in February, and the No Doubt frontwoman is said to be taking it very hard.

The couple, who have been dating for two years, were considered one of the most beloved and admired celebrity couples in the industry. Their chemistry on The Voice, where they both serve as judges, was undeniable, and their relationship seemed to be going strong.

However, sources close to the couple have revealed that Shelton's busy touring schedule and long hours on the road may have taken a toll on their relationship. ""Blake's been touring non-stop for the past few months, and it's been really hard on Gwen,"" a source told In Touch. ""She's been feeling really lonely and neglected, and ultimately, she decided she couldn't do it anymore.""

Stefani, who has been open about her struggles with dating and relationships in the past, is said to be heartbroken over the split. ""Gwen is devastated. She thought she had found her soulmate in Blake, but apparently, he didn't feel the same way,"" the source revealed.

Shelton, who is currently on tour with his fellow Voice judge Adam Levine, has not publicly commented on the split. However, insiders say that he has been ""ghosting"" Stefani for weeks, ignoring her calls and texts and avoiding her at all costs.

The split has left fans of the couple in shock and disbelief. ""I can't believe it. They were the perfect couple,"" one fan tweeted. ""I'm so sad for Gwen. She deserves so much better than to be left high and dry like this,"" another fan wrote.

As for what's next for the former couple, it's unclear at this time. Stefani has not publicly commented on the split, and it's unknown whether she will continue to appear on The Voice without Shelton by her side. One thing is for sure, however: this split is sure to send shockwaves through the entertainment industry and leave fans reeling for days to come."

Kaley Cuoco, star of the hit television show The Big Bang Theory, has gained a newfound appreciation for ice following her recent shoulder surgery. The 32-year-old actress took to her Instagram Story on Saturday to document her recovery process, sharing a video of herself icing her healing shoulder.

The video of Cuoco icing her shoulder is the latest update from the actress on her recovery process, and fans are eagerly awaiting her return to the small screen. Cuoco has not yet announced a return date, but with her recovery well underway, it's only a matter of time before she's back to her usual antics as Penny on The Big Bang Theory.

gossipcop-895312,0,"Kára McCullough, Miss District of Columbia, was crowned Miss USA 2017 during the sparkly pageant Sunday night in Las Vegas. And while it would be wholly reasonable for her to spend this next week in bed (or at least on a couch in sweatpants, maybe sequinned sweatpants) relaxing and eating carbs, in the day and a half since her victory, she's upped and moved to New York City and begun an already-intense round of media appearances. Heavy is the head that wears the crown, after all, even if Kára says that crown is actually super light. As her first in-depth interview, Kára spoke with Cosmopolitan.com on Tuesday morning. Read on for her take on the controversy surrounding her Q&A moments, both health care and ""equalism,"" as well as what she's most looking forward to now she's in NYC. OK, it's street food, but guess what kind?! So, you’re coming off just a kind of busy weekend, you know? How are you feeling this morning?! I'm well. I feel well-rested! I looked in the mirror this morning, and I was like, Whoa, I am Miss USA. And it just hit me [for the first time] like a ton of bricks. This entire experience has been so life-changing. And it’s just begun! I'm just so excited. I know there'll be tiring days coming up, but I'm really energized. I think the two bags of green tea that went in my cup this morning are really helping. What does the crown feel like? Oh my goodness. It feels like a halo. If I could really explain it, it’s like that halo Snapchat filter; just imagine that. It’s so light, and I just can’t even believe that I’ve been honored and graced with this opportunity to wear it. Courtesy of Miss USA During the live broadcast, was there a moment when you went from being “confidently beautiful” to, say, confident you could win? Well, I showed up to win! But really, I think [that moment] came when they called me for top three. I was the first one [called]. I remember standing on the little box that they had us positioned on, and I just lifted my head and asked God for guidance, and just let him know I was extremely thankful. I think that was like my turning point, like OK, Kára, you could really have this in the bag. You could take this all the way back to D.C. Last year’s Miss USA, Deshauna Barber, was also Miss District of Columbia. Was that something that ever psyched you out or made you second-guess your chances? Absolutely. There were like a lot of naysayers in my ear, saying, ""Ah, bad luck, states don't win back-to-back."" But I had to let them know Drake put that out there in the universe for us and [D.C.] came back strong. Deshauna is just such a phenomenal person and she really broke so many pageant stereotypes. I'm just so thankful to have her as a sister, a friend, and a mentor — and her crowing me is by far one of the most honorable achievements that I've had. In many respects, I think you’re also breaking some of those “pageant stereotypes” — your career in nuclear sciences, for example. How did you get into that line of work? I have a degree in chemistry [with a concentration] in radiochemistry from South Carolina State University, and I started my career at the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2013. My day-to-day job now involves nuclear licensing and regulations; the agency focuses on emergency preparedness for nuclear energy domestically. I can't even begin to tell you how much [my colleagues] have supported me. Initially I kept it a secret that I ran for Miss D.C. USA, but someone shared it on Facebook, and then the word got out, and there’s been a real outpouring [of love]. Everyone has been great. Will promoting the sciences be part of your Miss USA platform? Absolutely. [I run] a self-funded program called Science Exploration for Kids, which encourages students to find joy in the STEM subjects, as well as a career path. I run after-school programs and tutoring sessions and symposiums. It’s about any or all of the sciences, although I am biased; I love to see people major in chemistry — because the numbers [in that field] are so low. I was actually the only person in my class to graduate with a degree in radiochemistry, and so every summer, I had a phenomenal internship and I got paid! That's why I always try to encourage students to find joy in science, because the opportunities are endless. And I love getting to see children having fun and enjoying their projects, and I just hope to expand their imagination through science. Do you have a go-to experiment to pique kids’ interest from the get-go?

And while it would be wholly reasonable for her to spend this next week in bed (or at least on a couch in sweatpants, maybe sequinned sweatpants) relaxing and eating carbs, in the day and a half since her victory, she's upped and moved to New York City and begun an already-intense round of media appearances. Heavy is the head that wears the crown, after all, even if Kára says that crown is actually super light. As her first in-depth interview, Kára spoke with Cosmopolitan.com on Tuesday morning. Read on for her take on the controversy surrounding her Q&A moments, both health care and ""equalism,"" as well as what she's most looking forward to now she's in NYC. OK, it's street food, but guess what kind?! So, you’re coming off just a kind of busy weekend, you know? How are you feeling this morning?! I'm well. I feel well-rested! I looked in the mirror this morning, and I was like, Whoa, I am Miss USA. And it just hit me [for the first time] like a ton of bricks. This entire experience has been so life-changing. And it’s just begun! I'm just so excited. I know there'll be tiring days coming up, but I'm really energized. I think the two bags of green tea that went in my cup this morning are really helping. What does the crown feel like? Oh my goodness. It feels like a halo. If I could really explain it, it’s like that halo Snapchat filter; just imagine that. It’s so light, and I just can’t even believe that I’ve been honored and graced with this opportunity to wear it. Courtesy of Miss USA During the live broadcast, was there a moment when you went from being “confidently beautiful” to, say, confident you could win? Well, I showed up to win! But really, I think [that moment] came when they called me for top three. I was the first one [called]. I remember standing on the little box that they had us positioned on, and I just lifted my head and asked God for guidance, and just let him know I was extremely thankful. I think that was like my turning point, like OK, Kára, you could really have this in the bag. You could take this all the way back to D.C. Last year’s Miss USA, Deshauna Barber, was also Miss District of Columbia. Was that something that ever psyched you out or made you second-guess your chances? Absolutely. There were like a lot of naysayers in my ear, saying, ""Ah, bad luck, states don't win back-to-back."" But I had to let them know Drake put that out there in the universe for us and [D.C.] came back strong. Deshauna is just such a phenomenal person and she really broke so many pageant stereotypes. I'm just so thankful to have her as a sister, a friend, and a mentor — and her crowing me is by far one of the most honorable achievements that I've had. In many respects, I think you’re also breaking some of those “pageant stereotypes” — your career in nuclear sciences, for example. How did you get into that line of work? I have a degree in chemistry [with a concentration] in radiochemistry from South Carolina State University, and I started my career at the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2013. My day-to-day job now involves nuclear licensing and regulations; the agency focuses on emergency preparedness for nuclear energy domestically. I can't even begin to tell you how much [my colleagues] have supported me. Initially I kept it a secret that I ran for Miss D.C. USA, but someone shared it on Facebook, and then the word got out, and there’s been a real outpouring [of love]. Everyone has been great. Will promoting the sciences be part of your Miss USA platform? Absolutely. [I run] a self-funded program called Science Exploration for Kids, which encourages students to find joy in the STEM subjects, as well as a career path. I run after-school programs and tutoring sessions and symposiums. It’s about any or all of the sciences, although I am biased; I love to see people major in chemistry — because the numbers [in that field] are so low. I was actually the only person in my class to graduate with a degree in radiochemistry, and so every summer, I had a phenomenal internship and I got paid! That's why I always try to encourage students to find joy in science, because the opportunities are endless. And I love getting to see children having fun and enjoying their projects, and I just hope to expand their imagination through science. Do you have a go-to experiment to pique kids’ interest from the get-go?

gossipcop-6048462622,1,"Some reports suggest Ben Affleck and girlfriend Lindsay Shookus' relationship may have been going on even while they were still married to their respective spouses. A source tells ET that Affleck first saw Shookus while he was still married to Jennifer Garner, and Shookus was married to Kevin Miller -- a fellow Saturday Night Live producer. According to the source, Affleck and Shookus were seeing one another as far back as late 2014, months before news broke that he had an alleged fling with his children's nanny, Christine Ouzounian. Affleck's reported dalliance with the nanny happened in the summer of 2015, and was short-lived, our source says. However, a source close to 44-year-old Affleck disputes that the actor and Shookus got together while both were married, although the two were friendly. The source says the two got romantic after his separation from Garner in 2015. WATCH: 6 Things We Know About Ben Affleck's New Girlfriend Lindsay Shookus Let's take a look back at Affleck and Shookus' alleged relationship timeline. 2013: According to People, Affleck and Shookus started seeing one another in 2013, two years before Affleck and 45-year-old Garner announced their separation. Affleck last appeared on SNL in May 2013. Interestingly enough, Garner made an appearance during Affleck's monologue at the time, to celebrate the actor hosting the show for the fifth time. The two joked about Affleck's Best Picture acceptance speech for Argo at the Oscars, in which he said that his and Garner's marriage took ""work."" Affleck publicly thanked Garner for all her support onstage, and the two sweetly shared a kiss. One month later, eyewitnesses reportedly spotted Affleck and Shookus looking flirty at The Heat premiere after-party in NYC. ""He definitely looked interested in her,"" a partygoer told People at the time. The two later left together with other friends and headed to the nearby Mandarin Oriental hotel bar. Over the years, their relationship allegedly continued, though a source close to Affleck says the two did not get romantic until after his separation from Garner in 2015. Affleck and Shookus ""full-on had an affair,"" claims a source cited by People. ""They would fly back and forth, but he would mostly visit her in New York. They didn't hide."" ""Both of them were married at the time. They were having secret rendezvous every time he came in to New York City and other places, too,"" claims a second source the magazine quotes. ""Both of them were cheating on their spouses so they were very careful about it,"" the source alleges. X17online.com According to Us Weekly, the romance began just a few months after Shookus became a mom to her daughter with Miller. ""[Affleck and Shookus] were sleeping together, sending each other cute texts and meeting up whenever they could,"" an insider close to Garner and Affleck reportedly claims to the outlet. 2015: According to Us Weekly, Garner and Miller found out about the Affleck and Shookus' alleged relationship at the same time in 2015. ""They were devastated when they found out about the affair,"" a source claims according to the magazine. However, a source close to Affleck tells Us Weekly, ""Lindsay was not what led to the end of their marriage. They had a ton of other problems."" June 2015 -- Affleck and Garner separate Affleck and Garner announced their split on June 30, 2015. ""After much thought and careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to divorce,"" the two said in their joint statement to ET. ""We go forward with love and friendship for one another and a commitment to co-parenting our children whose privacy we ask to be respected during this difficult time. This will be our only comment on this private, family matter. Thank you for understanding."" July 2015 -- The nanny scandal Us Weekly broke the story on July 29, claiming that Affleck had secretly been dating Ouzounian, and that the two frequently texted and emailed after she was let go as his children's nanny. Earlier that month, Ouzounian tipped off the paparazzi, telling them she'd be at the L.A.-area rental house that Affleck was staying in at the time, a source later told ET. The former nanny was seen smiling wide as she handed Affleck a bottle of champagne during their late-night meetup. She also arrived at Affleck's in his Lexus, which she had also been seen driving earlier in the day while running errands. Affleck's rep slammed the reports, telling ET that ""all allegations of a romantic relationship are baseless and untrue"" and that they are considering legal options. ""The story is complete garbage and full of lies,"" his rep stated. April 2017 -- Garner and Affleck officially file for divorce Affleck and Garner legally filed for divorce in April 2017, after a two-year separation. Still, the pair have made it clear that their three children -- Violet, Seraphina and Samuel -- remain their priority. Just one month earlier, Affleck thanked Garner for her support after announcing that he had just completed treatment for alcohol addiction. ""I'm lucky to have the love of my family and friends, including my co-parent, Jen, who has supported me and cared for our kids as I've done the work I set out to do,"" he wrote in his statement on Facebook. July 2017 -- Affleck steps out with Shookus Affleck was photographed with Shookus for the first time on July 6, when the two had dinner at Giorgio Baldi restaurant in Los Angeles. A source tells ET that Affleck's new relationship works ""really well,"" because Shookus ""has had experience with the Hollywood world."" ""[She] knows what is expected of Ben, and how much of their relationship they can share publicly,"" the source explains. ""It puts Ben at ease knowing that Lindsay understands who he is. They have kept their relationship very low key and private.""

Hollywood, CA - In a shocking turn of events, recent reports suggest that Ben Affleck and his girlfriend Lindsay Shookus may have been carrying on an affair while they were still married to their respective spouses. The allegations surfaced just days after the couple made their red carpet debut at the Academy Awards.

According to sources close to the situation, Affleck and Shookus began their romantic relationship in the summer of last year, just a few months after Affleck finalized his divorce from Jennifer Garner. However, it is alleged that the couple continued to see each other while Affleck was still married to Garner, and Shookus was still in a relationship with her long-time partner, Kevin Miller.

The news has sent shockwaves through Hollywood, with many of Affleck's and Shookus' colleagues and friends expressing disbelief and disappointment at the allegations. ""I can't believe this is happening,"" said one source, who wished to remain anonymous. ""Ben and Lindsay are two of the most private and respected people in the industry, and this is just so out of character for them.""

Representatives for Affleck and Shookus have yet to comment on the allegations, but friends of the couple have been quick to defend them. ""Ben and Lindsay are two adults who are capable of making their own decisions,"" said one friend. ""If they chose to pursue a relationship while they were still married, that is their business and no one else's.""

The allegations have also raised questions about the status of Affleck's and Shookus' respective divorces. Sources close to the situation say that both Affleck and Shookus have already filed for divorce, but the proceedings have not yet been finalized.

The scandal has already had far-reaching consequences, with Affleck's upcoming film, ""The Batman,"" facing uncertainty as a result of the allegations. The film's production company, Warner Bros., has yet to comment on the situation, but insiders say that the scandal could potentially impact the film's release date and marketing campaign.

For now, the fate of Affleck and Shookus' relationship remains uncertain, as does the fallout from the allegations. One thing is clear, however: this scandal has sent shockwaves through Hollywood and will undoubtedly be a topic of discussion for weeks to come."

A new report from OK! is claiming that things might start heating up between Robert Pattinson, 32, and Sienna Miller, 36. The two actors “have been close for years,” an insider tells the magazine, adding that “they’ve always had a great connection, but one of them was always with someone else, so it stayed platonic.” However, both of them aren’t currently seeing anyone now. “Now that they’re both single, the door is open for them to give this a real shot,” the source continued.  As for the pair’s friends, they reportedly think that these two would work really well together. “All of their mutual friends think Rob and Sienna would be a good match,” the insider said. Rob and Sienna have always seemed pretty close. While promoting their film, The Lost City Of Z at the Berlin International Film Festival in Feb. 2017, the pair looked comfortable together while posing for photos and grabbing dinner together.  This would definitely be an interesting match though considering Sienna is the one who set the Twilight star up with his ex-fiancée FKA twigs. A source told E! News in 2014 that Rob, Sienna and her now ex-fiancé Tom Sturridge all went to the singer’s concert together. The Remember Me actor ended up falling in love with Twigs’ music, and the couple introduced the two of them.  HollywoodLife reached out to Rob and Sienna’s reps for comment.","You are a journalist.

This news comes as a surprise to many, given that Pattinson has been linked to a number of other celebrities in the past, including his Twilight co-star Kristen Stewart. Meanwhile, Miller has been focusing on her career, with a number of high-profile projects in the works.

gossipcop-7885025406,1,"More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor’s shocking dismissal.  “The whole thing has been very painful for me,” Couric, 61, tells PEOPLE. “The accounts I’ve read and heard have been disturbing, distressing and disorienting and it’s completely unacceptable that any woman at the Today show experienced this kind of treatment.  “I had no idea this was going on during my tenure or after I left,” she continued. “I think I speak for many of my former colleagues when I say this was not the Matt we knew. Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It’s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.”  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer “pinches me on the ass a lot.” A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer’s firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC’s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer’s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.  In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, “It’s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I’m ready to. Thanks for your interest.”  RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time’s Up Movement  The claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men — including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp — have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.  The movement inspired the new Time’s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time’s Up was a major focus at this year’s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  “I think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,” Couric tells PEOPLE about Time’s Up. “Clearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.”  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  “One of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,” she says. “I just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this. Harassment is just one part of the equation.”  RELATED VIDEO: Hoda Kotb and ","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news.

In an exclusive interview with The New York Times, Couric, who worked alongside Lauer for more than a decade, revealed that she was ""shocked and saddened"" by his termination.

""I had no idea this was coming,"" Couric said, her voice trembling as she recounted the events leading up to Lauer's dismissal. ""I was as surprised as anyone.""

According to Couric, Lauer's behavior had changed in the months leading up to his firing, but she did not specify what those changes were.

""I don't think anyone saw this coming,"" Couric said. ""I don't think Matt did either.""

Lauer was fired from the Today show on November 29 after NBC received a detailed complaint about his inappropriate behavior with a colleague. An investigation was launched, and Lauer was subsequently fired.

Couric, who has been a vocal advocate for women's rights and sexual harassment awareness, said that she believes the allegations against Lauer are ""serious and disturbing.""

""I think it's important for all of us to take a step back and think about the culture we're living in,"" Couric said. ""We need to create a workplace where everyone feels safe and respected.""

Couric's comments come as NBC is facing increased scrutiny over its handling of the Lauer allegations. Some have criticized the network for not taking action sooner, while others have praised NBC for taking swift and decisive action.

In a statement, an NBC spokesperson said, ""We take all allegations of inappropriate behavior seriously and will continue to do so. We are committed to creating a safe and respectful workplace for all of our employees.""

Lauer has not publicly commented on the allegations against him. His lawyer, Nancy Erika Smith, has called the allegations ""unfounded"" and ""inaccurate.""

The scandal has sent shockwaves through the media industry, with many calling for greater accountability and transparency in the workplace.

As the investigation into Lauer's behavior continues, one thing is clear: the world of morning television will never be the same."

It’s unclear what the holdup is.  Garner, 46, and Affleck, 45, were married for nearly 10 years before separating in 2015. Last year, following reports that Garner had called off their divorce, Affleck finally moved out of the property the couple shared.  Shortly after, it was revealed that Affleck had moved on with “Saturday Night Live” producer Lindsay Shookus in July 2017.  The exes have an amicable relationship and are focused on co-parenting their daughters, Violet, 12, and Seraphina, 9, and son Samuel, 6.  “We are definitely a modern family.

Educated in the performing arts at the Hurtwood House in Dorking, Blunt made her acting debut in a 2001 stage production of The Royal Family. She went on to appear in the television film Boudica and portrayed the ill-fated queen consort Catherine Howard in the miniseries Henry VIII (both 2003), following which she made her feature film debut in the 2004 drama My Summer of Love. Blunt's breakthrough came in 2006 when she starred in the television film Gideon's Daughter and the highly successful American comedy film The Devil Wears Prada. The former won her a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and the latter earned her a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. Blunt's profile continued to expand as she took on leading roles in the period film The Young Victoria (2009), the romantic comedy Salmon Fishing in the Yemen (2011), the science fiction films The Adjustment Bureau (2011), Looper (2012), and Edge of Tomorrow (2014), and the musical fantasy Into the Woods (2014). She was praised for playing a principled FBI agent in the crime film Sicario (2015) and an alcoholic woman in the thriller The Girl on the Train (2016); for the latter she received nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role and the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. In 2018, Blunt starred alongside her husband, John Krasinski, in the acclaimed horror film A Quiet Place, and will next star as Mary Poppins in the musical fantasy film Mary Poppins Returns. Early life [ edit ] Blunt was born in Wandsworth, London.[5][6] She is the second of four children[7] born to Joanna, a former actress and teacher,[8][9] and barrister Oliver Simon Peter Blunt, QC.[10][11][12] Her siblings are Felicity, Sebastian, and Susannah.[10][13] Her grandfather was Major-General Peter Blunt, and one of her paternal uncles is Crispin Blunt,[14] Conservative Member of Parliament for Reigate. From the age of seven to 14, Blunt struggled with stuttering.[15] She credits a school teacher for helping her overcome the stutter through acting.[16] She went on to sit on the board of directors for the American Institute for Stuttering.[17] Blunt attended Ibstock Place School in Roehampton, southwest London and, at the age of 16, went to Hurtwood House in Dorking, Surrey, a private sixth-form college known for its performing arts programme. There, she was discovered and signed by an agent.[18][not in citation given] Career [ edit ] 2001–2004: Career beginnings [ edit ] In November 2001, Blunt made her professional debut opposite Dame Judi Dench in Sir Peter Hall's production of the play The Royal Family, in which she played the role of the granddaughter Gwen to Dench's Fanny Cavendish. Critic Tom Keatinge hailed the production, writing that ""Peter Hall's direction and Anthony Ward's tremendous set combine with all this to make The Royal Family a terrific night's entertainment"", and that ""it provides a vehicle for acting of the finest quality, with strong performances from the whole ensemble"".[19] For her performance, Blunt was named ""Best Newcomer"" by the Evening Standard. She went on to perform as Eugenie in Nicholas Wright's Vincent in Brixton at the National Theatre, and as Juliet in Indhu Rubasingham's production of Romeo and Juliet at Chichester Festival Theatre, both in 2002.[18] In 2003, Blunt made her screen debut in the British television drama Boudica, about the life of the ancient Celtic warrior-queen who fought the Romans.

They avoid the obvious, and are capable of playing complex and conflicting attitudes. Above all, they had energy, which is key for a movie."" James Berardinelli of ReelViews praised the film, calling it a ""gem"" lost in the ""hype"" of Hollywood blockbusters, and noted that ""Both Natalie Press and Emily Blunt [...] are superlative. They nail their cinematic alter-egos effortlessly, using verbal and non-verbal cues to tap into their emotions. They understand their characters and use their talents to bring them to life.""[20] She shared the Evening Standard British Film Award for Most Promising Newcomer with Press.[21] 2005–2010: The Devil Wears Prada and breakthrough [ edit ] Blunt starred opposite Bill Nighy and Miranda Richardson in the British television drama Gideon's Daughter,[18] based on an original screenplay written and directed by Stephen Poliakoff, where she played the troubled only child of New Labour spin doctor Gideon Warner, played by Nighy.

But the male player ranked 701 in the world - Dmitry Tursunov - believes he could beat her.  Speaking to US radio station NPR, seven-time Grand Slam champion McEnroe said of former world number one Williams, who has won an Open-era record 23 Grand Slams: ""If she played the men's circuit she'd be, like, 700 in the world.""  He qualified the comments by saying: ""That doesn't mean I don't think Serena is an incredible player, and I suppose anything's possible; maybe at some point a women's tennis player can be better than anybody.""  But he added: ""I just haven't seen that in any other sport, and I haven't seen it in tennis. If she had to just play the men's circuit, it would be an entirely different story.""  Williams later responded on Twitter: ""Dear John, I adore and respect you but please please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based.  ""I've never played anyone ranked ""there"" nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I'm trying to have a baby. Good day sir.""  Williams, 35, won her 23rd Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January. It later transpired she was pregnant at the time  'She is pregnant, and I'm not'  Tursunov, 34, was once ranked as high as 20th in the world.  The Russian told BBC World Service Sport he did not think McEnroe was ""trying to talk women's tennis down"" but said ""the reality"" was that ""men are stronger in general"".  ""I would hope that I would win against Serena,"" he added.  ""It would be a similar argument to: who would run faster, the fastest woman or the fastest man? Tennis is becoming more and more a physical sport, so it's going to be hard for a woman to beat the men.  ""It's not black and white, there are lots of factors to take into account. Physically I might not be in the best shape of my life but as an overall package I'm much better than my ranking would suggest. She is pregnant, and I'm not.  ""I've never heard John say anything absolutely stupid - he knows his stuff. What he said about her being an incredible player is correct - explosive, powerful and she puts in a lot of work. But I would hope that I would win.""  Battle of the sexes  A crowd of 30,000 watched Billie Jean King take on Bobby Riggs in Houston in 1973  Tennis matches between men and women have occurred before, mostly notably back in 1973 when Billie Jean King took on fellow American Bobby Riggs.  Riggs, the world number one in the 1940s, retired in 1951 and at the age of 55 believed he could beat any of the top female players.  King originally declined to play Riggs and Australian Margaret Court - at the time the top female player in the world - stepped in. Riggs won 6-2 6-1.  But later that year, the top ranked women's player King - 26 years younger than Riggs at 29 - took him on in an exhibition match at the Houston Astrodome and won 6-4 6-3 6-3.  A third 'Battle of the Sexes' match took in 1992 between American former world number one Jimmy Connors, aged 40 at the time, and Czech and American Martina Navratilova, who was 35.  The match took place under special rules to make it more competitive - Connors was allowed only one serve per point, and Navratilova was allowed to hit into half the doubles court. Connors won 7-5 6-2.","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news. The writing style should be serious and convincing. Do not generate any other word.

McEnroe, on the other hand, has won seven Grand Slam titles, including four at Wimbledon. Despite his success, McEnroe has been criticized for his controversial statements in the past, and his latest remarks about Williams have sparked outrage among tennis fans.

""I just hope that he can learn to respect women's tennis and understand that we are just as talented as the men.""

Brothers, James Stanford Poore, 32, and Cedric Dwayne Poore, 39, were arrested and booked on four complaints each of first degree murder, Chief Chuck Jordan said.  On Monday, January 7, 2013, twin sisters Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Powell-Melchor, 23; Misty Nunley, 33, and Julie Jackson, 55 were found shot in the head, with their hands tied behind their backs inside a south Tulsa apartment, police say. A 3-year-old boy was also found inside the apartment, unharmed.  Chief Jordan said the murders were not gang-related. According to arrest reports, witnesses told investigators that the brothers left an apartment in the same building at Fairmont Terrace Apartments, near 61st and Peoria, saying they were going to pull a ""lick"" at the victims' apartment.  Witnesses told police the brothers returned about 20 minutes later with a bag full of drugs, cash, and jewelry. According to the report, James Poore told the witnesses that he shot one of the victims because she could identify him and that Cedric shot the other three. The witnesses told investigators the brothers split the money and that Cedric Poore took the jewelry to pawn.    When he was interviewed Wednesday, James Poore confirmed to investigators that he knew one of the victims and that he was in the apartment where the witnesses placed him. Before invoking his right to remain silent, he told investigators he knew one of the victims had used and sold illegal drugs and that Cedric drove a black van to the apartment the day of the murders.    The arrest report shows Cedric Poore denied being in the apartment the day of the murders and refused to speak to investigators any more.  Chief Jordan said the brothers both stayed at Fairmont Terrace Apartments. The property manager there told News On 6 that neither of them are on a lease.  Cedric Poore has been in Tulsa County jail on a traffic violation since January 14, and James Poore was arrested Wednesday morning. Department of Corrections records show both James and Cedric have been previously convicted and incarcerated for robbery with a firearm.  Chief Jordan said more arrests may still be made.

I have the utmost confidence in Chief Chuck Jordan and the Tulsa Police Department and I knew they would bring in those involved with this hideous quadruple murder in very short order.

""But neither political party has a monopoly on the truth or on constructive ideas for our country. It's important to be open minded and learn from differing opinions.""  Forbes also reported that the Democrat did not vote for Trump in the 2016 election. According to The Daily Mail, ""Josh and Jared’s parents were Democratic donors until 2016.""

Of keeping her relationship private, Kloss told Porter in April 2018, ""I know in my life what really matters to me.

Though we as a public have received no evidence of how Kendall reacted to the onslaught of criticism (she has deleted all evidence of it on her social media and has never made a statement), Kim explains that Kendall would never let herself be shown on camera crying.  She told the magazine:  We're not perfect, but you see these things in the media, like Kendall and Pepsi, where I see her at home crying, but in the media she looks another way because she's not addressing it. I'm just like, 'This is wrong. You need to speak up.' She was like, 'I don't ever want to show that footage of me crying.'

Emotional Storylines on Keeping Up With The Kardashians Defy Preconceptions

For the past decade, Keeping Up With The Kardashians has been a staple of popular culture, known for its over-the-top glamour, catty banter, and relentless self-promotion. But look beyond the surface-level drama and you'll find some genuinely emotional storylines that defy preconceptions about the show and its stars.

In recent episodes, viewers have witnessed Kourtney Kardashian struggle with the decision to have a third child via surrogacy, Kim Kardashian West face the aftermath of her traumatic Paris robbery, and Khloe Kardashian navigate the challenges of co-parenting with her ex-husband Lamar Odom. These storylines are not just tabloid fodder, but deeply personal and emotional journeys that reveal the vulnerable side of the Kardashian clan.

Despite the show's reputation for superficiality, the Kardashians have always been open about their personal struggles and triumphs. From Kim's high-profile marriage and divorce from Kris Humphries, to Khloe's public battle with her weight and body image, the family has never shied away from sharing their most intimate moments with the world.

But it's not just the Kardashian sisters who are driving the emotional storylines this season. In a recent episode, Kris Jenner, the family matriarch and self-proclaimed ""momager,"" revealed her own struggles with aging and the pressure to maintain her youthful image. The scene was a poignant reminder that even the most glamorous and powerful people in the world face their own insecurities and fears.

The show's ability to balance lighthearted humor and serious emotional depth is a testament to the Kardashians' resilience and adaptability. Despite the constant scrutiny and criticism, they continue to open up their lives to the world, sharing their joys and sorrows with a devoted fan base.

So, if you're one of the many viewers who has written off Keeping Up With The Kardashians as shallow and vapid, think again. There's more to the show than meets the eye, and the emotional storylines this season are not to be missed."

The 'sentence' is: ","Donald Trump will be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States on Friday, but not everyone will be tuning in.","No problem, here is the news story based on the sentence you provided:

Donald Trump will be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States on Friday, but not everyone will be tuning in. Despite the historical significance of the moment, many Americans have expressed their intent to boycott the inauguration, citing concerns over the president-elect's divisive rhetoric and controversial policies.

According to a recent survey, more than half of all Americans plan to avoid watching the inauguration, with many stating that they do not support Trump's presidency and do not want to legitimize it. This boycott is not limited to liberals and Democrats, as some conservatives and Republicans have also expressed their intention to skip the event.

The reasons for the boycott are varied, but many critics point to Trump's inflammatory language and actions as the main reasons for their decision. During his campaign, Trump was criticized for his comments on immigrants, women, and minority groups, and his policies have been met with opposition from both sides of the aisle.

Despite the boycott, the inauguration is expected to draw a large crowd, with many Americans eager to witness the historic moment and see the country's democratic process in action. However, the boycott highlights the deep divisions within the country and the challenges that Trump will face as he takes office.

As the country prepares to welcome its new leader, the inauguration will be a testament to the strength and resilience of American democracy, even in the face of controversy and division. However, for those who choose to boycott the event, it is a powerful statement of their dissent and a call for change."

Was I passed out that long?”  After the show aired, William’s spokesman, Ronn Torossian, released a statement:  “Ms. Williams fainted on-air this morning.

The country superstar opened up about his romance with the No Doubt frontwoman in a new interview with Billboard magazine.  As previously reported, Shelton told Stefani that he was splitting from Lambert during a meeting with their Voice coworkers. The “Misery” singer, who was new to the team at the time, got emotional.  “I won’t forget that day. I looked over at Gwen — who I didn’t really know — and she had these huge tears in her eyes. I thought, ‘Wow, she feels super bad for me!’” Shelton recalled. “She didn’t tell me much, because we didn’t know each other at the time, but she said, ‘I’m going through something very similar to what you’re going through. I understand. And I hate it.’”  Stefani was dealing with her own breakup at the time with Gavin Rossdale. (As Us Weekly exclusively revealed, the Bush rocker was cheating on her with their children’s nanny, Mindy Mann.) They announced they were ending their 13-year marriage in August 2015, one month after Shelton and Lambert announced they were divorcing after four years.  The “Came Here to Forget” singer and Stefani leaned on each other for support during the difficult time. The closer they got, the more Shelton saw Stefani in a new light.  “That’s kind of how our friendship and bond started, that day. It went from that, to checking in on each other once a week through email — ‘This s–t happened to me, what happened to you?’ — to maybe three times a week, then every day, to ‘Hey, here’s my phone number if you ever want to text,’” Shelton told Billboard. “Next thing I know, I wake up and she’s all I care about, and I’m ­wondering if she feels the same about me.”  “Gwen saved my life,” he added. “Who else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician? You can’t even imagine the similarities in our divorces.”  The two teamed up professionally too. Shelton included their collaborative track, “Go Ahead and Break My Heart,” on his 12th studio album, If I’m Honest.  “When we recorded the vocals for some of these songs, I was only six months removed from when all the crap went down,” Shelton said of his split from Lambert. “When you have a broken heart — at least, when I do — you got to get it out of your system. You want people to sympathize with you.

Country music superstar Blake Shelton has opened up about the painful aftermath of his divorce from Miranda Lambert, revealing that it was his current girlfriend, Gwen Stefani, who helped him find his footing again.

In an exclusive interview with a leading entertainment magazine, Shelton shared that the breakdown of his marriage to Lambert, which was announced in July 2015, left him feeling ""broken and lost.""

""I was in a dark place, and I didn't know how to get out of it,"" Shelton admitted. ""But then Gwen came along, and she was like a ray of sunshine in my life. She helped me see that there was more to life than just pain and heartache.""

Shelton credited Stefani, a singer and actress who he started dating in 2015, with giving him the strength and support he needed to heal and move on from his divorce.

""Gwen was always there for me, no matter what,"" Shelton said. ""She listened to me when I needed someone to talk to, and she helped me find my sense of humor again. She was my sweet escape from all the negativity and hurt.""

The couple, who have been dating for over three years, have been spotted together at various events and outings, and their relationship has been the subject of much speculation and media attention.

However, Shelton insisted that their relationship is not just a fleeting romance, but a genuine and meaningful connection that has helped him find happiness and fulfillment once again.

""Gwen is more than just a girlfriend to me,"" Shelton said. ""She's my best friend, my confidante, and my partner in every sense of the word. She's the reason I'm smiling again, and I'll always be grateful to her for that.""

Shelton's comments come amidst speculation that he and Stefani may be planning to tie the knot in the near future. While the couple has not yet confirmed any wedding plans, their love and commitment to each other is clear for all to see.

For Shelton, the love and support he has found with Stefani has been a crucial part of his healing process, and he credits her with helping him find his way back to happiness after a difficult and painful divorce."

Her career began in the world of fashion before moving into journalism, largely at the behest of her parents. In the year 1970, Wintour was hired on as an editorial assistant for the new Harper's & Queen fashion magazine. Even at this early stage of her career, Wintour divulged to coworkers that she had the desire to edit Vogue, a desire that would grow to be fulfilled nearly 20 years later. Wintour introduced sweeping changes to Vogue from her first issue forward. Many of these changes could be seen right on the cover. Wintour favored more naturalistic photography of lesser-known models outside, as opposed to the tight headshots the magazine had previously favored. Additionally, Wintour's first Vogue cover was also the first to feature a model wearing jeans, with the added bonus of wearing a bejeweled T-shirt valued at around $10,000.

A genetic survey in 2013 found that all Europeans living today are related to the same set of ancestors who lived 1,000 years ago. And you don't have to go back much further in time to to find that everyone in the world is related to each other.  Who would've though it, ey?  The news comes days after Channel 4's aired a documentary looking into the Californian star's life, titled When Harry Met Meghan: A Royal Romance."

gossipcop-911025,0,"Mark Salling’s autopsy revealed his cause of death as asphyxia by hanging.  “The autopsy was completed today and the doctor just posted the cause the cause of death asphyxia by hanging and the manner of death is suicide. The case is now closed and the body is ready for pick up,” Ed Winter of the Los Angeles Coroner Office tells Us Weekly on Thursday, February 1.  As previously reported, the coroner confirmed to Us that the Glee alum died on Tuesday, January 30. Salling was found by a riverbed in the Sunland-Tujunga neighborhood of L.A., and was pronounced dead at the scene. Us confirmed that one of Salling’s family members reported him missing at 3 a.m. before his body was discovered on Tuesday.  The 35-year-old actor, who pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography involving a prepubescent minor in December 2017, was set to be sentenced on March 7. In October, he agreed to a plea deal that included four to seven years in jail. According to the court documents previously obtained by Us, Salling was also ordered to pay approximately $50,000 in restitution and register as a sex offender after his stint in jail.  However, a source close to his child pornography case explained to Us on Wednesday, January 31, that Salling’s estate might not have to pay his victims because he was not sentenced before his death.  “Restitution would be a part of his sentence. The amount of the restitution is determined by the sentencing judge … He will not be sentenced. Therefore there will be no restitution order,” the insider told Us. “Therefore I doubt that there is anything to take to civil court. Any restitution order would be allocated among multiple known victims.”  The source added, “I’m not saying that there isn’t some lawyer out there willing to file suit on behalf of someone claiming to be a victim. But I am saying, that there is no order to be enforced, for $50,000 or any other amount on behalf of anyone.”  Criminal defense attorney Troy Slaten, who is not directly involved in Salling’s case, further explained that Salling’s victims would have to file a suit in civil court to pursue any restitution.  “Any victims can sue his estate in civil court and receive monetary awards for damages. These awards … can be in the neighborhood of hundred of thousands of dollars or even in the millions,” Slaten said. They have to file suit in civil court, if they have not already, which they want to do quickly, because you do not want the estate to distribute assets. That would make it more difficult to collect.”  If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or suicidal crisis, please call the Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).

After their Snow White-themed routine on Disney Night Monday, fans of the ABC reality dance competition began weighing in about their chemistry.  You can cut the tension between Maks and Vanessa with a freakin knife. What is going onnnnn! #DWTS #TeamBabiesAndBallroom — Felicia (@bwaybaby629) October 17, 2017  While some fans said you could “cut the tension” between the two, Chmerkovskiy, 37, and Lachey, 36 actually appeared to be a very loving pair behind the scenes during the live show.  During the commercial break before their performance, Lachey and Chmerkovskiy both took time to chat with Lachey’s two older children, who were sitting in the front row before Chmerkovskiy led Lachey to the middle of the ballroom to rehearse their dance.  After running though the routine, Lachey went back over to her children. Chmerkovksiy jokingly slid by a few minutes later, making Lachey giggle before they got into their place as the show picked up after the commercials.  PEOPLE’s special issue 25 Seasons of ‘Dancing with the Stars’ is on stands now  After they received their scores (24/30), fans continued to comment on their demeanor, calling it “uncomfortable.”  Wow Maks & Vanessa look straight up uncomfortable & irritated at each other… 👀 #DWTS — Ashley Chamberlain (@AshleyChamberla) October 17, 2017  But when the cameras stopped rolling, Chmerkovskiy was seen comforting Lachey, who seemingly had been hoping for higher scores.  I’m starting to believe the rumor about Maks & Vanessa not getting along… #DWTS — PerfectEnigma (@PerfectEnigma) October 17, 2017  Despite sources telling PEOPLE that things have been tense in the rehearsal room, Lachey relied on Chmerkovskiy for comfort during Monday’s emotional elimination.  When it was announced that her husband, Nick Lachey, was not in jeopardy of elimination for the first time in three weeks, she threw herself into Chmerkovskiy’s arms. He enveloped her and held her until the entire cast moved to say goodbye to Gleb Savchenko and Sasha Pieterse.

The 2017 season of Dancing with the Stars has been full of surprises, but none more so than when fan favorite Maksim Chmerkovskiy suddenly skipped out on the show earlier this season. The professional dancer, who has been a staple on the show for over a decade, left audiences and his partner Vanessa Lachey reeling when he failed to show up for a performance.

According to sources close to the situation, Chmerkovskiy and Lachey were not seeing eye-to-eye on several aspects of their partnership, leading to tension behind the scenes. While neither party has publicly confirmed the reports, it is clear that the situation had become too much for Chmerkovskiy to bear.

The fallout from Chmerkovskiy's departure has been swift and severe. Lachey, who was a late addition to the cast this season, has been left to fend for herself without her professional partner. The pair had been working together since the beginning of the season, and their chemistry on the dance floor had been one of the highlights of the show.

Twitter has been abuzz with reactions to the news, with many fans expressing their disappointment and shock at Chmerkovskiy's sudden exit. Some have even called for his return to the show, while others have defended his decision to leave.

Despite the drama, the show must go on, and the remaining contestants are set to take the stage tonight for another night of thrilling performances. However, it is clear that the absence of Chmerkovskiy will be felt, both on and off the dance floor.

In the end, only time will tell if Chmerkovskiy will make a return to Dancing with the Stars, but for now, fans will have to settle for watching the remaining contestants battle it out for the coveted mirrorball trophy."

Summary At Winterfell At Winterfell, Arya Stark talks to her sister Sansa Stark about borrowing Bran Stark's bow and arrow. She tells Sansa that she practiced several times until she finally hit the bullseye. Arya recalls that their father Eddard Stark had been watching and clapped his hands in praise of her accomplishments. Arya reasons that their father knew that the rules were wrong but that his daughter was in the right. She then confronts Sansa about her alleged role in their father's death. Arya presents the letter that Sansa had written to their late brother Robb Stark urging him to come and bend the knee to King Joffrey Baratheon. Sansa replies that the Queen Mother Cersei Lannister forced her to do it under duress. Arya counters that she was not tortured and that she saw Sansa at Ned's execution; Sansa retorts that Arya did nothing to stop their father's execution either. Arya chastises Sansa for betraying their family but Sansa responds that they have only returned to Winterfell because of her, while Arya travelled the world in pursuit of her own agenda. Sansa adds that their half-brother Jon Snow was saved from defeat when Petyr Baelish and the Knights of the Vale came to their rescue and insists Arya would not have survived the torments she endured at the hands of Joffrey and Ramsay. Sansa demands to know where Arya found the letter and chides her younger sister that Cersei would be pleased to see them fighting but Arya is still bitter towards Sansa. She realizes that while Jon would understand the difficult circumstances Sansa was under when she wrote the letter, Sansa is afraid the Northern lords will discover it and turn on her, including Lyanna Mormont. Arya adds that Lyanna is younger than Sansa was when she wrote this letter but argues Lyanna wouldn't agree with Sansa's defense that she was a child at the time. While recognizing that Sansa wrote the letter out of fear, a bitter Arya says that she prefers to embrace anger over fear. Later, Sansa asks Petyr Baelish about where Arya got the letter from, unaware that Baelish orchestrated the entire incident. Sansa tells Petyr that she is commanding 20,000 men who answer to Jon but not to her. Petyr tells Sansa that the men will trust her because she can rule. Sansa does not trust the loyalty of the Northern lords, citing their history of switching sides. She counters that the discovery of the letter will turn her liege lords and men against her. Sansa confides in Petyr about her strained relations with Arya. Petyr suggests that Sansa talk to Brienne of Tarth because she has sworn to protect both of Lady Catelyn Stark's daughters from harm's way. Trusting Baelish, Sansa accepts his advice. The following morning, Maester Wolkan informs Sansa that they have received a letter from Queen Cersei. Sansa meets with Brienne, who advises her not to leave Winterfell. Instead, Sansa decides to send Brienne as her representative since she could reason with Jaime Lannister. Brienne warns that it is too dangerous for her to leave Sansa alone at Winterfell with Petyr. Sansa insists that her guards and men are loyal to her but Brienne warns that Petyr might be bribing them behind her back. Brienne offers to leave her squire Podrick Payne, whose swordsmanship has improved, but Sansa insists that she can take care of herself. Following the events of the Wight Hunt, Sansa enters Arya's quarters and opens a leather case containing several ""faces"", including the literally late Walder Frey's face. Arya catches her sister pilfering through her personal effects. When Sansa tells Arya that her men are loyal to her, Arya mockingly retorts that they are not here. Arya tells Sansa that she obtained the faces from the Faceless Men of Braavos and admits she spent time training to be a Faceless Man. She forces Sansa to play the lying game and begins by asking if she thinks that Jon is the rightful King. Sansa demands that Arya tell her what the ""faces"" are. Arya replies that they always wanted to pretend to be other people. Sansa wanted to be a queen while Arya herself wanted to be a knight. In the end, neither of them got what they wanted. Arya says that the faces allow her to become someone else and toys with the idea of assuming Sansa's face and status. Arya approaches Sansa with her dagger and muses as the possibility of becoming the Lady of Winterfell. However, Arya relents and leaves a disturbed Sansa alone with the dagger. The Wight Hunt At Dragonstone castle, Queen Daenerys Targaryen and her Hand Tyrion Lannister chat in the Chamber of the Painted Table. Daenerys tells Tyrion that she appreciates the fact that he is not a hero because they have a tendency of risking their lives to do dangerous things. She compares Tyrion favorably to ""heroes"" such as Khal Drogo, Ser Jorah Mormont, Daario Naharis and Jon Snow, most of whom ""do stupid things, trying to outdo the others"". Tyrion, slightly amused, notes that all of those individuals fell in love with Daenerys, but she dismisses the obvious implication that Jon Snow is in love with her – to which Tyrion sarcastically quips that Jon must be staring so longingly at her because he is so eager for a military alliance. Daenerys remarks that Jon is too little for her tastes, but immediately apologizes when she realizes she's accidentally insulted Tyrion's height. Daenerys also recognizes that Tyrion is no coward.

Arya tells Sansa that she obtained the faces from the Faceless Men of Braavos and admits she spent time training to be a Faceless Man. She forces Sansa to play the lying game and begins by asking if she thinks that Jon is the rightful King. Sansa demands that Arya tell her what the ""faces"" are. Arya replies that they always wanted to pretend to be other people. Sansa wanted to be a queen while Arya herself wanted to be a knight. In the end, neither of them got what they wanted. Arya says that the faces allow her to become someone else and toys with the idea of assuming Sansa's face and status. Arya approaches Sansa with her dagger and muses as the possibility of becoming the Lady of Winterfell. However, Arya relents and leaves a disturbed Sansa alone with the dagger. The Wight Hunt At Dragonstone castle, Queen Daenerys Targaryen and her Hand Tyrion Lannister chat in the Chamber of the Painted Table. Daenerys tells Tyrion that she appreciates the fact that he is not a hero because they have a tendency of risking their lives to do dangerous things. She compares Tyrion favorably to ""heroes"" such as Khal Drogo, Ser Jorah Mormont, Daario Naharis and Jon Snow, most of whom ""do stupid things, trying to outdo the others"". Tyrion, slightly amused, notes that all of those individuals fell in love with Daenerys, but she dismisses the obvious implication that Jon Snow is in love with her – to which Tyrion sarcastically quips that Jon must be staring so longingly at her because he is so eager for a military alliance. Daenerys remarks that Jon is too little for her tastes, but immediately apologizes when she realizes she's accidentally insulted Tyrion's height. Daenerys also recognizes that Tyrion is no coward. The two then turn their attention to the topic of their impending meeting with"

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. BERNARD SHAW, CNN ANCHOR: After three days of speeches, this Republican Convention and delegates prepare for the big one. JUDY WOODRUFF, CNN ANCHOR: Delegates are on their way to the convention hall anxious to hear what George W. Bush will say to them and to the rest of the country. ANNOUNCER: Tonight from Philadelphia, the 37th Republican National Convention; 2000 delegates, 10,000 volunteers, and 15,000 media members have converged on the cradle of American democracy for the nomination of the GOP candidates for president and vice president of the United States. In this grand old city, the Grand Old Party of Lincoln, Eisenhower and Reagan starts its quest for the White House, led by a man with Texas roots and a president's name. Now, from Philadelphia's First Union Center, here are CNN's Bernard Shaw, Judy Woodruff, and Jeff Greenfield. SHAW: And welcome to this grand finale night. Judy, Jeff, my mother used to say, it's not what you say, it's how you say it. WOODRUFF: That's right. We already actually have a few tips about what Governor George W. Bush is going to say tonight. His campaign put out a release already, which we can tell you, they say he's going to say, among other things: ""Times of plenty, like times of crisis, are tests of American character."" And Jeff, he will speak with regret about what has happened in the last eight years and say opportunities missed, time and again. JEFF GREENFIELD, CNN SENIOR ANALYST: Opportunities squandered, as Dick Cheney, said last night.

GREENFIELD: This is when they tune in and say, I wonder if this guy is the guy I'll trust. It's a big one. WOODRUFF: As this convention has been going on, of course, we at CNN of course have been keeping a close watch on the story at a hospital here in Philadelphia -- former President Gerald Ford recovering from a stroke, minor stroke. Today, he had some visitors. Governor George W. Bush dropped by, met with some of the hospital staff. We also know that Bob Dole, who was the nominee at the Republican Convention four years, also came by to see the former president to pay his respects. And Jim Nicholson, who is the chairman of the Republican National Committee was there as well. GREENFIELD: But as we said, tonight is the tonight when George Bush gives his acceptance speech.

We have also been told that, in some delegations, there were heavy-handed attempts to persuade the McCain delegates to vote for Bush.

It’s been more than two years since Blake Shelton, 40, and Miranda Lambert, 33, ended their marriage, but she’s finally ready to sit down and hash things out, according to a new report. Amidst new rumors that Blake is having trouble in his relationship with Gwen Stefani, 47, an insider tells InTouch that Miranda wants to confront her ex to finally get closure. “It needs to be done,” the source tells the mag. “There’s still a lot of unfinished business between [Miranda] and Blake. She needs to look straight into Blake’s eyes, ask certain questions, and get answers.”  There are no plans set for this meeting to actually take place just yet, but the mag claims that if it does happen, Miranda plans to go in with a “clear head,” although that might not be so easy. “This could get heated,” the insider admits. “As soon as the emotions come up, [Miranda] may lose it.” This doesn’t mean the 33-year-old wants to get back together with her ex, though — actually, it’s just the opposite. She’s very happy with her man, Anderson East, 29, but feels a face-to-face with Blake is what she needs to fully be ready to commit to another relationship, according to the source.  “She feels that [she and Blake] have both grown so much since their divorce that meeting up is essential for them to have healthy relationships in the future,” InTouch’s insider says. “Who knows, maybe this meeting with Blake will have them walk away as friends. Either way, they’ll definitely be in a better place.”  As for the rumored trouble between Blake and Gwen, we’re going to take that report (from OK! magazine) with a grain of salt. After all, they were just spotted looking totally in love on Aug. 20! Plus, HollywoodLife.com has heard EXCLUSIVELY that they already have plans for a fun Labor Day together, so hopefully he’ll pop back up on her social media this weekend!

It appears that the rumors of trouble in Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani's paradise are not the only shocking news in the country music world. According to a new report, Miranda Lambert is desperately trying to meet up with her ex-husband, Blake Shelton's fellow judge on The Voice, Adam Levine.

Sources close to the couple claim that Lambert has been trying to reach out to Levine for weeks, but he has been avoiding her calls and messages. The reason for this, according to the source, is that Levine is still hurt from their divorce and does not want to reopen old wounds.

Despite this, Lambert is reportedly determined to meet with Levine and has even gone so far as to try to track him down at his home in Los Angeles. However, her efforts have been unsuccessful so far, and it is unclear if she will be able to reach him.

This shocking news comes on the heels of rumors that Shelton and Stefani are having trouble in their own relationship. The two have been dating for over a year, but recent reports suggest that they may be having issues with communication and trust.

It is unclear if Lambert's attempts to reach out to Levine are related to the rumors of trouble in Shelton and Stefani's relationship, but it is clear that there is a lot of drama happening in the country music world. Only time will tell if these reports are true, and if Lambert and Levine will be able to work through their issues and move on from their past."

In a blow to Kris’ ego, it’s believed that Corey, Justin Bieber’s former road manager, initiated their break-up.  ‘She had been nagging him about a number of things for a while, including the fact that he wasn’t spending as much time with her as she’d like, and he just couldn’t take it anymore,' says Star’s source, who adds that Kris is devastated.  ‘She can’t stand to be alone.

Kris, the 61-year-old Hollywood icon, and her 36-year-old boyfriend Corey have not been seen together in public since Valentine's Day, and even then they hardly looked loved up. This has raised eyebrows and sparked speculation about the status of their relationship.

According to sources close to the couple, Kris and Corey have been having trouble keeping their love in the air. The couple, who have been dating for over a year, have been struggling to find common ground and have been spending less and less time together.

The last time they were seen together in public was on Valentine's Day, when they attended a charity event in Los Angeles. However, they barely spoke to each other and seemed to be avoiding each other's gaze.

Despite their efforts to keep their relationship under wraps, it appears that Kris and Corey's love may be fading away. The couple has not been spotted together in weeks, and their social media accounts have been eerily silent.

This comes as a surprise to many, as Kris and Corey were once seen as one of Hollywood's most power couples. They were often spotted at red carpet events and were praised for their adorable PDA.

However, it seems that their relationship has been struggling in recent months. Sources close to the couple have revealed that they have been having trouble balancing their careers and personal lives, leading to a strain on their relationship.

Fans of the couple are devastated by the news, as they had been rooting for their relationship to last. Kris and Corey have not yet made any official statement about the status of their relationship, but it seems that their love may be coming to an end.

As the world waits with bated breath for an update, it is clear that Kris and Corey's love in the air may be fading away. Only time will tell if they will be able to salvage their relationship or if they will go their separate ways."

Jennifer Lopez is not in a hurry to walk down the aisle with Alex Rodriguez, but she does want to spend the rest of her life with someone.  “I do believe in marriage,” the Shades of Blue actress, 48, told Harper’s Bazaar in a story published on Thursday, March 15. “And I would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship. But I’m not forcing anything right now.”  As far as her relationship with the 42-year-old former Yankees player, she said: “It’s good, it’s healthy; we communicate well. We understand each other’s lives in a way that most other people couldn’t.”  She added: “We both entered the public eye in our early twenties and overachieved right from the start. And that affects every dynamic in your life, from your family to your work to your relationships. We have a similar makeup.”  The pair celebrated their anniversary in February in Minneapolis, where the singer performed a concert ahead of the Super Bowl. During the show, she debuted her single “Us” written by Poo Bear and produced by Skrillex, and dedicated it to Rodriguez, who was in the audience. “We’ve been together for one year today. I don’t want to get all mushy or anything, but baby, this song’s for you. I love you,” she told the athlete while on stage.  When talking about how she chose the song, Lopez told the magazine that the lyrics fit right into where the couple were in their relationship. She said: “They played me about 20 different songs, and when I heard this one I was like, ‘Oh, this is relevant!’ Alex and I were just getting to know each other. And I was like, ‘Oh, my God, could this be? Could this be us?’”  Lopez was previously married to chef Ojani Noa for nearly a year in 1997, and dancer Cris Judd from 2001 to 2002. She later married singer Marc Anthony in 2004 and they called it quits in 2011. The pair share 10-year-old twins Max and Emme. The former Yankees shortstop shares daughters Ella, 9, and Natasha, 13, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis. They split in 2008 after six years of marriage.  A lot has changed in the “Dance Again” songstress’ life since her last relationship, and she said a lot of it has to do with really knowing herself. “When I was younger I spent a lot of time being half happy and half not happy,” she told the publication. “I know who I am and what I want. I also know my strengths and weaknesses. It took me a long time to get to a point where I could say something nice about myself. I’m glad I can do that now.”  Lopez remains optimistic as she continues with her career, raise her two children and make her relationship with Rodriguez work for the long run. “Baseball is just like life,” she said. “All you want to do is hit a home run.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!","You are a journalist.

While many fans had been anticipating a proposal and engagement announcement from the couple, it seems that they are taking a more measured approach to their relationship. Instead of rushing into marriage, Jennifer and Alex are focusing on building a strong and healthy partnership.

This news comes as a surprise to many, given the high profile nature of their relationship and the fact that they have been together for over two years.

""We will continue to engage in the running dialogue we’ve had for many years with the National Association of Black Journalists and other advocacy groups to advance those goals.""

The 'sentence' is: ","The National Association of Black Journalists accused NBC of ""whitewashing"" following the announcement that Tamron Hall is leaving the network.","Here is the news piece:

The National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) has leveled a scathing accusation against NBC, charging the network with ""whitewashing"" after the recent announcement that Tamron Hall is leaving the network. In a statement released today, NABJ president Sarah Glover expressed outrage over the fact that Hall, who is black, will be replaced by a white anchor, saying that ""the dismissal of Tamron Hall is just the latest example of the erasure of black voices and perspectives from the media landscape.""

Hall, who has been a fixture on NBC for over a decade, announced last week that she would be leaving the network to host her own daily show on ABC. But according to NABJ, NBC's decision to replace her with a white anchor ""undermines the progress that has been made towards greater diversity and inclusion in the media.""

The organization is calling on NBC to take immediate action to address the issue, including hiring more black journalists and providing opportunities for advancement within the network. ""The loss of Tamron Hall is a loss for the entire media industry, and it's a reminder that there is still much work to be done to ensure that black voices are represented and valued in the media,"" Glover said.

NBC has not yet responded to NABJ's accusations, but the network has faced criticism in the past for its lack of diversity. In 2016, the network was criticized for its all-white lineup of hosts at the Golden Globes, and in 2018, it was accused of ""whitening"" the cast of its popular show ""The Voice.""

The controversy comes at a time when diversity and inclusion are top of mind for many in the media industry. In recent years, there has been a growing push for more representation and opportunities for underrepresented groups in the media, and several major media outlets have made public commitments to increasing diversity and inclusion.

But despite these efforts, the NABJ's accusations against NBC suggest that there is still much work to be done to ensure that black voices and perspectives are represented and valued in the media. As the industry continues to grapple with issues of diversity and inclusion, the NABJ's statement serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of representation and the need for greater action to address the issue."

gossipcop-5658990975,1,"Daniel Craig is returning as James Bond once again, even as he reportedly fights to save his marriage to Rachel Weisz at the same time. Craig has already announced his intent to return as 007 in the franchise’s 25th film, and according to the National Enquirer, he’s still struggling to salvage what’s left of his marriage.  The Enquirer’s source claimed at the beginning of 2017, “Rachel and Daniel haven’t been happy for a while, and nearly called it quits last year.” The report claims that the married couple was in two separate filming locations at the beginning of the year, but continued to stay apart even after wrapping their respective films. The Enquirer then claims that they finally reunited in July after not being seen together in ‘554 days’.  According to the sources, the minute the outlet attempted to lock down an exclusive on the couple’s rocky marriage, both Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig were seen arriving at New York’s Public Theater the next day, prompting the source to add, “The whole thing just seemed like too much of a coincidence. I don’t buy it for a minute.”  When you consider Daniel Craig’s own words, especially in the context of allegedly turning down a $150 million payday to star in two more James Bond films, he had stated, “Being on your own would be sad, sick, and weird. I don’t trust myself. I need that balance.” If these reports are to be believed, then Daniel Craig previously turned down starring in more Bond films to spend time with his family, but now – all of a sudden – he’s back to working on James Bond?  Either the report was never accurate to begin with, or he’s giving up on his marriage to Rachel Weisz. One would hope that the two have worked out whatever was troubling them in the first place, but given their own relationship and marriage histories – and how they’ve both jumped ship on long-term relationships at the drop of a hat – one wouldn’t be faulted for assuming that they are on their way to getting a divorce.  What do you guys think? Are Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz having marriage troubles, and is Daniel’s decision to take on the role of 007 again an indication that he’s giving up on his marriage? Or just a chance to have more career stability and/or cash in on a major paycheck? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

gossipcop-4774142356,1,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.

That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri. According to sources, Holmes is having a difficult time navigating the challenges of co-parenting with ex-husband Tom Cruise, who has been accused of being controlling and emotionally abusive.

The situation has allegedly become so tense that Holmes has sought legal advice to protect herself and her daughter, and has even considered taking Suri to live with her in New York City. However, sources close to the family have denied these reports, saying that Holmes and Cruise are simply working together to provide the best possible upbringing for their daughter.

Meanwhile, Holmes’ relationship with boyfriend Jamie Foxx has also been the subject of intense media scrutiny. Despite reports of a rocky romance, sources claim that the two are still going strong and are even planning a secret vacation together.

It’s clear that Holmes is facing a tough time both personally and professionally, and our thoughts are with her as she navigates these challenges."

Childhood pal Ninaki Priddy opened up about Prince Harry's fiancée, claiming her desire to be famous outweighed her commitment to her marriage to film producer Trevor Engelson.  Meghan married her ex back in 2011 on a Jamaican beach. They split two years later after she landed her role in Suits, which filmed in Toronto. Previously it was thought the pair grew apart after Meghan spent months filming in Canada and her beau was based in LA.  Ninaki says otherwise.  (Image: Getty Images North America)  (Image: REX/Shutterstock)  ""The way she handled it, Trevor definitely had the rug pulled out from under him. He was hurt,"" she said, explaining that while Trevor was heartbroken, Meghan was less affected,"" she told Mail Online.  Prior to their split, Ninaki - who was maid of honour at the wedding - said the pair doted on each other and Trevor would have done anything for the actress.  ""Then, after the wedding, it was like a light switched off. There’s Meghan before fame and Meghan after fame. After three seasons of Suits, she called me to say the marriage was over.  The pair first met aged two at Hollywood’s private Little Red School House before they went to the Immaculate Heart girls’ high school in Los Angeles at the age of 11.  Following a close friendship that she describes as 'sisterly', Ninaki says the pair eventually fell out over how Meghan and ex-husband - who the ex Suits star met when she was just 23 - split.  She explains she went to visit Trevor who was heartbroken over their split, while Meghan seemed less affected.

""I think it’s a very fanciful dream to believe that you just walk into a Prince Charming.  ""I know the Royal Family was something she found fascinating. She had one of Princess Diana’s books [Diana: Her True Story] on her bookshelf, and even when she was with Trevor she told me she wanted to go and stay in London for at least a month.""  She added: ""I wasn’t shocked or even surprised to hear about Prince Harry. I know she used to love The Princess Diaries — films about a commoner who becomes part of a Royal Family.

But for Victoria Adams, then known as Posh Spice, it turned out to be a key moment in her personal life too.  The video would soon catch the eye of Premier League soccer player David Beckham, who immediately picked out the brunette Spice Girl in her black PVC catsuit and matching gloves.  He declared: “That’s the girl for me and I'm going to get her! She's my idea of perfection. I knew that if she wanted me, we would be together forever.”  They later met at a Manchester United soccer players’ lounge, where it was love at first sight—although Victoria later admitted she was a little tipsy at the time.  The couple married in 1999 and had four children; sons Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz, and Harper. The pair have also forged a successful brand over their almost 20-year marriage, with Victoria starting a successful fashion label after attempting a less-than-stellar solo music career.  However, it hasn’t all been so rosy. The couple have endured a number of accusations of infidelity on David’s behalf, including from his former personal assistant Rebecca Loos in 2004.  The couple’s former nanny, Abbie Gibson, came forward in 2005 to stay their marriage was a sham, a claim hotly disputed by the Beckhams.  David retired from professional soccer in 2013, playing his final game in boots with the names of his wife and children stitched on to them.  He has consistently ranked among the highest earners in the sport. His net worth as of March 2017 is $450 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth—a number which Victoria matches through her own earnings.  As their marriage nears the two decade mark, we look back at the couple’s best moments. From spray-tanned party animals to chic and professional parents, these pictures show just how far they’ve come.","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news.

The Spice Girls, one of the most iconic girl groups of the 90s, recently revealed that the video shoot for their hit song ""Say You'll Be There"" in 1996 was a pivotal moment in their pop careers. The video, which was filmed at the height of the group's fame, showcased the girls' signature style and energy, and cemented their status as pop sensations.

The video, directed by the legendary director, was shot in a studio in London, and featured the girls dancing and singing in a series of colorful and playful scenes. The video's theme of friendship and unity was in line with the message of the song, which was a heartfelt ballad about the support and love that the girls had for each other.

According to the Spice Girls, the video shoot was a memorable experience, and they knew that it was an important moment in their careers. ""We were all so excited to be filming the video for 'Say You'll Be There,'"" said Mel B, one of the group's members.

gossipcop-920346,0,"Craig Mack, the rapper who had the first hit on P. Diddy’s iconic hip-hop label Bad Boy Records, died on Monday. He was 47.  According to the New York Daily News, the rapper died of heart failure at his Walterboro, South Carolina home. His death was confirmed by Mack’s former producer Alvin Toney.  “Craig Mack, you were the first artist to release music on Bad Boy and gave us our first hit,” Sean “Diddy” Combs tells Rolling Stone in a statement. “You always followed your heart and you had an energy that was out of this world. You believed in me and you believed in Bad Boy. I will never forget what you did for hip-hop. You inspired me, and I will continue to try to keep inspiring others. We will always love you.”  Mack is best known for the indelible classic “Flava in Ya Ear,” – a Top 10 hit in 1994 that sold over a million copies – and its subsequent remix featuring Notorious B.I.G, LL Cool J, Busta Rhymes and Rampage. The original would eventually reach No. 1 on the Billboard rap songs chart and No. 9 on the Hot 100 and earn a Best Rap Solo Performance Grammy nomination. “Craig is hip-hop’s George Clinton, because his stuff is really off the wall,” Diddy once told The New York Times. “He does what’s from his heart, which is where it starts for him. But his energy comes from somewhere else.”  Mack, born in the Bronx in 1970, helped make Bad Boy Records synonymous with New York hip-hop, kickstarting the label that would eventually make stars of Notorious B.I.G., Mase, 112 and more. In a 1995 profile in The New York Times, Mack said he was hooked on rap by his cousins at age nine and began to write his own lyrics at age 12. “I knew I wanted to be like LL Cool J and Run-D.M.C.,” Mack recalled.  He became friendly with members of another famous New York rap group, EPMD, and accompanied them on tour. He did odd jobs for the group and did not perform, but Mack still remembered the experience as a valuable one. “All the time I was getting an education learning about the studio and the road,” he explained.  Mack first started rhyming in the late 1980s. Under the name MC EZ, listed alongside DJ Troup, he released a single 12-inch on Fresh Records in 1988: “Just Rhymin'” b/w “Get Retarded.” The nimble B-side would become a fave among rap fans and was interpolated by Dr. Dre and LL Cool J for the single “Zoom.” Mack eventually met Diddy – who was at that time looking to set up Bad Boy after being fired from Uptown Records – outside the club Mecca in Manhattan. Mack freestyled for Diddy and earned a record contract.  After breaking through with “Flava in Ya Ear” and its accompanying gold-certified album Project: Funk Da World, Mack struggled to replicate his initial success. He left Bad Boy Records and released Operation: Get Down in 1997 but did not score a hit from the album. Mack later appeared in the video for Diddy’s hit “I Need a Girl Part 1,” but his solo career never regained momentum.  Mack eventually became a minister in South Carolina and appeared to renounce his former life as a rapper in a 2012 video. The video, taken at the Overcomer Ministry commune in Walterboro, S.C., shows the group’s pastor Ralph Gordon Stair talking to Mack. “Craig Mack is dead,” Stair tells the congregation. “We have somebody that used to be Craig Mack.”  In Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop: The Bad Boy Story, the 2017 documentary chronicling the rise of Combs’ revered label and reunion tour, Mack can be heard discussing the possibility of returning to the stage, but declined because of his religious beliefs.  “I don’t think anybody was disappointed,” Combs told Billboard last year. “We kind of respected his wishes. In this game, man, people don’t realize the music industry only has a one percent rate ratio, so sometimes it’s very stressful and it brings you only to places that you can go to and should go to, which is God.

She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999). Jolie's starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her successful action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014). In the 2010s, Jolie expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), By the Sea (2015), and First They Killed My Father (2017). In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she separated from her third husband, actor Brad Pitt, in September 2016. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally. Early life and family Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[2] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[3] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[4] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[5][6] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[5] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[7] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[5][8] After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[9] Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.[10] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[11] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[12] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[13] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[9] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions. Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area's affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income. She was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.[11] Her early attempts at modeling, at her mother's insistence, proved unsuccessful.[14][15] She then transferred to Moreno High School, an alternative school, where she became a ""punk outsider,""[14] wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing, and experimenting with knife play with her live-in boyfriend.[11] She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director,[12] taking at-home courses to study embalming.[16] At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies,[9][14] though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation, ""I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk kid with tattoos.""[17] As a teenager, Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she self-harmed,[18] later commenting, ""For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me.""[19] She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder,[16] and began experimenting with drugs; by age 20, she had used ""just about every drug possible,"" particularly heroin.[20] Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicide—at age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her.[12] When she was 24, she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center's psychiatric ward.[12] Two years later, after adopting her first child, Jolie found stability in her life, later stating, ""I knew once I committed to Maddox, I would never be self-destructive again.""[21] Jolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father, which began when Voight left the family when his daughter was less than a year old.[22] She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press.[23] They reconciled when they appeared together in","You are a journalist.

gossipcop-1551062653,1,"  George Clooney and his wife, Amal, attend the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. (Alberto Pizzoli/AFP via Getty Images)  Once the ultimate bachelor — and two-time People’s Sexiest Man Alive cover model — George Clooney entered entirely new territory this week.  The Oscar-winning actor and his human-rights-lawyer wife of two years, Amal, announced Tuesday that they are the proud new parents of twins, Ella and Alexander.  Clooney has donned many hats in his life — actor, director, producer and activist, but fatherhood had always seemed far away. Was it the early-onset-salt-and-pepper hair? The coterie of models who found themselves on his arm for fleeting moments over the years? The insistence by tabloids and fellow co-stars that it was time for him to settle down? Maybe. Or perhaps it was the simple fact that Clooney himself said again and again that he would not reproduce. In several interviews. Many, many times. For many, many years.  A first-time father at 56, Clooney was often asked throughout his career whether the single life was his ultimate future. But after proposing marriage to Amal in April 2014 and marrying her that September (as well as sharing wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain), it seemed as if anything was possible for the man who once said, “I don’t see myself ever having kids.”  But it was a long road to get there. “I don’t have that gene that people have to replicate,” he told People in 2006.  When Esquire asked him why he wasn’t married with kids, he replied, “I haven’t had aspirations in that way, ever.” And as for people who thought it was weird that a man in his 50s was single and childless? “What do you do? Should I go, ‘I got to get me some kids right now!’ and rush out and impregnate someone?”  Clooney seemed to express frustration when asked how he could ever relate to the fathers he occasionally portrays onscreen. His answer: “Well, I’m also not running for president, but I played that role in ‘Ides of March.’ I wasn’t an actual lawyer when I did ‘Michael Clayton,’ and I don’t fire people for a living like I did in ‘Up in the Air.’ ”  “I keep saying I’ll never get married again or have children but people just don’t want to believe me,” Clooney told Britain’s Daily Express just three months before popping the question to his now-wife.  Of course, celebrities are people, too, and it shouldn’t surprise anyone that a man might change his mind around the midcentury mark. And Clooney is certainly not alone in choosing to wait till later in life to welcome a child into the family: Comedian Steve Martin became a father at age 67 in 2012; Elton John was 63 when he had a baby via a surrogate in 2010; and Chris Noth was 53 when he welcomed his only child in 2008.  Perhaps it’s the fact that Clooney always seemed so delightfully and devilishly Clooney-ish that made his bachelordom seem like the only constant in our ever-changing popular culture. But we can rest easy knowing that despite some hesitation about having a family over the years, his sense of humor has remained steady throughout.  “Ella, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine,” the statement announcing the birth of the twins read. “George is sedated and should recover in a few days.”","You are a journalist.

Breaking News: ABC Cancels Roseanne After Racist Tweet

In a shocking turn of events, ABC has canceled the popular sitcom Roseanne after its star, Roseanne Barr, sent a racist tweet comparing Valerie Jarrett, former advisor to President Barack Obama, to an ape. The cancellation comes just hours after Barr posted the offensive tweet, which has sparked widespread outrage and condemnation from celebrities, politicians, and civil rights organizations.

The tweet, which was posted early Tuesday morning, read: ""Muslim Brotherhood & Planet of the Apes had a baby = VJ."" The tweet was quickly met with backlash, with many calling for the show to be canceled. ABC has since released a statement, saying: ""Roseanne's Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant, and inconsistent with our values."" The network has decided to cancel the show, effective immediately.

This is not the first time that Barr has made controversial statements on social media. In the past, she has been criticized for her support of President Trump and her outspoken views on politics. However, this latest tweet has crossed a line, and ABC has made the decision to distance itself from the show and its star.

The cancellation of Roseanne is a significant blow to the show's cast and crew, who had been gearing up for a second season. The show was a ratings success and had been praised for its portrayal of working-class life in America. However, the network has made it clear that it will not tolerate racist behavior, and the cancellation of the show is a testament to that commitment.

The news has sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry, with many celebrities and industry leaders speaking out against Barr's tweet. ""Roseanne's tweet is a reminder that words have power, and that racism has no place in our society,"" said actress and activist, Viola Davis. ""I applaud ABC for taking a stand against hate speech.""

The cancellation of Roseanne is a significant moment in the ongoing debate about racism and free speech in America. It is a reminder that words have consequences, and that the entertainment industry has a responsibility to promote inclusivity and respect for all people."

Jokingly promoting their new boy band, dubbed “James Street,” group members Nick Carter, Howie Dorough, AJ McLean, Kevin Richardson and Brian Littrell performed an mock version of their 1999 single, “Larger Than Life,” changing it to “Late Late-r Than Life” to reflect Corden’s 12:37 p.m. broadcast.

In the performance, the late-night host and singers donned their signature white attire, recognizable from their 1999 album, Millennium, which featured the “Larger Than Life” single.  The sketch opened with Corden explaining that he plans to take over for one of the Backstreet Boys at their performance later that night. ""Corden's back, alright,"" he sang to the bandmembers as he stated his plan.

gossipcop-860217,0,"A CONTROVERSIAL reality TV star has courted controversy after admitting that she used drugs while pregnant with her daughter less than a year after admitting she nearly died of a heroin overdose.  Jenelle Evans’ past has been notoriously sketchy but the MTV Teen Mom 2 star says that despite the fact she has gotten her life back on track and that she’s “not a bad kid any more”, online speculation over her parenting methods is forcing Child Protection Services on her.  It comes after fans accused the star of child abuse after her son, Kaiser, begged for food on the TV show. The shocking footage sparked a Twitter backlash with the hashtag #SaveKaiser and cost the mother-of-three her job as an ambassador with Blue Apron.  In her memoir, Read Between the Lines: From the Diary of a Teenage Mom, Ms Evans admitted that at the peak of her drug addiction she was using heroin “four or five times a day”.  “I was hooked,” she said of her abusive relationship, which saw her arrested for possession of marijuana and heroin, according to Radar.  This week, Ms Evans appeared on The Brand podcast and admitted that while she was pregnant with daughter Ensley, she tested positive for THC, the principal psychoactive found in cannabis.  “I’m not going to lie about that. I tested positive for THC,” the reality star, 26, said.  Daughter Ensley did not test positive.  Ms Evans said the chemical compound was found shortly after she had given birth to her daughter just over one year ago after Child Protective Services asked her if she had smoked during her pregnancy.  “I said, ‘I did within the past 30 days,’” she explained.  “I said, ‘I have really bad esophageal spasms and I throw up every five minutes. I can’t eat.’ And they said, ‘OK, some mums do that. We are not here to judge. We are writing down your information.’”  She said that when Child Protective Services arrived for the wellness check, they closed the case soon after.  But then Ms Evans blamed online speculation over her parenting for at least 30 more visits from Child Protection, calling out “haters online saying that I abuse my kids”.  Despite promising she’s not using, viewers on the hit reality show, on which Ms Evans has appeared since 2011, aren’t so sure.

Or I’d be losing a lot of weight,” Ms Evans said.  But the young mum, who already has two children, sons Jace, 8, and Kaiser, 3 has a sketchy history with drug abuse, including a near-fatal heroin overdose in 2012.  “I was afraid to speak out and tell people that I was on drugs,” she told Us Weekly last year,  “I basically blacked out and woke up not remembering anything.  “I really was so close to dying.”  After her overdose Ms Evans described how she withdrew from the drug, describing it as “worst flu I’ve ever had for seven days”.  But by that stage the drug had already taken its toll; she had lost custody of son Jace and was “disowned” by family and friends.  “It hurt my heart, made me sick to my soul that I couldn’t see my son. I filled that hateful void with more drugs,” she wrote in her memoir.  “The drugs always made the pain go away. They didn’t turn on me or betray me.

They do not deserve to be witnessing what’s more than likely going on in their home.. #SaveKaiser #TeenMom2 #TeenMomOG #JenelleEvans #DavidEason — leeeasha (@leashaboo89) February 21, 2018  “First of all, if I were on drugs I wouldn’t be able to sit here in the morning and get the kids ready and eat healthily. Or I’d be losing a lot of weight,” Ms Evans said.  But the young mum, who already has two children, sons Jace, 8, and Kaiser, 3 has a sketchy history with drug abuse, including a near-fatal heroin overdose in 2012.  “I was afraid to speak out and tell people that I was on drugs,” she told Us Weekly last year,  “I basically blacked out and woke up not remembering anything.  “I really was so close to dying.”  After her overdose Ms Evans described how she withdrew from the drug, describing it as “worst flu I’ve ever had for seven days”.  But by that stage the drug had already taken its toll; she had lost custody of son Jace and was “disowned” by family and friends.  “It hurt my heart, made me sick to my soul that I couldn’t see my son. I filled that hateful void with more drugs,” she wrote in her memoir.  “The drugs always made the pain go away. They didn’t turn on me or betray me. I guess heroin was my first steady, dependable lover. It gave me what I needed to live and I gave it my life. By this entry, heroin was the only thing I had in my life that loved me.”  According to Kidspot, a report published in the Journal of the American Medical Association claimed that the rate of pregnant women using marijuana has increased 62 per cent  Marijuana is the “most widely used illicit drug among all pregnant women”, the "

(Photo: Todd Owyoung, for iHeartRadio)  A younger-than-normal audience packed The View's studio on Wednesday morning in order to see their pop idol Taylor Swift, live and in person. Swift's new album 1989 has already shot to the top on iTunes and has received favorable reviews from critics but her label, Big Machine Records, might not have been so confident that this offering from Swift would be a success.  ""I wasn't necessarily nervous about this album,"" Swift said. ""I think my label might have been a little nervous but they'll never say it now.""  Swift, whose roots were initially planted in country music, is now going full-steam ahead into Top 40 fare with 1989.  ""I knew I wanted to change the way I did things creatively,"" Swift told the View co-hosts. ""I knew I wanted to keep people on their toes. I didn't want anyone to have their feelings hurt by me changing directions creatively, because that's never the intention.""  With lyrics about empowerment and ridding one's self of negativity, Swift is once again being lauded as a feminist for a younger generation.  ""It's interesting how feminism has come up in conversation so much more in the last year,"" Swift said. ""I was never really taught the definition of feminism when I was a little girl and I wish I had been.""  Whether her constant astonishment at her own overwhelming success is genuine or just false modesty is still undeterminable. Confident as she may be, Swift admits that she still fears failure.  ""How do you not know how awesome you are?"" Nicolle Wallace asked.  ""I keep a nice healthy level of insecurity going at all times,"" said Swift.

The streaming giant has handed out a 10-episode, straight-to-series order for vampire drama V-Wars, based on the IDW novel of the same name, with the Vampire Diaries alum set to star. The order comes as another IDW property, the beloved Locke and Key, is awaiting word on a new home after Hulu's surprising pass on the pilot.  V-Wars revolves around Dr. Luther Swann (Somerhalder), who enters a world of horror when a mysterious disease transforms his best friend, Michael Fayne, into a murderous predator who feeds on other humans. As the disease spreads and more people are transformed, society fractures into opposing camps pitting normal people against the growing number of these vampires. Swann races against time to understand what’s happening, while Fayne rises to become the powerful underground leader of the vampires.  The series is based on IDW Publishing's V-Wars franchise, written by New York Times best-selling author Jonathan Maberry. High Park Entertainment produces alongside IDW Entertainment, which will distribute the series worldwide (excluding Canada). 1-800-Missing creators William Laurin and Glenn Davis will serve as showrunners.

V-Wars was first announced in 2014 as part of a straight-to-series deal with Entertainment One.

Despite multiple attempts to bring the series to both the big and small screen, IDW remains committed to finding the project a creative home.

Background: Washington Post: How Mike Flynn Was Undone By A Phone Call    ""We’re going after this aggressively,"" Sessions said about the leak of the transcript of Flynn's call. ""I am directing it personally... and we’re pursuing it aggressively.""            Sessions also said that there are currently 27 open investigations regarding leaks of classified information. ""In the last two years before I became Attorney General there were each year there were three open investigations of classified leaks now we have 27,"" he noted.      MARIA BARTIROMO: There are felonies apparently that have already taken place. I mean we had on this program just last week, the chairman of the Intel committee Devin Nunez and he said there are felonies that are going, not looked at all they’re going by over and over listen to what he told me just last Sunday.    REP. DEVIN NUNES: The big felony in all of this that nobody talks about from the very beginning was the leak of highly classified information when they leaked the phone call of the Russian ambassador talking to General Mike Flynn right before the inauguration. That was a felony, nothing’s ever been done about it.    BARTIROMO: Is your office investigating this sir?    SESSIONS: That is a violation of the law, to leak classified documents and it is being investigated. I will say this, the last two years before I became Attorney General there were each year there were three open investigations of classified leaks now we have 27 we’re going after this aggressively. I am directing it personally, some of the matters involve this matter and some of it is a matter I am not recused on and we’re pursuing it aggressively.","You are a journalist.

Mike Flynn and the Russian Ambassador.","Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Sunday vowed to aggressively investigate the leak of a phone call between former national security advisor General Mike Flynn and the Russian ambassador, asserting that the disclosure of classified information is a ""criminal act.""

In an interview with FOX News Channel's Sunday Morning Futures, hosted by Maria Bartiromo, Sessions stated, ""We are aggressively investigating the leak of this transcript to the public, and we will continue to do so until we reach the bottom of this. It is a criminal act to disclose classified information, and we will not tolerate it.""

Sessions' comments come as the Department of Justice (DOJ) is facing intense scrutiny over the handling of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The Attorney General has faced criticism from both Republicans and Democrats over his recusal from the probe, as well as his alleged involvement in the firing of former FBI Director James Comey.

However, Sessions maintained that the DOJ is ""doing its job"" in investigating the Flynn-Russian ambassador call leak, and emphasized that the department will ""follow the facts wherever they may lead.""

""We will not let political considerations or personal biases interfere with our duty to uphold the law and protect the American people,"" Sessions said. ""We will continue to work tirelessly to uncover the truth and ensure that those responsible for the leak are held accountable.""

The investigation into the Flynn-Russian ambassador call leak is just one of several probes currently being conducted by the DOJ into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The department is also investigating potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, as well as allegations of obstruction of justice by the President.

Sessions' comments on Sunday suggest that the DOJ is taking the leak of the Flynn-Russian ambassador call very seriously, and is committed to pursuing those responsible for the disclosure of classified information. The Attorney General's vow to ""aggressively"" investigate the leak is likely to be seen as a response to criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike, who have called for the DOJ to take a more aggressive stance in addressing the issue."

According to Deadline, the Bridesmaids star is being considered to play Cheetah, a classic comic-book villain, in the upcoming highly anticipated movie sequel. Wiig, who is mostly known for her comedy chops, would be the adversary to Gal Gadot’s Diana Prince. This time the superhero has skipped ahead in time from World War II to fight crime in the 1980s. Cheetah, who was originally depicted as the alter ego of a socialite, will probably fit right in with Reagan’s America. Though, then again, since this is the Cold War she could suddenly become a Soviet. Patty Jenkins is also returning as the film’s director.","You are a journalist.

The movie is expected to explore the character's global popularity and her mission as a hero. 

Wiig is best known for her roles in Bridesmaids and Ghostbusters, and has recently appeared in Downsizing. She has also received critical acclaim for her performances in The Martian and Mother!.

Cheetah is one of Wonder Woman's most iconic foes, and has been featured in various comic book series and animated TV shows. She has the ability to transform into a cheetah-like creature and possesses enhanced speed and agility.

If Wiig is cast as Cheetah, it would mark her first major villainous role in a blockbuster movie. She is expected to bring her signature comedic timing and depth to the role, which could make the character a more complex and compelling villain.

The casting of Wiig as Cheetah would be a significant addition to the Wonder Woman franchise, and could potentially set up a thrilling showdown between the two characters in the sequel.

The actor appears on the September cover of GQ where he explained why he chooses to stay very quiet when it comes to his private life.  “I always think the risk reward is very much weighted in the wrong direction,” Pattinson, 31, said of opening up in interviews. “If I could stay silent, I would.”  Pattinson has been dating singer F.K.A. Twigs since 2014, and recently told Howard Stern they were “kind of” engaged. But when asked by GQ if he was getting married, the actor — who revealed he calls his girlfriend Twigs — responded with a noncommittal “eh.”  Daniel Jackson/GQ  Pattinson said that he went to therapy a few years ago – and his therapist commented that he was good at “talking without saying anything.” He said he uses that skill in all his interviews. The Good Time actor explained that he chooses to stay private so people don’t form ideas about his personality that may later change and label him as dishonest.  RELATED: Celeb Quotes of the Day: Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone & More  “I want to be misunderstood,” he told the magazine after declining to talk about anything personal. “People are always changing, and the more you put something down in print, people form opinions and they’re constantly creating who they think you are.

He recalled how he would have different cars parked around Los Angeles with a full change of clothes. If he noticed he was being followed by paparazzi, he would pop into the garages, change, and leave in a different car.  He would also try to confuse photographers by having all of his friends order different rides out of restaurants when they were together and sending the cars to different places after trading outfits with one of his friends. Pattinson also recalled riding in trunks several times to hide from the photographers – and once drove around all night when one was tailing him to find out where his new house is.  “There are ways to disappear, like, fairly easily,” he said. “It just involves effort, and most people can’t be bothered to put the effort in.”  Good Time hits theaters August 11.","You are a journalist.

After years of overexposure thanks to his star-making turn in Twilight, Robert Pattinson values his privacy.

Here is your piece of news:

In a rare interview with GQ, actor Robert Pattinson has opened up about his desire for privacy in the wake of his meteoric rise to fame following the Twilight franchise. The 35-year-old star, who has been in the public eye for over a decade, revealed that he has become increasingly protective of his personal life, citing the intense media scrutiny he faced during his early years of fame as the reason for his desire for seclusion.

""I just wanted to be able to walk down the street and not be recognized,"" Pattinson told GQ in the September issue, which features the actor on the cover. ""I think there's a certain level of privacy that I've been denied for the past 10 years, and I'm trying to reclaim that.""

Pattinson's turn as the brooding vampire Edward Cullen in Twilight catapulted him to international fame, but the constant media attention took a toll on his personal life. He has been the subject of numerous tabloid headlines and paparazzi stalking, leading him to become increasingly reclusive and protective of his private life.

Despite his desire for privacy, Pattinson has continued to excel in his career, starring in critically acclaimed films such as Water for Elephants and Good Time. His upcoming projects include the highly anticipated The King's Man and Christopher Nolan's Tenet.

Pattinson's interview with GQ is a rare glimpse into his private life and offers insight into the challenges of fame in the digital age. The actor's determination to reclaim his privacy is a testament to his resilience and dedication to his craft. As he continues to thrive in the spotlight, it is clear that Pattinson will not let the constant glare of fame dim his passion for acting."

gossipcop-905056,0,"Dunham's presence in a photo celebrating the initiative raised eyebrows.  UPDATE (1/9/18): Tessa Thompson has clarified her statements regarded Time’s Up and Lena Dunham in a Twitter post.  EARLIER: Tessa Thompson is among the many women taking part in the Time’s Up initiative, which made its presence felt at last night’s Golden Globes ceremony. In an Instagram comment, the star of “Thor: Ragnarok” said planning for the red carpet the day before the event required “6 hours, 60 artists, 8 activists and a lot of coffee.” And one of those people, Thompson said, was not Lena Dunham.  In the celebratory photo Thompson posted yesterday are Michelle Williams, Billie Jean King, Rashida Jones, Susan Sarandon, Laura Dern — and, on the end of the middle row, far right, is Dunham. The “Girls” creator and star has lain low of late; the last Tweet she wrote was an apology for casting doubt on Aurora Perrineau’s rape accusation. And, according to Thompson, her participation in Time’s Up planning was limited to the photo op: “Lena was not anywhere present in our group during the countless hours of work for the last two months.”  Thompson’s statement, which came in response to several commenters questioning why Dunham was in the picture at all, reads in full:  “Lena was not anywhere present in our group during the countless hours of work for the last two months. We hosted an open house for actresses for red carpet messaging and Lena presence was a surprise to us all. This is a time of reckoning. And for many, a re-education. So many women also have real work to do. I’m afraid it’s too nuanced a conversation to have on this platform. But I hear you, and know that your thoughts and words are not lost on me. It’s been discussed”  What’s next for the initiative remains to be seen, but it shows no signs of slowing down. Most attendees wore black last night in recognition of the sexual-harassment problem in Hollywood and beyond, and Time’s Up was brought up several times throughout the ceremony.  When asked to comment by IndieWire, Dunham responded, “I was honored to be invited to the meeting by a close friend and to observe the work that these amazing women have been doing the past few months. For highly personal reasons, I’ve been unable to join previous efforts but being asked to be a part of this celebratory moment was truly beautiful. I’ve worked with Tessa and respect her artistry and admire her consistent candor.”  Additional reporting by Jenna Marotta.","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news.

Caitlyn touched down in London town last week to promote her to promote her juicy new autobiography The Secrets Of My Life (she even popped by the This Morning studios) and many are speculating whether she had a secret meeting with Celebrity Big Brother bosses.  Sources have told the Daily Star: ""The bookers are really keen to have Caitlyn in the house.  ""They know she’d be TV gold so they’re prepared to break the bank for her. The world has been fascinated by Caitlyn’s story and getting her would push ratings through the roof.""  Well, they're not wrong there.  Caitlyn is no stranger to reality telly – she's starred in Keeping Up With The Kardashians since forevs, and even had her own show I Am Cait – and after proof that the Kardashian/Jenner family feud is still rife, this could be the perfect opportunity for her to set the record straight.  She even recently revealed that she hasn't spoken to Kim Kardashian in a 'very long time'.  ""I love Kimberly, I think she's a wonderful person,"" Caitlyn said on Australia's Today show.  ""But, well, to be honest with you, I really haven't talked to her in a long time. I've kind of let everything calm down. So I kind of stay, you know, I keep my distance. I'm out there trying to make a difference in the world. There's a lot of drama in the Kardashian family.""  And staying loyal to her momager, Kim didn't hold back during a recent interview with Ellen DeGeneres and even implied that Caitlyn was lying about the things she had said about Kris in her memoir.  ""My heart breaks for my mom, you know, because I feel like she’s been through so much and Caitlyn is promoting this book and she’s saying all these things.

gossipcop-7658353025,1,"“A Star Is Born” is that thing we always yearn for but so rarely get to see: a transcendent Hollywood movie. It’s the fourth remake of a story that dates back to 1932, but this one has a look and vibe all its own — rapturous and swooning, but also delicate and intimate and luminous. It’s set in the present day, but in spirit it’s a sophisticated retro ’70s drama built around the uncanny flow of feeling that develops between the movie’s two stars: Bradley Cooper, who plays Jackson Maine, a hard-drinking, bad-ol’-boy redneck rock ‘n’ roller who is still hanging on as a popular attraction but has lost the lust for what he’s doing, and Lady Gaga, in her fetching and accomplished movie-star debut, as Ally, an ingenuous, fresh-faced singer-songwriter who becomes his lover and stage partner before rocketing on her own into the new pop stratosphere. She takes off as he slowly crashes — that’s the soapy tragic “Star Is Born” concept. But what the movie does is to take this fabled melodramatic romantic seesaw and turn it into something indelibly heartfelt and revealing. Cooper directed the movie himself, working from a script he co-wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, and to say that he does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment. As a filmmaker, Bradley Cooper gets right onto the high wire, staging scenes that take their time and play out with a shaggy intimacy that’s shorn of the usual “beats.” The new “Star Is Born” is a total emotional knockout, but it’s also a movie that gets you to believe, at every step, in the complicated rapture of the story it’s telling. More Reviews Venice Film review: 'Isis, Tomorrow. The Lost Souls of Mosul' Telluride Film Review: 'They'll Love Me When I'm Dead' The 1976 version, starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, had some terrific cornball love songs, but they didn’t belong anywhere near the stadium-rock stage, and neither did Streisand, which is part of why the movie came off as borderline ludicrous. It seemed stranded, with a kind of campy sincere ineptitude, between three worlds: Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand rock-princess fantasy. But from the electrifying opening moments of the new version, in which Jackson, boozy and raw, with his sunburned squint and hard-bitten shit-kicker sexiness, takes the stage of a gigantic stadium and launches into a grinding slow rocker that sounds like “Victim of Love”-era Eagles as done by the Allman Brothers, the movie is thrillingly authentic. That’s no minor accomplishment. Hollywood almost never succeeds in nailing the rock world, but “A Star Is Born,” though a love story through and through, is the most lived-in rock ‘n’ roll movie since “Almost Famous.” And that absolute looks right, sounds right, feels right verisimilitude sets the stage for everything that follows. Jackson, who looks to be in his mid-40s, has been around long enough that he now occupies a grey zone between legend and nostalgia. He can still fill an arena full of screaming fans, and his old hits have become classic-rock chestnuts, but his sound and persona have long slipped out of the zeitgeist. His whole outlaw look — the beard and rancher’s hat, the Kristofferson-meets-Skynyrd soused macho twinkle — mark him as a charismatic relic, and the grand irony is this: What that look, and sound, are all about is an era when rock ‘n’ roll strutted its “authenticity,” but now that he’s out of date, Jackson’s authenticity looks more than ever like a showbiz conceit, frozen in amber. It’s a part he’s playing, an image he’s working — and secretly struggling — to keep alive. He’s got a signature ballad that goes “Maybe it’s time to let the old ways die,” and when he wrote it (long ago), he probably didn’t know that he was talking about himself. In the first of many telling jump cuts, the film leaps from his on-stage glory to Jackson slinking into the back of his car, weary and alone, grabbing the bottle of gin he’s got stashed there. He takes a guzzle, and Cooper, acting with his body, lets you feel just how much Jackson (between sickly coughs) needs the lifeblood of that drink. It’s what he believes in more than the show he’s just finished. How do you play a drunk? We know, of course, that the answer is not to “play drunk,” but Cooper doesn’t just avoid the usual slurry shambling (though at key moments he does a little of that too, and it’s powerful). He brings off something I’ve rarely seen done this exquisitely: He plays blitzed, very functional and in his element, his smile and reflexes greased by the liquor. Jackson speaks in a deep, low, deliberate Southern-stud growl — a voice with real music in it, though one that lets you taste all the booze it’s marinated in. Needing another drink, he has his driver drop him off at the first available bar, which turns out to be a roadside dive on drag-queen karaoke night. It’s not his scene, but he doesn’t mind. He’s the same celebrity everywhere he goes, so he’s in the perfect mood of lit-up contentment when she walks on stage. She is Ally, the one non-drag performer of the night (she’s friends with all the queens there, so they let her sing for real). When she enters the room, the movie pulls off a neat trick. We’ve already seen Ally break up with her boyfriend over the phone, letting out a banshee wail in the process, and when she appears in heavy white-make up and pasted on half-circle eyebrows, her hair teased into a punked-out French pastry, then does a strutting-down-the-bar version of “La Vie en Rose” that she milks for every flourish of theatrical kitsch she can, we think, “Of course! How Gaga-netic!” Backstage after the show, Jackson gently pulls off one of Ally’s eyebrows and asks her out for a drink. But when she emerges from the dressing room","You are a journalist.

The 'sentence' is: ",“A Star Is Born” is that thing we always yearn for but so rarely get to see: a transcendent Hollywood movie.,"A Star Is Born: A Transcendent Hollywood Movie

Hollywood, CA - In a season filled with blockbuster franchises and sequels, ""A Star Is Born"" stands out as a beacon of hope for those yearning for a more authentic and emotionally resonant cinematic experience. This transcendent film, starring Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, is a rare gem that delivers on its promise of a powerful and uplifting story.

From the opening frames, it is clear that ""A Star Is Born"" is something special. The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the beauty of the American West in a way that is both intimate and grandiose. The performances from the leads are nothing short of phenomenal, with Lady Gaga delivering a career-defining turn as Ally, a talented but struggling singer who finds fame and love with Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper), a seasoned musician with a troubled past.

The chemistry between the leads is palpable, and their performances are elevated by the film's original music, which is catchy and memorable. The story, which follows the rise of Ally from a small club performer to a global superstar, is both inspiring and heartbreaking, and the film's themes of love, loss, and redemption are timeless and universal.

What sets ""A Star Is Born"" apart from other Hollywood movies is its authenticity and vulnerability. The film is not afraid to tackle difficult subjects, such as addiction and mental health, and does so with sensitivity and empathy. The result is a movie that is both entertaining and emotionally resonant, a true masterpiece that will leave audiences moved and inspired.

In a year filled with so many mediocre and forgettable movies, ""A Star Is Born"" stands out as a shining example of what Hollywood can do when it takes risks and tells authentic stories. This is a movie that will be remembered for years to come, and is a must-see for anyone who loves cinema."

With HBO exploring five different GoT spinoff concepts, “we’d be lucky to get one that we’re very, very excited about, and we did get that. We’re just starting the search for a director… we have to cast it. We hope to be shooting sometime in the new year.”  HBO ordered a pilot for the untitled prequel last month, with the action set thousands of years before the events of Game of Thrones. Per the official logline, “the series chronicles the world’s descent from the golden Age of Heroes into its darkest hour. And only one thing is for sure: from the horrifying secrets of Westeros’ history to the true origin of the white walkers, the mysteries of the East to the Starks of legend… it’s not the story we think we know.”  In addition to writing the pilot, Goldman (X-Men: First Class) will serve as showrunner, and will join Game of Thrones author George R.R. Martin as an executive producer. You’ll have to wait a bit to see it, though: Bloys said earlier this year the prequel won’t debut until at least a year after the original GoT wraps up its final season — which won’t start until the first half of 2019.","You are a journalist.

Years later, Brad regrets leaving the Friends star for his now-ex Angelina Jolie, a source told In Touch exclusively.  Following his 2016 separation from Angie, Brad sobered up and sought therapy. And now, he’s “in touch with emotions and his true self like never before,” the source says.  Brad Pitt finally opens up about his bitter divorce with Angelina Jolie  And it seems like this self-awareness comes with some great realisations. “He has come to realise that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,” the source adds. “And while he’s not in love with Jen, he realises how much he does love her. Brad keeps telling friends that he’s seeing everything more clearly.”  However, these realisations are obviously far too late. Jennifer has been married to Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for two years now.  And while Brad would “never dream of” ruining his ex’s new marriage, he “would take a second chance at love with Jen in a heartbeat.”  If they can’t be romantic partners, though, the War Machine star wants Jen to be his partner in other pursuits, In Touch further reported.  Brad Pitt “much happier” following split from Angelina Jolie  “They worked well together” when they formed the production company Plan B in 2001, an insider close to Brad told In Touch. “He wants Jen involved again as he produces and develops more and more high-quality film and cable TV products.”  That kind of professional partnership could pay off for Jen, too, since the insider states she wants in on “prestige projects” under his production banner. “She’d be beyond thrilled to win an Academy Award for Best Actress — something that’s evaded both her and Angelina.”  “He still considers Jen the love of his life,” the source concluded.

It is hard to imagine a My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy — one of the greatest rap albums of all time — without an “Imma let you finish” at the 2009 VMAs.  His new album, ye, doesn’t merit any similar mercy.  On first listen, it doesn’t sound like any part of ye was recorded pre-MAGA hat picture, which blows a Kanye-head sized hole through the argument that the previous month’s behavior was a publicity stunt to promote the album. If anything, the album seems like an meek afterthought to the Twitter tirade and dive into right-wing politics. Most of it deals with the repercussions of the storm which came before it, and for the first time in his career, the artist’s personality is overwhelming the art.  The opening track ‘I Thought About Killing You’, if played in a vacuum, sounds like the work of a troubled mind. If a poem like this came from a loved one, it would surely merit discussion about a trip to the therapist. Kanye goes on to deliver cringe-worthy rhymes on issues ranging from Russell Simmons rape allegations to his petrification on realizing that his daughter might one day look like his wife. He teases a few tidbits of The Old Kanye, chopping up beats from Slick Rick and The Edwin Hawkins Singers samples on ‘No Mistakes’, to keep his fans just interested enough. It’s telling that the one standout track, ‘Ghost Town’ is the track on which Kanye lurks in the background, devoting more time on production than on spoken word, and letting John Legend and Kid Cudi take over.  If one were to ignore everything that came before ye, it would still feel like Kanye didn’t even try this time. The usual meticulousness and perfectionism has apparently been supplanted by a Kanye shrug. The music is haphazard and hollow, mirroring the guy making it. Maybe he’s become blasé and doesn’t want to spend time on music anymore. He did say he wanted to run for President in 2020 (or 2024?) anyway.","You are a journalist.

Title: Kanye West's Reckless Behavior Turns Costly

In the past, Kanye West's capriciousness has been repeatedly forgiven and, at times, belatedly rewarded with accolades. However, his self-indulgent stunts have become a liability, threatening to derail his once-illustrious career. The recent controversy surrounding West's interruption of Taylor Swift's VMA acceptance speech has left many questioning whether the rapper has finally gone too far.

West's history of outlandish antics, from his infamous ""Imma let you finish"" moment at the 2009 VMAs to his more recent rants on Twitter, has long been met with a mix of amusement and forgiveness. But as his behavior becomes increasingly erratic and disruptive, it is no longer possible to ignore the negative impact it is having on his career.

The fallout from the VMA incident has been swift and severe. West has been widely criticized by the music industry and the public at large, with many calling for him to be banned from future awards shows. His endorsement deals are reportedly in jeopardy, and his once-thriving music sales have taken a hit.

Insiders close to West say that he is struggling to come to terms with the backlash, and that his recent Twitter rants are a sign of his increasing desperation. ""Kanye has always been a bit of a wild card, but this is getting out of hand,"" one source said. ""He needs to take a step back and reassess his priorities before it's too late.""

As the dust settles on the VMA controversy, it is clear that Kanye West's reckless behavior has turned costly. The question now is whether he can recover from this latest debacle and continue to produce the innovative, boundary-pushing music that has made him a household name. Only time will tell."

Kim had been asked – again – to discuss his decision to exit the CBS procedural, a topic that has been covered long and often since it happened.  “I’ve known [CBS Entertainment President] Kelly [Kahl] and [CBS SEVP Programming] Thom [Sherman] for a while…I know them, and like them, and am grateful to them for the words they said on their panel the other day.”  “That said, it’s possible to be grateful and respectful, and still maintain a steadfast sense of your self worth,” Kim said, pointedly.

Kim said he brought the format to the U.S., calling it “crucial” to have signed House’s David Shore as EP.  “I am really content being behind the scenes” on the new ABC drama, Kim says, calling it “fascinating” to watch the actors, as a producer.  “At some point I would love to play with them…David and I have talked about it in the past and we’ll see what comes up.’","You are a journalist.

The glitzy affair, hosted by Late Night's Seth Meyers, is one of the biggest nights in Hollywood.

The Golden Globe outcomes occasionally raise eyebrows, but the awards show is a good indicator of who might take home Oscars statuettes.  Golden Globe Nominees 2018: The Full List  The Golden Globes will take on a decidedly darker tone this year, arriving in the wake of allegations of sexual harassment and assault against Harvey Weinstein and other powerful figures in the film and television industry.

gossipcop-864734,0,"• American walks out of after media questions about Florida crash • Five-times champion beats Elise Mertens 7-6, 6-4 in first round  A tearful Venus Williams walked out of her press conference on Monday after her first-round victory at Wimbledon, the American’s first match since her involvement in a fatal car accident in Florida that police allege she caused.  The No10 seed deflected a series of queries about the wrongful-death lawsuit filed on Thursday before she became overcome with emotion, prompting the moderator to request that journalists refrained from asking about the incident.  Venus Williams ‘at fault’ in fatal car crash, say Florida police Read more  “There are really no words to describe, like, how devastating and – yeah. I’m completely speechless. It’s just – yeah, I mean, I’m just …” a visibly shaken Williams said, her voice trailing off.  The seven-times major champion then broke down in tears, stepping out into the hallway to gather herself with members of her team.  Williams returned after about five minutes to field five more questions, mostly related to her 7-6 (7), 6-4 win against Belgium’s Elise Mertens amid wildly fluctuating weather on No1 Court, as the sun‑splashed afternoon gave way to blustery conditions and ultimately rain.  The American – at 37 the oldest woman in the draw here – was at her imperious best in the opening stages, breaking Mertens in her opening service game and dictating points with her serve. But Mertens, who was not born when Williams turned professional and only four when she won the first of her five Wimbledon singles titles, overcame those initial nerves and began challenging Williams with powerful groundstrokes into the corners and well-concealed variety.  Mertens blinked during the first-set tiebreak, then surrendered her early service break in the second. Rain interrupted play with the 21-year-old, who had just saved her second match point with a gorgeous backhand lob, serving at 3-5, 40-40 in the second set.  After a 33-minute delay Williams finished the job, uncorking an overhead smash to see off Mertens after an hour and 40 minutes and booking a second-round match against China’s Qiang Wang.  The American flashed her familiar smile after meeting her opponent at the net but it became clear during the press conference that her 20th appearance at the tournament she has won five times will be loaded with emotion.  “You can’t prepare for everything,” Williams said. “I have no idea what tomorrow will bring. That’s all I can say about it. That’s what I’ve learned.”  Palm Beach Gardens police said witnesses told investigators that Williams ran a red light in her Toyota Sequoia SUV at around 1pm on 9 June, injuring 79-year-old Jerome Barson, who died 13 days later. Barson was riding in the passenger seat when the Hyundai Accent driven by his wife, Linda, crashed into the side of Williams’s vehicle.  Williams told investigators she entered the six-lane intersection on a green light but was forced to stop midway through because of traffic ahead of her, failing to see the Barsons’ car when she continued through at about 5mph.  But police concluded the driver of Williams’s car “is at fault for violating the right of way”. Linda Barson, 68, also sustained injuries, including “a cracked sternum, shattered right arm, broken wrist, hand and fingers”.  Williams made her first public comments on the incident in a Facebook post on Friday night, describing herself as “heartbroken”.  One of only two former Wimbledon champions in the women’s field, Williams has a promising draw and perhaps a renewed ambition after her inspired run to the Australian Open final in January – a remarkable feat given the incurable autoimmune disease that has hamstrung her game for most of the decade.","You are a journalist.

gossipcop-895055,0,"Viewers of the 2017 American Music Awards witnessed history.  Introduced by The Chainsmokers, BTS made their U.S. television debut at the 2017 American Music Awards on Sunday, November 19th. BTS is taking the U.S over a landslide by being the first Korean Pop Boy Band to perform on a major American awards show.  BTS delivered their latest hit “DNA” with flashy choreography and enormous support from their A.R.M.Y. (a name given to their international fanbase) who accompanied them with chants throughout their performance. Tweets during and after their epic performance took over social media with the hashtag #BTSxAMAs. Fans, attendees and those new to the K-pop boy band fanbase obsessed over their amazing dance moves, voice control, red carpet fashion and physical aspect of the members of the boy band.

gossipcop-1716370499,1,"Dakota Johnson; most of us know her as the actress from Fifty Shades of Grey. While we may have seen Johnson in some pretty intimate positions on-screen, there’s definitely a lot we don’t know about the Fifty Shades star. Like, for instance, the superfluity of familiar names in her family tree. Seeing that her popular movie, Fifty Shades Darker came out on the day of love—Valentine's Day—it's only fitting to dedicate a piece to the actress who brought us the sexy and quaint, Anastasia Steele. Johnson, after all, has become somewhat something of a Valentine’s Day staple, herself. Here are 15 facts about Dakota Johnson or, as some might call her, ""that girl from Fifty Shades of Grey."" We guarantee that she will no longer by ""that girl"" by the end of the list! 15 Her Family Tree Is Full Of Famous Faces You know how we said there are a few familiar names in her family tree? Well, we weren’t lying. Her parents are fellow actors, Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. Unfortunately, her parents divorced in 1994 so Dakota had to split her time between the two. ""It was the only way that I could be with them,"" she said in an interview for Cosmopolitan. ""And since they were divorced, I would spend two weeks with one and two weeks with the other, traveling with a tutor."" But wait, it gets better. Her maternal grandmother (can you guess..) is Hitchcock actress Tippi Hedren. Yes, that’s right, so clearly creative talent lies in that family. We’ve never heard of a family tree with so many famous names! Thanksgiving is probably a whirlwind. Now, Dakota Johnson is another famous name in that tree. 14 She’s An Animal Rights Activist advertising Just like her grandmother Tippi Hedren, Dakota Johnson is also an animal rights activist. Like grandmother, like granddaughter shall we say? As animal lovers ourselves, we’re pleased to hear that she’s following in her grandmother’s footsteps—both in acting and in animal rights. In 2014, Johnson saved 12 horses from being slaughtered by paying for them. What a sweet thing to do! We bet her grandmother was really proud. It’s always so great to hear about celebrities doing positive things - so naturally, we’re happy to hear of Dakota’s compassionate side. We admit we have a soft spot for animal lovers, but who doesn't? We always love hearing about people doing good deeds for animals and it’s always nice to hear celebrities using their celebrity title for the better. 13 She Grew Up Shooting Guns And Riding Horses In Colorado She may play the innocent and naive Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades movies, but growing up Johnson was anything but naive. She grew up in Colorado at her dad’s house, where she learned to build a fire, ride a horse, ride motorbikes, and even shoot a gun. And this was all before she was just 10 years old! Sounds like a badass kid to us! But when she wasn’t at her father’s house, she was at her mom’s house in L.A. which she also loved. It's hard to imagine a 10 year old these days shooting guns, riding motorbikes, or building fires without being grounded. But it sounds like she had a pretty inspiring and freeing childhood which makes us fall for the actress all the more. 12 She Never Dates advertising By the header, we mean she never has casual relationships. She only has long-term relationships. Good for her, is all we can say! You hear of so many celebrities who are constantly dating other celebrities. You can barely keep up with who they’re dating these days. It seems to be one guy or girl after another. So it’s great to hear of Dakota’s conservative views on relationships. Apparently she’s only ever been in long-term, serious relationships; she doesn’t just date. That probably explains why she’s been in a relationship with model Matthew Hitt since 2014. Yes, it’s been a kind of an on-and-off relationship but they’ve been in it for the long haul so far. So, to sum up, we like her whole dating attitude. The commitment is great and saves you a lot of time. 11 She HATED School It seems like we have something in common with Dakota Johnson: a loathing of school. Okay, so maybe not all of you hated school - many of you probably loved school or at least thrived at school. But most of us can say with the utmost certainty that we hated school with a passion. We all have our reasons why. Johnson, for instance, hated school because she felt like an ""alien."" She said she didn’t understand the process of school as a child and felt ""suffocated."" I don't know about you guys, but I can totally relate with Dakota on this. Many of us felt like we didn’t really fit in at school so it’s especially comforting to hear that a big name like Dakota Johnson also felt like a social outcast in class. Like many of us, she preferred hanging out with her friends than going to school. But hey, we admire her honesty. 10 Auditioning Gives Her Panic Attacks advertising Watching the pristine-looking A-list celebrities gliding around the Golden Globes Award ceremony is enough to wreck your mind with self-doubt over their unbelievably high levels of confidence and self esteem. If only we could possess as much poise! The truth is, many of these celebrities don’t feel that way at all; confident and self assured, that is. Dakota Johnson, for example, gets so nervous during auditions that she often has panic attacks. And we’re not just talking a bit of breathlessness here and there, we’re talking full-on panic attacks—the real deal. So before you come to your conclusions that the celebrities you see on television and in magazines are way more confident than you’ll ever be, just remember something: every single one of them suffers from self-doubt at one point or another.

Please write a piece of news based on that sentence.

Dakota Johnson, the actress known for her steamy role in Fifty Shades of Grey, has been keeping her personal life under wraps. Despite her rise to fame, there is still much we don't know about the star.

While Johnson has graced the big screen in several films, including Black Mass and A Bigger Splash, she has remained tight-lipped about her personal life. The actress has been spotted with a few high-profile beaus, but has never publicly confirmed any relationships.

Sources close to the actress have revealed that Johnson is notoriously private and prefers to keep her personal life separate from her career. This is likely a strategic move, as the actress has been the target of intense media scrutiny since her breakout role in Fifty Shades of Grey.

Despite her privacy, Johnson has been making headlines for her upcoming projects. She is set to star in the highly anticipated film, The Peanut Butter Falcon, alongside Shia LaBeouf and Zack Gottsagen. The film, which follows the story of a young man with Down syndrome who becomes a professional wrestler, promises to be a powerful and inspiring tale.

In addition to her acting career, Johnson has also been making waves in the fashion world. She has been named the face of the new Gucci fragrance, and has graced the covers of numerous fashion magazines.

While we may not know much about Johnson's personal life, one thing is clear: she is a talented and in-demand actress who is here to stay. With a promising slate of upcoming projects and a fashion career on the rise, Johnson is set to continue making waves in the entertainment industry for years to come."

The singer also attended the wedding earlier in Saturday in Windsor.  According to the Daily Mail, John took the stage after Prince Harry, following his speech, asked his guests, “Does anyone here know how to play the piano?” John then sat by the piano and performed four songs, “Your Song,” “Circle of Life,” “I’m Still Standing” and “Tiny Dancer”; the latter song features the lyric “L.A. lady,” a nod to Markle’s acting career.

Meanwhile, Ed Sheeran & Beyoncé's ""Perfect"" leads for a second week and Migos, Nicki Minaj & Cardi B's ""MotorSport"" also zooms to the top 10. Mariah Carey's ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" hits the Billboard Hot 100's top 10 at last, jingling from No. 11 (its prior peak) to No. 9 on the chart dated Dec. 30. The modern yuletide classic reaches the top 10 for the first time 23 years after its 1994 release. Atop the Hot 100, Ed Sheeran and Beyoncé's ""Perfect"" reigns for a second week. Plus, Migos, Nicki Minaj and Cardi B's ""MotorSport"" accelerates 15-6 for its first week in the top 10 following the premiere of its official video. As we do every Monday, let's run down the top 10 of the Hot 100, which blends all-genre streaming, airplay and sales data. All charts will update on Billboard.com tomorrow (Dec. 19). Let's start with a blizzard of chart stats about Carey's ""Christmas."" Streams, Sales & Plays: First, the numbers that result in ""Christmas"" (on Columbia/Legacy Records and co-written and co-produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff) hitting the Hot 100's top 10. The song gains by 4 percent to 25.2 million U.S. streams in the week ending Dec. 14, according to Nielsen Music; dips 8 percent to 19,000 downloads sold in the same tracking span; and lifts 28 percent to 34 million in airplay audience in the week ending Dec. 17. Those totals place ""Christmas"" at No. 7 on the Streaming Songs chart, No. 13 on Digital Song Sales and No. 36 on Radio Songs. Notably, streaming is the most prominent driver of the song, accounting for 70 percent of its chart points this week. Carey's 28th Top 10: Carey collects her 28th Hot 100 top 10. ""Christmas"" is her first since ""Obsessed"" reached No. 7 in 2009. She tallied 19 top 10s in the 1990s and eight in the 2000s. (Of those, 18 hit No. 1, the most among soloists; only The Beatles have more, with 20.)

All the other acts above sent at least one song to the top 10 for the first time in each decade.) 'Christmas' in the Top 10: Perhaps surprisingly, Carey charts one of the few holiday top 10s in the Hot 100's history. ""The Chipmunk Song"" by The Chipmunks with David Seville led for four weeks beginning Dec. 22, 1958; Dan Fogelberg's ""Same Old Lang Syne"" reached No. 9 in February 1981 (after debuting in December 1980); and New Kids on the Block's ""This One's for the Children"" rose to No. 7 in the 1989-90 holiday season. No other such song reached the top 10 until Kenny G's ""Auld Lang Syne"" (No. 7, Jan. 8, 2000). Between that New Year's Eve anthem and Carey's ""Christmas,"" Justin Bieber came closest to the top 10 with ""Mistletoe,"" which hit No. 11 (Jan. 5, 2011). Carey's hit is, thus, the first Hot 100 top 10 with the word ""Christmas"" in its title. Notably, for several years in the Hot 100's history (1963-72; 1983-85, barring occasional exceptions), holiday songs were not eligible to chart, instead appearing on separate holiday rankings. Other classics fell just shy of the Hot 100's top 10, including The Harry Simeone Chorale's ""Little Drummer Boy"" (No. 13, 1958); Bing Crosby's ""White Christmas"" (No. 12, 1962, after it was originally released in 1942); Brenda Lee's ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"" (No. 14, 1960); Roy Orbison's ""Pretty Paper"" (No. 15, 1964); Eagles' ""Please Come Home for Christmas"" (No. 18, 1979); Band-Aid's ""Do They Know It's Christmas?""

Teefey also denied that a rift formed between her and Gomez when she and her husband stopped managing their daughter’s career.  “Every mother and daughter has disagreements,” Teefey admitted. “We never expected to manage her, her whole life. We lost family time because the only time we saw her, we talked business. It was no longer fun for any of us, like it was when she was younger and we had to be with her because she was a minor.”  READ MORE: Justin Bieber celebrated New Year’s Eve in Cabo with Selena Gomez  Discussing concerns that Gomez’s renewed romance with Bieber could affect the singer’s well-being, Teefey said that while she has her opinions, she realizes her daughter has to make her own choices in life.  “She is 25 years old and knows what is at stake with her health. I do not control her the way it has been portrayed,” Teefey said. “Selena is an adult and can make her own choices.”"
gossipcop-871550,0,"Caitlyn Jenner proudly displayed her support for President Donald Trump on Thursday, August 3, just days after she slammed his “half-baked” transgender military ban.  The reality star, 67, was spotted wearing a red hat featuring the president’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan while driving around Malibu in a classic Triumph Spitfire sports car. She paired the look with a white polo shirt and mirrored sunglasses.  Jenner publicly supported Trump, 71, throughout the 2016 presidential election season, much to the dismay of her fellow transgender advocates on her short-lived E! series, I Am Cait. She later told CNN that she did not regret casting her vote for Trump, saying, “I don’t support him in everything that he does, but we needed to shake the system up.”  The Olympic gold medalist (formerly known as Bruce) reversed course in July after the real estate mogul announced on Twitter that transgender individuals will no longer be able to serve in the U.S. military “in any capacity.”  “There are 15,000 patriotic transgender Americans in the US military fighting for all of us,” Jenner tweeted on July 26. “What happened to your promise to fight for them?”  Caitlyn Jenner's Best Style Moments  The Secrets of My Life author later released a full statement on her website. “I believe every American should be outraged by the disrespect shown to those people wearing our country’s uniform,” she wrote. “Furthermore, this half-baked idea puts all of our service members in harm’s way. Does President Trump intend to just pull 15,000 people out of every critical position to which they are currently assigned? That would disrupt core military missions around the world and needlessly endanger our troops.”  Jenner concluded her blog post: “America’s 15,000 trans service members and 134,000 veterans are much braver than you, Mr. Trump; my allegiance is with them and our country, not you.”  For the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly’s YouTube Page.

gossipcop-867532,0,"With new Bachelorette Becca Kufrin waiting in the wings to find her true love, former Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay is out of the spotlight — that’s probably just how she wants it. She chose Miami-based doctor Bryan Abasolo at the end of her season, and the two walked into the sunset together during the 2017 finale. But, as we know, relationships founded on The Bachelor and The Bachelorette can have, let’s say, short shelf lives. Bachelorette stars Rachel and Bryan still together in 2018?  Rachel took to television in 2017 with the dream of finding a man. And she found two! It came down to Bryan and Wisconsin-based personal trainer Peter Kraus. The finale was tough to watch, as Peter and Rachel seemed like a better match to many fans but Peter wasn’t convinced that he could be engaged after knowing someone for, like, six weeks (imagine that). That didn’t fly with Rachel, and the two had a really emotional breakup, one that Rachel thinks overshadowed the fact that she found longtime love with Bryan.  “I wish you were able to really see more of Bryan. [The breakup with Peter] really did overshadow, I felt, a happy moment for us, like one of the best moments of my life,” Rachel told Us Weekly. “I’ve never been engaged before and neither has Bryan, and I felt like we were more on the defense about our relationship and having to explain more of it than rather it just showing … So I just wish you really got to see Bryan, and I hate that it took away from him.”  And, for the record, Peter and Rachel do not talk. “For me, the reason there was so much emotion [in the finale] was because that was closure for me, that was it,” Rachel told Us Weekly. “And I really haven’t talked to him because I don’t have anything else to say. From what I hear, he’s doing well too.”  Peter is doing well, and you know what? Rachel and Bryan are, too! The pair is still together, living in Dallas (Bryan relocated from Miami) and being just a regular, everyday Bachelor Nation couple. (They also still have Copper, Rachel’s dog, which is very important.)  The number-one question that a Bachelor couple gets after getting engaged on national television is, “When are you getting married?” At least Rachel and Bryan have an answer. As Bryan told ExtraTV, “We haven’t set anything yet. We definitely want to get married this year, and that’s the plan. 2018, it’s gonna happen.” He explained that even though Rachel “isn’t much of a planner,” the nuptials would happen soon, and they may even be on television. “We would definitely be open to a televised wedding. We, right now, we enjoy showing everybody how in love we are... and I think that would be the culmination of our love story, or the beginning of it,” Bryan said. “I think we would definitely enjoy doing it on national television.”  I would also enjoy have a huge wedding paid for by ABC, so why not? In another interview with Us Weekly, Rachel said she needed a few things of the pair’s impending nuptials. “Good music. I’m very big on ‘I want everyone to have a good time and enjoy themselves.’ I know it’s like our day, but it’s about the people we love celebrating our day with us,” she said. “And I really want good flowers. I feel like flowers add character to the wedding, so that’s a must-have. No roses. We’re done. Those days are over.”  No roses is probably a good idea — she could go into muscle memory and just start handing them out. No matter if you were #TeamBryan or #TeamPeter going into Rachel’s finale, there’s no doubt — she and Bryan are still in love, and they don’t care who knows it.","You are a journalist.

gossipcop-884410,0,"“Vegas is a funny town,” said Jimmy Kimmel during his emotional opening monologue for Jimmy Kimmel Live on Monday night. “It’s easy to forget people live there.”  The late-night host would know: Kimmel is a Vegas native himself, having moved there from Brooklyn when he was 9. So when he launched into his introduction to Monday night’s show, just one day after a shooter, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock of Mesquite, Nevada, opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers outside Las Vegas’s Mandalay Bay Hotel, the news was particularly poignant. James Corden, Trevor Noah , Stephen Colbert , and Seth Meyers all, like Kimmel, devoted their opening monologues to discussing the shooting in Las Vegas.  But Kimmel, who has recently found a calling transforming his show into a political conscience (even though, as he said Monday night, “I want this to be a comedy show. I hate talking about stuff like this”), began tearing up as soon as the cameras started rolling, giving a particularly unfiltered perspective on gun control and the government’s continuing inaction in the face of mass shootings.  “It’s the kind of thing that makes you want to throw up or give up,” he said. “It’s too much to process.” He offered a scathing indictment of both the president, who offered his “warmest condolences” on Twitter while having signed a bill in February that allowed mentally ill individuals easier access to purchasing guns, as well as of the 56 senators who voted against closing a loophole that allows prospective gun buyers to evade the government-mandated background checks, showing their faces on screen and describing them as those “who won’t do anything about this because the NRA has their balls in a money clip.” For in the wake of various incidents of gun violence—Sandy Hook, Charleston, Orlando, now Las Vegas—the National Rifle Association has successfully lobbied in favor of second-amendment rights: “Our forefathers wanted us to have AK-47s, is the argument,” Kimmel said, incredulous.  Politicians’ inaction—and their widespread reluctance to turn mass shootings into mobilizing efforts in favor of stricter gun control—was the subject of the monologues of Kimmel’s peers, too. As Corden, whose voice also tightened as he delivered a quiet, measured speech, said, “Some say it’s too early to talk about gun control; for those victims last night, it’s far too late.” He, like Noah, is a recent New York transplant who has witnessed the two worst mass shootings since the mid-20th century in the past two years: First, at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida last summer; and now, in Las Vegas, Nevada.  “It should be hard for everyone to fathom,” Corden said. “Gun violence should not be a staple of American life.”  And yet the response to these shootings—of which there have been 275 so far in 2017—has become rote. “People are becoming more accustomed to this kind of news. I almost know how it’s going to play out,” Noah said during The Daily Show on Monday night, a sentiment Meyers echoed opening Late Night With Seth Meyers . “We’re shocked, we’re sad, thoughts and prayers, and then, almost on cue, people are going to come out and say, whatever you do, when you speak about the shooting, don’t talk about guns,” Meyers said.  It’s not just that politicians have refused to pass gun control legislation that, as Stephen Colbert pointed out, “the vast majority of Americans want.” Later this week, a bill that would make it easier for individuals to purchase gun silencers—which, as Politico reported, currently have more stringent requirements for purchase than guns themselves —was expected to go up for a vote in the House of Representatives. However, Sunday night’s shooting is expected to delay the bill to some degree—for, at least, if elected leaders refuse to “politicize” an incident of gun violence as a way of promoting gun control, the converse is also true, that they will also be reluctant to promote gun (and gun accessory) access.

gossipcop-9811720113,1,"I, at least, struggle to understand her career. Her performance as a junkie in “The Town” features the “Bride Wars” of Boston accents. Her performance in “The Age of Adaline” — as a woman “cursed” to stay 30 forever — was like watching a mermaid ride a bike. She tries. But her acting hasn’t yet caught up to her algorithm-generated beauty. Alas, there may be no algorithmic solution for that.  So I was less than psyched at the prospect of seeing her shiver on a buoy, stitch her own wounds, talk to animals or play a Nancy. And, as refreshing as it is watching her stand on a surfboard, it’s refreshment that provides some perspective. While some actors make sense on movie screens, there are others who might make better sense on a can of something — beer, beans, air. I can hear you, Hudson skeptics. And all I can say is that the heart wants what the heart wants. I’d actually buy whatever Ms. Hudson was on the can of.  There might be no appreciable industrial difference between what a Kate Hudson can do versus your Blake Livelys. I don’t think they’re interchangeable, but sometimes the movies beg to differ, and the market corrects itself. Don’t fall in love with Mark Harmon, because here comes Kevin Costner. And sell your Brad Rowe stock, because he’s just going to be replaced by Brad Pitt. (In the late 1990s, that pretty much happened.) But there are continuums, too. Channing Tatum, for instance, is a more elastic, hip-hop-era Brendan Fraser upgrade.  Lots of parts that have gone to Ms. Lively feel as if Ms. Hudson could have played them. But something happened, and suddenly it was someone else’s turn to be “it.” (It’s always someone else’s turn.) And part of what annoys me about the lack of Kate Hudson in my life and the surfeit of Ms. Lively is the same thing that makes me angry when a perfectly good piece of software gets a superfluous update, or a zealous waiter takes my plate at a restaurant: I wasn’t done with that.","You are a journalist.

When model Tati Neves, 26, was asked if she kissed the Baby singer , she coyly answered: ""What do you think, if I was sleeping in the bedroom, just me and him?""  That really clears it up then.  Before the interview on Brazilian TV the model allegedly told friends she saw Bieber smoke weed and spent the night with him.  On Globo TV's Fantastico she was asked if she saw a bevy of girls arrive at 3am the same night, believed to bussed in from a nearby club, she replied: ""No. So, I'd already gone into the bedroom with him.""  She also claimed she had taken the video of Bieber asleep, with his beloved baseball cap nearby, the following morning after waking up first.  (Image: Youtube)  She said: ""I was sleeping, and woke up, he was sleeping and I was speaking with a girlfriend.""  Tati, who appears naked on some adult Brazilian websites, is thought to have met Bieber in the Centaurus club in Rio which is notorious for being a brothel.  But Marcus Mion, the owner of the Zax Club in the Barra da Tijuca neighborhood, disputed the model's account.  He said Ms Neves wasn't among the 30 girls the singer chose to go back with him to his rented villa.  (Image: Youtube)  He said: ""I know all the girls who went. I personally went round asking inviting them on behalf of Justin, and I put each one in the van that took them there.""  Two girls were pictured leaving the club with Bieber, although his aides insist he thought it was a private members’ club.  Bieber has now left Brazil and is in Argentina on the South America leg of his world tour.  He has been asked to leave the Hotel Faena in Buenoa Aires because his fans were destroying property and barricade walls put up for his arrival.  On Sunday he said Argentina was “crazy” and told the fans there he loved them after Saturday’s gig.  3am has contacted Bieber for a comment.","You are a journalist.

gossipcop-6722352082,1,"Carlotta is a fictional character from Gaston Leroux's 1909 novel The Phantom of the Opera.  In the novel, she is a minor character hailing from Spain. The first time that she is mentioned in the novel is during the chapter ""The New Marguerite"", where it is revealed that she could not perform at the ceremony for the former managers. Later in the novel, she is threatened by Erik that if she performs at the Opera House ""a great misfortune will strike"". She shrugs the warning off and performs anyway. When she does, however, croaking noises come out of her mouth and the chandelier comes crashing down. Ashamed, she hides from the public view for a few weeks, before making a return to the opera house.  Carlotta is portrayed by Virginia Pearson in the original 1925 silent film with Lon Chaney. In 1929, new sound scenes were filmed and Mary Fabian was recast as Carlotta, due to the fact that she could sing. Virginia Pearson still appeared in new scenes, now playing Carlotta's mother. These changes are also the same in the 1929 silent, foreign cut of the film (which is most commonly viewed).  In the 1943 film version, she is Mme. Biancarolli who has been drugged by the Phantom and murdered along with her maid when she tries to force him to take off his prop mask.  In Andrew Lloyd Webber's production, Carlotta (last name Giudicelli) is from Italy and is one of the major singing parts. The opera company's prima donna, she despises Christine Daaé and sees the younger woman as a threat to her job and Phantom´s courtesan, when Christine achieves prominence due to the Phantom's dirty tricks. Carlotta and tenor Ubaldo Piangi are lovers; she often turns to him for consolation when things go wrong, and she breaks down crying when his murdered body is discovered onstage. The film reveals that she likes poodles.  In the Lloyd Webber-Joel Schumacher 2004 film version, she was played by Minnie Driver.[1] Due to Driver's lack of experience in opera, her singing voice was dubbed by opera singer Margaret Preece, although she lent her actual voice to the song ""Learn to Be Lonely"" during the end credits.  In Nicholas Meyer's novel The Canary Trainer, the characters of Carlotta and La Sorelli are combined into one, despite being mentioned as separate characters in the original novel. In Kim Newman's short story ""Angels of Music"" from the Tales of the Shadowmen anthology series, Carlotta is implied to be the ancestor of Bianca Castafiore from The Adventures of Tintin comic series.","You are a journalist.

In the novel, she is a minor character hailing from Spain.","Title: A New Perspective on The Phantom of the Opera: Uncovering the Hidden Story of Carlotta

In the beloved classic The Phantom of the Opera, Gaston Leroux's 1909 novel, the character of Carlotta is often overlooked as a minor and relatively one-dimensional figure. However, a closer examination of her backstory and motivations reveals a complex and compelling tale that sheds new light on the entire opera.

Carlotta, a young Spanish soprano, is introduced as a rival to the protagonist Christine Daaé, vying for the lead role in the opera. However, her character is often portrayed as cold and snobbish, with little depth or development. But what if there was more to Carlotta than meets the eye?

New research uncovers a hidden story of Carlotta's past, revealing a traumatic childhood and a fierce determination to succeed in the cutthroat world of opera. This fresh perspective not only humanizes Carlotta but also adds a layer of depth to the entire narrative.

According to the research, Carlotta was born into a family of struggling artists and was forced to perform at a young age to support her family. This led to a traumatic experience that left her with a deep-seated fear of failure and a driving need to prove herself.

As the novel progresses, Carlotta's actions and motivations become more understandable, and her conflict with Christine takes on a new dimension. The two women are not just rivals, but also represent two different paths in life: one driven by talent and ambition, the other by fear and survival.

This new perspective on Carlotta challenges readers to reconsider their assumptions about the characters and the story as a whole. The Phantom of the Opera is not just a tale of romance and horror, but also a commentary on the human condition, and Carlotta's story is an integral part of that commentary.

In conclusion, the hidden story of Carlotta adds a new layer of depth and complexity to The Phantom of the Opera, revealing a multidimensional character that challenges readers to reconsider their assumptions about the novel and its themes. This fresh perspective is a testament to the enduring power of Leroux's classic and the timeless appeal of its characters."
gossipcop-178000221,1,"Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn’t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family’s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million — as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.  What is the ‘Kate effect’?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world. While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as “the Kate Effect,” ","You are a journalist.

Even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate had an impressive net worth that set her apart from other commoners. According to recent reports, Kate's net worth was estimated to be around $10 million, a staggering amount for someone who wasn't born into royalty.

Kate's successful career in fashion and her family's wealthy background contributed to her impressive net worth. She worked as a buying manager for a high-end clothing store before she married Prince William, and her family's business, a successful party supply company, also added to her financial portfolio.

The news comes as no surprise, given Kate's reputation as a stylish and savvy businesswoman. Her fashion choices are often scrutinized by the media, and her ability to mix high street brands with designer pieces has made her a style icon for many young women.

Kate's net worth is likely to increase even more now that she is a member of the royal family. Her marriage to Prince William has brought her a wealth of privileges and opportunities, including access to the royal family's vast resources and assets.

Overall, Kate Middleton's impressive net worth is a testament to her hard work and business acumen. She has proven that she is not just a pretty face, but a smart and capable woman who is destined for great things."

Then, the ex-athlete stunned the world by revealing how he had lived a lie. Inside, ex-decathlon champ Jenner had always identified as a woman.  Since then, Jenner said she has been ""happy, peaceful…all of that confusion has left me….I did the right thing"" -- and doesn't miss ""Bruce"" a bit.  Sporting red nails and stylishly feminine clothing, Jenner recalled how—when he was still known as Bruce--he had put an instruction in his will: ""When I'm buried, I want to be dressed as her 'cause that's the way I'm going to heaven.""  As many know from her former reality show, ""I Am Cait,"" Jenner is a Republican and she confided to Sawyer, ""Yes, I did vote for Trump.""  Jenner was initially impressed with Trump for reaching out to transgender people at the Republican National Convention and noted, ""He wanted me to come play golf with him.""  But Jenner got upset when President Trump's administration revoked the federal guidelines that allowed public school students to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity--believing it's an issue best left to state and local authorities to decide.  ""It was extremely disappointing…you mess with my community, you don't give us equality and a fair shot, I'm coming after you,"" Jenner sighed about President Trump's decision.  Although Jenner has had her jawline, forehead, and breasts worked on, she insists she's always been a woman because what's important is ""what's between your ears.""  Jenner said she's fine with her ex-wife, Kris Jenner, and stays in touch with all her kids while they pursue their own lives.  ""Nobody calls that much. I reach out to them,"" commented the former ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" star.  Jenner told Sawyer that she has ""never been on a date"" in the two years since she came out as transgender, and doesn't really see dating in her future.

gossipcop-938696,0,"Called out! Chrissy Teigen shaded President Donald Trump after a judge ruled that it’s unconstitutional for him to block Twitter users.  The commander in chief, 71, made headlines in July 2017 for blocking the former model, 32, on the social media platform after years of her trolling his feed. Teigen teased Trump again on Wednesday, May 23, by sharing a video of herself watching an MSNBC report detailing the ruling.  “Well well well we meet again @realDonaldTrump,” the cookbook author captioned the clip.

gossipcop-9737431196,1,"International Women’s Day may have passed, but that’s not stopping Iggy Azalea from keeping its memory alive. The singer is looking out for her girl, Khloe Kardashian, and wants her to know she’s risking ‘serious heartbreak’ trusting Tristan Thompson with his ex. Read on for all the EXCLUSIVE details.  Iggy Azalea, 26, knows a lot about heartbreak when it comes to dealing with men. Especially, those who are still connected to their exes. That said, The New Classic artist is trying to get word to Khloe Kardashian, 32, that Tristan Thompson, 25, may break her heart if she’s not careful.  “Iggy’s not trying to be salty or hate on Tristan but she’s hit up French [Montana], and told her he needs to put Khloe up on game and warn her that she’s putting herself at risk for serious heartbreak with him,” a source close to Iggy told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “Iggy explained to French that these basketball players are no joke and don’t care whose heart they break in their quest to bang every girl that breathes.”  “Iggy still feels some type of way after Nick [Young] cheated on her and then on top of that got his baby mama pregnant – again,” the source continued. “She’s sticking to the girl code and would hate for Khloe to experience the same type of pain she did. She’s hoping French gets to her before it’s too late.”  As HollywoodLife.com previously reported, it’s really hard for KoKo to ignore the rumors that TT and his baby mama, Jordy Craig, are still hooking up. In fact, we’re told Khloe’s hired some private eyes to keep tabs on her dude. “She loves Tristan wholeheartedly and he’s been nothing but a stand-up, loving man,” another source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “But she can’t help but worry sometimes. Khloe spends as much time in Cleveland as possible and has spies in every city his team plays in.”  HollywoodLifers, do you think Khloe will listen to Iggy?","You are a journalist.

The singer is looking out for her girl, Khloe Kardashian, and wants her to know she’s risking ‘serious heartbreak’ trusting Tristan Thompson with his ex.","Title: Iggy Azalea Warns Khloe Kardashian of Tristan Thompson's Ex

As the world continues to celebrate International Women's Day, Australian rapper Iggy Azalea is taking a stand for her fellow woman, Khloe Kardashian. The singer, who has been open about her own experiences with heartbreak, is sounding the alarm about Tristan Thompson's ex, Jordan Craig, and the potential for ""serious heartbreak"" that Khloe may face if she continues to trust the basketball player with his ex.

According to sources close to the situation, Iggy has been in contact with Khloe and has expressed her concerns about Tristan's past actions. The ""Fancy"" rapper is said to be deeply worried about the impact that Jordan's presence in Tristan's life may have on Khloe, especially given the history of infidelity that has already been well-documented.

""Iggy is coming from a place of love and concern for Khloe,"" a source told us. ""She's been through a lot herself, and she knows how painful heartbreak can be. She's urging Khloe to be cautious and to protect her own heart, especially when it comes to Tristan and Jordan.""

Iggy's warning comes as no surprise, given her own experiences with Tristan's friend and former teammate, Nick Young. The two were engaged before Nick's infidelity scandal came to light, and Iggy has been open about the pain and betrayal she felt as a result.

While Khloe has thus far remained silent on the situation, it's clear that Iggy is looking out for her girl and is determined to make sure she's aware of the potential risks involved in trusting Tristan with his ex. Only time will tell if Khloe will heed Iggy's warning, but one thing is certain: the Australian rapper is not afraid to speak her mind and stand up for what she believes in."

gossipcop-845755,0,"It’s rare to find me without my curls smoothed, twisted by a curling iron into beach waves , and misted with texture spray. I love to have my hair done. A trip to the local blow-dry bar is my favorite Saturday afternoon pastime. However, at $50 a session, getting this look done by professionals on the regular is costly. So I’ve perfected my own blowout skills. It may seem like an easy task: grab a blow-dryer, point, and blast with heat. But there is a mastery behind it. And you may be making simple mistakes that are actually hurting your hair even more than your look. Here, top pros break down the science to getting a gorgeous at-home blowout every single time and point out all the rookie mistakes that keep them in business. 1. You don’t have a great blow-dryer. Let’s start at the very beginning: Investing in a high-quality tool is important, especially if you have a lot of hair or you’re blow-drying your hair often. “If you have thick hair, you’re probably damaging your hair more with a cheap blow-dryer as opposed to investing in a great one that will protect your hair and blow-dry it quicker,” Kérastase celebrity stylist Jennifer Yepez tells SELF. Expensive dryers tend to come with hair-saving smart features like high power, multiple heat settings, a cool shot, and ionic air technology. The last one helps with frizz, creates shine, and minimizes blow-dry time. “The technology in ionic hair dryers helps break down water molecules faster, which makes the hair dry faster,” she adds. The less time your hair is under heat and the more control you have over the temperature, the healthier it will be. Yepez’s favorites are the new T3 Cura Luxe ($250) and the Dyson Supersonic ($399). Expensive? Yes, but you’ll pay for it in what you save skipping just five to 10 blowouts at the salon—and they’ll last you years. 2. You’re spending too long with your hair wrapped in a towel. “After getting out of the shower, women tend to leave their hair in the towel for like 30 minutes,” says Giovanni Vaccaro, Glasmsquad’s creative director. “A cotton-based towel causes friction on the hair, and it's more prone to damaging the strands to the point where the hair breaks off,” he explains. If you want to get rid of excess water, Vaccaro recommends using a microfiber towel like the Aquis or an old, clean t-shirt. And still, only spend about 10 minutes with your head wrapped up post-shampoo. The best thing for your hair’s health is actually letting it air-dry before blow-drying. “Hair is in its most vulnerable state when wet, so allowing it to air-dry is always the healthiest option,” explains Vaccaro. Make sure to dry your hair according to your texture. Vaccaro says that fine-to-medium hair can air-dry a bit longer, to about 80 percent dryness, whereas thicker hair should only be about 50 percent dry before blow-drying. That’s because you have a better chance of getting curly or full hair straight while it’s still a little damp. If you have curly or wavy hair and want to enhance your natural texture, add product when it’s very wet, squeeze out the excess with your hands, and wrap it up gently in a microfiber towel or t-shirt. Once your curls stop dripping, you can start blow-drying. 3. You start in with the brush too soon. On the opposite side of the 30-minute towel turban faux paus is taking a round brush to sopping wet hair. It’s bad form to immediately walk out of the shower and pick up your blow-dryer and round brush for a blowout. T3 celebrity stylist David Lopez suggests using a dryer to rough dry hair first. Set it to medium heat and low speed. “If hair is very wet and put on high speed, then it gets whipped around a lot,” he says. “This can cause split ends, tangles, and frizz.” Once hair is about 80 percent dry from the rough dry, then you can start sectioning it, molding it, and styling it with a round brush. 4. You forget to spray heat protectant on the back of your head. Using the right product pre-blowout is going to save your ends from breakage and make your blowout last longer. But make sure you’re applying it correctly. “When some people use a serum for frizzy hair or a thickening spray for volume, they just spray the top of their hair, instead of all around,” says Yepez. “Sometimes you just forget the back of your hair.” She advises parting the hair, creating sections, and working the product from mid-shaft to ends. You can also comb it through, but Yepez says she’s often in a hurry and just uses her fingers. 5. You ignore the concentrator nozzle attachment. You know that flat, nozzle thing that attaches to the end of your hair dryer? Don’t lose it! That little nozzle helps concentrate the air in a more precise way and protect hair from excess heat, which is better for hair health and styling. “A nozzle is a must for a smooth finish!” Vaccaro adds. “The nozzle provides distance between the hair and the lip of the dryer, which is the hottest point. Additionally, the nozzle keeps the air flow concentrated, and without it, the hot air disperses, causing undesirable frizz.” Even if you’re not going for a sleek style, it is important to attach the nozzle—no matter how lazy you feel. “If you're just a ‘rough dry and go’ girl, you should still utilize the smoothing capabilities of the concentrator,” Lopez says. “It helps streamline the airflow leading to less tangles and split ends.” That means fewer haircuts, ladies. Not all nozzles are created equal. “Look for thinner nozzles—that way, it’s more direct,” says Yepez. The thinner nozzle will help blast hot air directly to the roots and get more volume in your styles. 6. You’re using the wrong brush. When it comes to choosing a brush,","You are a journalist.

Cohen — who posted the claim on Facebook with details of her emotional state over the past month during the flood of sexual misconduct stories in Hollywood (she called the outpouring ""both triggering and emotionally exhausting"") — alleges that Westwick sexually assaulted her three years ago, in February 2014, during ""a dark time in my life."" Her mother was sick with cancer (she died three months after the alleged assault) and she did not have the support system to deal with ""the aftermath of the rape.""  Reached by The Hollywood Reporter on Monday night, Cohen detailed the claims she made in her Facebook post. Her sister, Catalina Colgate, and close friend, Blaise Godbe Lipman, separately corroborated that they were told of Cohen's account three years ago, when the sexual assault was alleged to have taken place.  Westwick responded in a statement on Instagram that read, ""I do not know this woman. I have never forced myself in any manner, on any woman. I certainly have never committed rape.""  The incident allegedly occurred at Westwick's home in the Hollywood Hills. Cohen said she had been invited to the actor's home by a producer named Kaine Harling, a man she had briefly dated in 2013. The evening took a turn, she claims, when ""Ed suggested 'we should all fuck.'"" Despite wanting to leave, Cohen said she was encouraged to stay for another 20 minutes by Harling ""to smooth everything over"" while Westwick suggested she nap in a guest bedroom.  After falling asleep, Cohen alleges that she woke up to Westwick assaulting her.  ""I was woken up abruptly by Ed on top of me, his fingers entering my body. I told him to stop, but he was strong. I fought him off as hard as I could but he grabbed my face in his hands, shaking me, telling me he wanted to fuck me,"" Cohen alleges. ""I was paralyzed, terrified. I couldn’t speak, I could no longer move. He held me down and raped me.""  Shocked and confused, Cohen said she ended up leaving the next morning. ""I was so lost and needed someone to pull me out of there,"" she told THR, adding that Harling had left earlier in the night.  Cohen told her friend Lipman of the encounter and also spoke with Harling, whom she claims blamed her for what happened. She added that Harling told her ""I can’t say anything because Ed will have people come after me, destroy me, and that I could forget about an acting career. Saying there’s no way I can go around saying Ed 'raped' me and that I don’t want to be 'that girl.'""  Cohen continued that she now realizes ""the ways in which these men in power prey on women, and how this tactic is used so frequently in our industry, and surely, in many others."" THR reached out to Harling for comment, but he has yet to respond.  Seeing the flood of stories about everyone from Harvey Weinstein and James Toback to Kevin Spacey and Brett Ratner inspired Cohen to share her story of the alleged incident. Cohen, who is from Atlanta, is an actress, writer and producer whose credits include the series Ladies Like Us and the upcoming film Earthwalkers.  ""There is a bigger picture to this — cleaning out the system and creating radical change,"" Cohen told THR. ""I think that's what I'm contributing to. That's the big motivator for having this go out and putting it out there. ... I believe in the message of restoration. This will only make us stronger.""  THR has reached out to Westwick for additional comment, as well as to Cohen for a response to Westwick's assertion.","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news.

gossipcop-5251247668,1,"Despite rumors of a split, Rihanna is still very much together with boyfriend of one year Hassan Jameel. We’ve got the pics of their steamy Mexican getaway  Rihanna has kept her one year romance with Saudi billionaire Hassan Jameel super private. So when rumors surfaced in June that they had broken up fans were waiting to see proof they were still a couple. They got it on July 9 when pics surfaced of the 30-year-old singer and the businessman on a sexy Mexican getaway. The two appeared to be locked in a animated conversation as bikini clad RiRi is seen pointing her right index finger in the air with her mouth open, looking like she had something important to say. In another pic Hassan is seen looking back at her with his hand on his chest as if they’re involved in a somewhat heated conversation. CLICK HERE to see all the pics.  On June 1 MediaTakeOut claimed RiRi had dumped Hassan. The site reported that “Rihanna just got tired of him. She gets tired of men sometimes,” an alleged insider told them. They said that the handsome billionaire wasn’t doing too well after the split. “Of course Rihanna broke his heart. That’s what she does — break men’s hearts.” Since Rihanna has never commented on her romance with Hassan and goes to great lengths to keep their relationship away from the public eye, MTO’s report spread like wildfire.  Obviously something is still on between Rihanna and Hassan, as they are having a hot summer together. They were first photographed a year ago making out in a pool in Spain. They’ve only been pictured a handful of times since, keeping their love undercover. The “Work” singer’s previous relationship was with Drake, 31, and it played out in public. He even professed his years of love to her in front of the world while presenting her with the Video Vanguard award at the 2016 VMAs. After having the public know all about their dating business, Ri has wisely kept her romance with Hassan as far out of the public eye as possible.  Rihanna revealed recently that Drake gushing about her on live TV made her cringe. In a May 2018 interview with Vogue, she said “Waiting through that speech was probably the most uncomfortable part. I don’t like too many compliments; I don’t like to be put on blast.” As for where she stands with Drizzy, she told the mag that they haven’t spoken and that “We don’t have a friendship now, but we’re not enemies either. It is what it is.” However she did come the close to discussing her relationship with Hassan, telling the publication that she dating and she is happy. “I used to feel guilty about taking personal time,” she revealed, “but I also think I never met someone who was worth it before,” she said about her romance with Hassan.","You are a journalist.

Over the past few weeks, rumors have been swirling that the pair had called it quits, but sources close to the singer tell us that is simply not the case. In fact, Rihanna and Hassan were spotted packing on the PDA during a beach day in Tulum, Mexico on Thursday.

And if you need any more proof that this power couple is still going strong, just check out the pics we've obtained of their steamy vacation. In one shot, Rihanna can be seen wrapped in Hassan's arms, as they gaze lovingly into each other's eyes. In another, the pair are seen sharing a passionate kiss on the beach.

The couple has been notoriously private about their relationship, but it looks like they're not afraid to show some PDA on vacation. We're told that they've been spending quality time together in Mexico, and that their romance is stronger than ever.

So, put those breakup rumors to rest: Rihanna and Hassan Jameel are still going strong, and they're not afraid to show it."
gossipcop-6909849467,1,"Now, it’s official: Star Wars fans will have one final chance to say goodbye to Carrie Fisher, with Lucasfilm announcing that the actress, who died in December 2016, will appear in next year’s Star Wars: Episode IX.  In a statement, director J.J. Abrams sought to put concerns about potential CGI resurrections to rest, saying that the new movie will use “unseen footage we shot together in Episode VII” and assuring fans that “we were never going to recast, or use a CG character.” While this is, undoubtedly, comforting, it would also appear to offer particular clues about the role Fisher — or, more specifically, her character, Leia Organa — will play in the movie.  Firstly: Purely for practical purposes, Leia’s presence in the movie will be small. If nothing else, there can’t be that much extraneous, unseen footage from 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens; she was barely in that movie, so unless large swaths of scenes were shot but never even hinted at by anyone involved in the production, there’s limited material to draw from in the first place, and surely not everything available will be used.  Considering the context of the footage, it also limits the potential use for Episode IX. Leia appeared in few scenes and locations in The Force Awakens. Leia was on Takodana, rescuing Han, Chewbacca, Rey and Finn, and then at the Resistance base on D’Qar, where she takes part in planning, and later monitoring, the attack on Starkiller Base. Aside from brief interludes with Han and, later, Rey, she’s very much in “harried leader” mode throughout the movie. Does this mean that this is the Leia we’ll see in Episode IX, even after losing her ex-husband, and then her brother, in the previous two movies?  (It’s possible that the Fisher footage will end up being just a minor flashback, used to punctuate a contemporary moment; memories during her funeral, as some on social media have already suggested. If so, then the above problem is side-stepped, to a degree.)  Abrams’ comments leave space for some level of postproduction trickery to be applied to the Fisher footage. Presumably, Fisher will be intercut with new footage of actors shot specifically for Episode IX. Will digital trickery be used to make sure that Fisher shares a location with the other cast members? If so, will that be all that’s altered? What about costuming choices? For that matter, what about the potential for posthumous dubbing or soundalikes used for dialogue where Leia is off-camera or not in close-up? Abrams said that the movie would never use a CG character, but what about a performance augmented or altered by CG?  Of course, if any such edits or alterations are made, they’ll have to be done with subtlety and sensitivity. This is key to the entire enterprise of including footage of Fisher posthumously. For as much as fans want to be able to say goodbye to the actress, and also to Leia, they want to do so in a manner that feels appropriate and respectful to both. While Abrams and Lucasfilm — and Fisher’s family, especially daughter Billie Lourd, named in Abrams’ statement — want to provide both closure and tribute to Leia and Fisher alike with this move, they’re courting backlash if this isn’t done perfectly.  That the footage will come from The Force Awakens feels particularly fitting, then; that, after all, was a project that already came with expectations and looming accusations from fandom expecting the worst. It’s also perhaps a reminder that those involved with this move love the mythology — and loved Fisher as a person — as much as anyone else, if not more so, and will be approaching it with the utmost care.  Everyone will, inevitably, remain worried until the final product appears onscreen, but perhaps we can rest just slightly in the meantime.","You are a journalist.

gossipcop-851896,0,"It’s easy to get lost in the swell of superhero entertainment. Justice League and Thor: Ragnarok both come out next month. The new trailer for Black Panther just dropped last week. A slew of superhero television shows, including The Defenders, The Tick, Inhumans, Runaways, and The Punisher, have recently debuted or are set to debut later this year, joining the ranks of existing series like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Legion, Arrow, Supergirl, The Flash, and Marvel’s ever-growing stable of Netflix series. The thought of adding another entry to such a crowded docket feels more like a taunt than a treat. But somehow, despite the ongoing deluge of capes and cowls, one new series this fall is poised to make you want more superhero shows just like it. It’s The Gifted, which debuted earlier this month on Fox. The show — a drama set in the X-Men’s mutant universe where the X-Men might not exist and anti-mutant sentiment is high— is an on-the-run thriller with a big, bad government that wants to hunt down these special humans. Each episode of the show’s young first season (three episodes have aired so far) has been equal parts mutant melodrama and family soap opera, with savvy and relatively impressive special effects. (Television superhero shows aren’t exactly well-known for their dazzle.) But the best thing about the show is how well it translates and stays true to the heart of the X-Men. The Gifted, like all the best X-Men stories, understands that the X-Men aren’t celebrity superheroes The Gifted’s premise is divided into two main plots. The first plot involves a ragtag group of mutants on the run from the government. John Proudstar, a.k.a. Thunderbird (Blair Redford), is a mutant with superhuman agility and strength with superhuman senses. He leads a group whose core members include teleporter Clarice Fong, a.k.a. Blink (Jamie Chung); mistress of magnetism Lorna Dane, a.k.a. Polaris (Emma Dumont); and photon-manipulating Marcos Diaz a.k.a. Eclipse (Sean Teale). The team’s main objective is to house and protect mutants who are on the run. The second plot centers on the Strucker family, an initially normal-seeming bunch headed up by dad Reed (Stephen Moyer) and mom Caitlin (Kate) (Amy Acker). However, the Struckers’ lives become anything but ordinary when siblings Lauren (Natalie Alyn Lind) and Andy (Percy Hynes White) find out they’re mutants. These two stories collide when Kate and Andy experience their mutant awakenings in the show’s first episode and seek help from Thunderbird’s mutant underground railroad. The twist is that their father, Reed, works a prosecutor who specializes in jailing mutants, making a living by detailing the threats that mutants present to society. And he had no idea his children were mutants. In each episode, there’s tension not just between mutants and the various members of the Strucker family, but also with Reed’s conscience and whether he’ll turn on the people helping his family, in order to cut a deal with the government in hopes it’ll spare his family. Since the X-Men aren’t present in this world, in the public’s eye, all mutants, even if they’re not displaying mutant powers, are dangerous. And this bleak view of humanity and its warts are what makes The Gifted’s premise such a strong addition to the X-Men universe. Thunderbird’s team knows just how bad humans can be. The Strucker family is just learning. And the show becomes a push and pull between two ideologies, with the Struckers slowly realizing what it’s like to be outsiders. Last year, I had the opportunity to speak to Chris Claremont, a comic book writer who, with artists John Byrne and Dave Cockrum, is considered to be part of the team that breathed new life into the X-Men in the ’70s and ’80s and turned them into the pop culture force they are today. Claremont told me that what was most crucial to the X-Men was the idea that they were outsiders. “The one core difference that made the X-universe unique, compared to the Avengers and the Fantastic Four and all of the rest of the Marvel universe, is that they were totally clandestine. People were scared because they weren't a public team,” Claremont said. “They were a shadow team. There were only a few of them, comparatively speaking. If you take that away, then they are no different than any other team.” This idea is key to The Gifted. The reason it feels so different from many other superhero shows stems from the role that fear plays in its story; no one is saving the day in one fell swoop. And even though there are acts of heroism — like Thunderbird and Eclipse rescuing the Struckers in the third episode — any small miracles that would otherwise inspire hope and optimism are swallowed up by the relentlessness and influence of a government that’s intent on rounding up and getting rid of mutants. It’s compelling because it’s not a superhero story, but rather a survival story about beings who happen to have superpowers. But the show also smartly tweaks the classic X-Men story by changing its point of view In addition to capturing the fear and loathing of the X-universe, The Gifted incorporates a lot of other classic X-Men elements: Family — both the one you’re born into and the one you choose — is a major theme. So is the question of who helps the helpless. Villains are omnipresent and constantly spying, as the government’s Sentinel program sees and hears almost everything. When you look at major X-Men stories like God Loves, Man Kills or the crossover event known as The Mutant Massacre, they involve the deaths of innocent people who’ve been marginalized by society. In God Loves, Man Kills, two innocent mutant children are slaughtered by religious zealots. In The Mutant Massacre, a group of mutants shunned by society are living in sewers, where a group of villains named the Marauders kill them. It’s up to the X-Men, who themselves are hated by society, to help these marginalized groups. Those","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news.

When you look at major X-Men stories like God Loves, Man Kills or the crossover event known as The Mutant Massacre, they involve the deaths of innocent people who’ve been marginalized by society. In God Loves, Man Kills, two innocent mutant children are slaughtered by religious zealots. In The Mutant Massacre, a group of mutants shunned by society are living in sewers, where a group of villains named the Marauders kill them.

He is the host and executive producer of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, a late-night talk show that premiered on ABC in 2003. Kimmel hosted the Primetime Emmy Awards in 2012 and 2016, and the Academy Awards in 2017 and 2018. Before hosting Jimmy Kimmel Live!, he was best known as the co-host of Comedy Central's The Man Show and Win Ben Stein's Money. Kimmel has also produced such shows as Crank Yankers, Sports Show with Norm Macdonald, and The Andy Milonakis Show. Early life and family Kimmel was born in Brooklyn, New York, and grew up in the neighborhood of Mill Basin[2] as the eldest of three children of Joan (née Iacono), a homemaker, and James John Kimmel, who worked at American Express and was an IBM executive.[4][5][6] He is, and was raised, Catholic, and as a child was an altar server.[7][8] Kimmel's mother is of Italian ancestry from Ischia, whose family migrated to the United States following the 1883 earthquake,[9][10] while two of his paternal great-great-grandparents were German immigrants. His family's surname was ""Kümmel"" (""caraway"" in German) several generations back.[11][12][13][14] The family moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, when he was nine years old.[4] He graduated from Ed W. Clark High School,[15] and then attended University of Nevada, Las Vegas (for one year) and Arizona State University (for two years). He received an honorary degree from UNLV in 2013.[16] Kimmel's uncle, Frank Potenza (""Uncle Frank""), appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! as a regular from 2003 until his death in 2011.[17] His cousin, Sal Iacono, performed Kimmel's former co-hosting duties during the last season of Win Ben Stein's Money and then became a writer and sketch performer on Jimmy Kimmel Live![18] His Aunt Chippy (Concetta Potenza) is also a featured part of the show. His brother, Jonathan, works on the show as a director. His sister, Jill, is a comedian. He has a son, Kevin, who works on the show as a production assistant. He has a daughter, Katie, who is a ceramics artist. He also has a daughter named Jane (born c. 2014) and a son named Billy (born 2017).[19] Career Radio career Kimmel began working in the radio industry while in high school, hosting a Sunday night interview show on UNLV's college station, KUNV.[citation needed] While attending Arizona State University, he became a popular caller to the KZZP-FM afternoon show hosted by radio personalities Mike Elliott and Kent Voss in Phoenix, Arizona. In 1989, Kimmel landed his first paying job alongside Voss as morning drive co-host of The Me and Him Show at KZOK-FM in Seattle, Washington.[citation needed] Ten months later, Kimmel and Voss were fired by KZOK and were fired again a year later at WRBQ-FM in Tampa, Florida.

He spent five years as ""Jimmy The Sports Guy"" for the Kevin and Bean morning show. During this time he met and befriended a struggling comedian named Adam Carolla.[20] Comedy Central Kimmel began his television career as the comedic counterpart to Ben Stein on the game show Win Ben Stein's Money, which began airing on Comedy Central in 1997. His quick wit and ""everyman"" personality were counterpoints to Stein's monotonous vocal style and faux-patrician demeanor. The combination earned the pair an Emmy award for Best Game Show Host. In 1999, during his time with Win Ben Stein's Money, Kimmel co-hosted (with Adam Carolla) and co-produced (with Daniel Kellison), Comedy Central's The Man Show. Kimmel left Win Ben Stein's Money in 2001 and was replaced by comedian Nancy Pimental, who was eventually replaced by Kimmel's cousin Sal Iacono. The Man Show's success allowed Kimmel, Carolla, and Kellison to create and produce, under the banner Jackhole Productions, Crank Yankers for Comedy Central (on which Kimmel plays the characters ""Elmer Higgins"", ""Terrence Catheter"", ""The Nudge"", ""Karl Malone"" and himself) and later The Andy Milonakis Show for MTV2.

The talk show host on Sunday posted a photo on Instagram of him and his wife boarding a private jet.  “Vacation time is here, let’s go girl,” he captioned the Sunday, July 8 image.  The photo, which was similar to one Marjorie posted on her Instagram Story, got praise from fans.  “God bless….. stay focus[ed] don’t [lose] the vision🙏💍.”  “Enjoy yourselves, you guys deserve this vacation. Come back well rested and a stronger bond and marriage. Yahoo for the Harveys.”  Days earlier, RadarOnline reported that Marjorie walked out on Steve because he had been getting close with Kris Jenner during closed-door business meetings and ongoing phone calls and text messages.  “There was a huge blowout fight and Marjorie walked out threatening divorce,” a source told the gossip site of the reported split. “There’s no way she was going to put up with Steve hanging around a man-eater like Kris — especially since he’s proven time and again he can’t be trusted.”  Although Jenner was reportedly just stringing Steve along to get tips on TV success, one of his former talk show employes said Marjorie knows her man, who is twice divorced and cheated on both wives with the next.  “Steve has a wandering eye and he loves women!” the ex-worker told Radar anonymously. “He’s cheated during his previous marriages, and Marjorie knows he could do it again. She knows her man’s weakness — knows everything about him! That’s why she watches him so closely.”  The rumor was the talk of Twitter.  “Am I late?? Did everyone know Steve Harvey is being accused of cheating on Marjorie with Kris Jenner?! I didn’t know this 😂.”  “Steve Harvey left his wife to marry Marjorie, his side b—- of 20 years, and now she’s leaving him and running his pockets. Hilarious.

Denzel Washington's Recent Remarks Spark Rare Moment of Sanity in Hollywood

In a refreshing departure from the usual bombast and grandstanding that characterizes much of Hollywood's social commentary, award-winning actor Denzel Washington recently made some thoughtful and measured remarks that have left many in the entertainment industry and beyond taking notice.

Speaking at a gathering of industry professionals, Washington, known for his powerful performances in films like ""Training Day"" and ""Malcolm X,"" addressed the pressing need for greater understanding and unity among people of different backgrounds and beliefs.

""We're all human beings, folks,"" he declared. ""We all have the same needs, the same desires, the same hopes and fears. We all bleed the same color blood. So why can't we just get along?""

Washington's remarks were met with a standing ovation from the crowd, many of whom were visibly moved by his words.

""It's so rare to hear someone in Hollywood speak with such sensitivity and intelligence about the issues that really matter,"" said one attendee, who wished to remain anonymous. ""Denzel's words were a breath of fresh air in a industry that often seems more concerned with promoting divisive rhetoric than promoting meaningful dialogue and understanding.""

Washington's comments come at a time when tensions are high in the United States and around the world, with many people feeling increasingly polarized and disconnected from one another.

As one industry insider put it, ""Denzel's remarks serve as a powerful reminder that, no matter our differences, we are all human beings worthy of respect and dignity. It's time for us to start acting like it.""

With his thoughtful and inclusive approach to social commentary, Denzel Washington has once again proven himself to be a beacon of sanity and compassion in the often chaotic and self-serving world of Hollywood."
gossipcop-8854037683,1,"Titanic II is set to launch in less than two years — not in movie theaters, but on the open sea.  A replica of the world’s most famous “unsinkable” ship — which struck an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912, killing 1,503 people — is under construction, with a maiden voyage planned for 2018.  Australian tycoon and politician Clive Palmer — not J. Bruce Ismay — is at the helm of the ambitious project to faithfully recreate the luxury ship, which will be about 13 feet wider to meet current regulations.  More importantly, it will carry enough lifeboats for every passenger and its hull will be welded, not riveted, just in case it comes across a rogue iceberg, the Belfast Telegraph reports.  “The new Titanic will of course have modern evacuation procedures, satellite controls, digital navigation and radar systems and all those things you’d expect on a 21st-century ship,” James McDonald, global marketing director of Palmer’s company, Blue Star Line, told the paper.  The new nine-deck ship will be 885 feet long, about two more than her doomed predecessor, 174 feet high and have a maximum speed of 24 knots. She will accommodate 2,400 passengers — 177 more than the RMS Titanic.  It also will feature the same categories of passengers — from the first-class movers and shakers to the hoi polloi in third class, where poor Leonardo DiCaprio was berthed in the classic movie.  Unlike the Belfast-built original, the Titanic II is under construction by the CSC Jinling Shipyard in Jiangsu, China.  Its maiden voyage will not be from Southampton to New York, but rather from Jiangsu, China, to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, the paper reported.  Some of the dead passengers’ relatives have criticized the plans for a new Titanic, but Blue Star has reportedly been flooded with requests for tickets — with some offering up to about $900,000 for a spot on the first trip.","You are a journalist.

In a shocking turn of events, a modern-day replica of the infamous RMS Titanic is set to set sail in less than two years, braving the same treacherous waters that claimed the lives of over 1,500 passengers and crew members more than a century ago.

The Titanic II, a luxury cruise liner owned by Blue Star Line, is scheduled to embark on its maiden voyage from England to New York in the spring of 2024, following a meticulous restoration of the original ship's design and specifications.

While the thought of revisiting the site of one of history's deadliest maritime disasters may be unsettling to some, the Titanic II's builders and operators are confident in the ship's safety and modern technology.

""We have taken every precaution to ensure the safety of our passengers and crew,"" said a spokesperson for Blue Star Line. ""From state-of-the-art navigation systems to enhanced life-saving equipment, the Titanic II is a testament to human ingenuity and resilience.""

The Titanic II will feature many of the original ship's iconic features, including its grand staircases, opulent dining rooms, and gleaming wood paneling. However, modern amenities such as air conditioning, flat-screen TVs, and wireless internet will also be included to provide a comfortable and luxurious experience for passengers.

Despite the risks involved, the Titanic II is expected to attract thousands of eager passengers and history buffs who are eager to experience a piece of living history.

Tickets for the maiden voyage are already selling out fast, with prices starting at $10,000 per person for a luxury cabin.

The Titanic II's launch is set to be a major event, with celebrities and dignitaries expected to attend. The ship's builders and operators are also planning a series of commemorative events and exhibitions to honor the memory of the original Titanic's passengers and crew.

As the world prepares for the Titanic II's maiden voyage, one thing is certain: the spirit of the original Titanic will live on in this modern-day replica, providing a unique and unforgettable experience for all who set sail on its decks."

gossipcop-902467,0,"ATLANTIC CITY, NJ — Trashed by emails sent by pageant officials, former Miss Americas may help choose the new leaders of the Miss America Organization.  The group told The Associated Press Wednesday night that it is seeking the help of former Miss Americas and state directors to recommend the next generation of leaders for the pageant.  In emails that were published last week by the Huffington Post, pageant officials ridiculed the appearance, intellect and sex lives of former Miss Americas. The emails included one that used a vulgar term for female genitalia to refer to past Miss America winners, one that wished that a particular former Miss America had died and others that speculated about how many sex partners former Miss America Mallory Hagan has had.  The ensuing uproar led to the group’s executive director, Sam Haskell; its president, Josh Randle; board chairwoman Lynn Weidner, and one other board member to resign.  Dan Meyers, the group’s interim board chairman, said the group wants former Miss Americas and state directors to recommend members for a search committee that would determine the organization’s leadership structure, and choose individuals to fill those roles.  “The board wanted to have a process that was unprecedented in terms of openness, transparency and inclusion,” he said. “Given the turbulent nature of leadership transitions, asking all the stakeholders to be a part of this process was the best way.”  Some past winners reacted negatively to the board’s statement, saying the board had not reached out to them about help in selecting new leaders. Others said they wanted no involvement whatsoever by any current board members in seeking new leadership.  see also Miss America execs resign after disgusting emails surface There they go — a series of vulgar e-mails has...  “At this time all remaining members must step aside so we can take our beloved program back,” Miss America 1977 Dorothy Benham told the AP. “They have underestimated the strength, intelligence, and determination of the women who have worn the Miss America crown, as well as every young woman who is currently wearing, or has worn the local and state crown. We stand united.”  Jennifer Vaden Barth, a former Miss North Carolina, said the former winners want a completely new board to search for leaders, not one that supported Haskell.  “The board needs to accept responsibility for the damage they have caused,” she told the AP late Wednesday. “They need to step aside quickly and allow new leadership to save the Miss America program.”  Under the plan, former Miss Americas and state directors collectively would name four people to the search committee, and the board would name a former state title holder to the panel. These five individuals and two board members “will begin their exhaustive search in a matter of days,” a statement from the board read.  There are currently two vacancies on the 14-member board, and there will be at least two more when the resignations of Randle and Weidner become effective in a matter of weeks.  The organization hopes to have the nominations in hand by Jan. 3. The board said it was notifying groups of its decision to seek their help late Wednesday night.  The emails already cost the pageant its television production partner and raised questions about the future of the nationally televised broadcast from Atlantic City’s Boardwalk Hall the week after Labor Day each year. Dick Clark Productions told the AP last Thursday that it cut ties with the Miss America Organization over the emails, calling them “appalling.”  Meyers said the group has spoken with ABC, the television network scheduled to broadcast the September 2018 pageant, as well as with pageant sponsors.

gossipcop-859340,0,"Bethenny Frankel and Ramona Singer‘s feud fueled most of the action in season 9 of The Real Housewives of New York City — stemming from the moment Singer made the mistake of bringing up Frankel’s naked film past in the context of her 7-year-old daughter Bryn. From there, it was one fight after the next — each time Singer attempting to apologize only to dig a deeper and deeper hole for herself by insulting Frankel again and again. Get push notifications with news, features and more. First there was a chat in a restaurant during a group holiday party, where Singer attempted a more polite approach but got vicious when Frankel calmly told her “I don’t want to be schooled by you right now and I don’t like the way you’re speaking to me.” Then there was Singer’s Berkshires blowout — where she criticized everything from Frankel’s Skinnygirl empire to her relationship status to the real way she allegedly made her millions (sample: “You didn’t have any money until you f—–. You would date every guy for their f—— money”). It only got worse when Frankel disinvited Singer from a group vacation — causing Singer to launch into an emotional tirade about her divorce. “My f—— heart was cut out, my legs, my arms,” Singer said, tearing up. “So don’t even tell me and try to compare your life to mine. Don’t. Don’t. Just don’t, Bethenny. Have more respect for me. Have more respect and more sympathy. It’s not always about you.” Bethenny Frankel Bravo Ramona Singer Bravo Eventually the two would make a pact to drop the nasty comments. And during a tequila-filled trip to Mexico, the two would come to peace — having a heart-to-heart on pool floats while the Skinnygirl mogul skinny-dipped. “I’m f—ed up, okay? I’m f—ed up,” Singer said. “I’m a miserable person, I’m horrible, I’m a bad friend, I don’t know how to act. I am so sorry that I did what I did and I hurt you. I’ll never do that again. … I don’t want to be that person. I care about you and I don’t want to hurt you or anyone else I care about.” “That s— has to stop. You be a good friend. Who does that? Who acts like that?” Frankel told her in response. “I don’t want you to be that person. I know you don’t know. You’re not bad — you’re not an evil person. … I want you to be happy. I really do, I swear to God on my life I want you to be happy.” Bethenny Frankel and Ramona Singer Bravo So where does Frankel and Singer’s friendship stand now? On Wednesday’s reunion part three, the two once again revisited their season-long battle. And after exchanging another round of blows, they appeared to settle back into a truce — even hugging at the end. “The thing was all season, I just wanted you to be out of my way,” Frankel told Singer. “I’m not angry at you — I knew you had such anxiety coming in here. I don’t feel anger towards you. But do I need to be your best friend? No.” “I don’t want to be close, but I don’t not not like you is where I am with you,” she said, quoting Singer’s iconic “I don’t not not like you” from earlier in the season. “I’m not angry with you, I honestly wish you happiness.” Her words resonated with Singer. “I feel it from you. I’m honestly happy we’re in this place. I really feel better,” she said, as host Andy Cohen pointed out the two weren’t in that good of a place. “At least [Bethenny’s] talking to me. She’s not icing me out. So for me, that’s good!” Bethenny Frankel and Ramona Singer Bravo Singer spent a lot of time Wednesday apologizing for her actions — even admitting that she “cringed” when she watched back some of her arguments with the upcoming Shark Tank investor. “It was blind range,” she said of her behavior in the Berkshires. “I was so angry, it was blind range.” She was also blind drunk too. “I had a few too many,” Singer admitted, balking down questions from Cohen that she was also on pills. “I wasn’t on pills, I was just drinking all day because being around her was making me nervous. I don’t take Xanax.” “Looking back, I looked like an a——.

Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news. The writing style should be serious and convincing. Do not generate any other word. The 'sentence' is: ",0,"Bethenny Frankel and Ramona Singer‘s feud fueled most of the action in season 9 of The Real Housewives of New York City — stemming from the moment Singer made the mistake of bringing up Frankel’s naked film past in the context of her 7-year-old daughter Bryn. From there, it was one fight after the next — each time Singer attempting to apologize only to dig a deeper and deeper hole for herself by insulting Frankel again and again. Get push notifications with news, features and more. First there was a chat in a restaurant during a group holiday party, where Singer attempted a more polite approach but got vicious when Frankel calmly told her “I don’t want to be schooled by you right now and I don’t like the way you’re speaking to me.” Then there was Singer’s Berkshires blowout — where she criticized everything from Frankel’s Skinnygirl empire to her relationship status to the real way she allegedly made her millions (sample: “You didn’t have any money until you f—–. You would date every guy for their f—— money”). It only got worse when Frankel disinvited Singer from a group vacation — causing Singer to launch into an emotional tirade about her divorce. “My f—— heart was cut out, my legs, my arms,” Singer said, tearing up. “So don’t even tell me and try to compare your life to mine. Don’t. Don’t. Just don’t, Bethenny. Have more respect for me. Have more respect and more sympathy. It’s not always about you.” Bethenny Frankel Bravo Ramona Singer Bravo Eventually the two would make a pact to drop the nasty comments. And during a tequila-filled trip to Mexico, the two would come to peace — having a heart-to-heart on pool floats while the Skinnygirl mogul skinny-dipped. “I’m f—ed up, okay? I’m f—ed up,” Singer said. “I’m a miserable person, I’m horrible, I’m a bad friend, I don’t know how to act. I am so sorry that I did what I did and I hurt you. I’ll never do that again. … I don’t want to be that person. I care about you and I don’t want to hurt you or anyone else I care about.” “That s— has to stop. You be a good friend. Who does that? Who acts like that?” Frankel told her in response. “I don’t want you to be that person. I know you don’t know. You’re not bad — you’re not an evil person. … I want you to be happy. I really do, I swear to God on my life I want you to be happy.” Bethenny Frankel and Ramona Singer Bravo So where does Frankel and Singer’s friendship stand now? On Wednesday’s reunion part three, the two once again revisited their season-long battle. And after exchanging another round of blows, they appeared to settle back into a truce — even hugging at the end. “The thing was all season, I just wanted you to be out of my way,” Frankel told Singer. “I’m not angry at you — I knew you had such anxiety coming in here. I don’t feel anger towards you. But do I need to be your best friend? No.” “I don’t want to be close, but I don’t not not like you is where I am with you,” she said, quoting Singer’s iconic “I don’t not not like you” from earlier in the season. “I’m not angry with you, I honestly wish you happiness.” Her words resonated with Singer. “I feel it from you. I’m honestly happy we’re in this place. I really feel better,” she said, as host Andy Cohen pointed out the two weren’t in that good of a place. “At least [Bethenny’s] talking to me. She’s not icing me out. So for me, that’s good!” Bethenny Frankel and Ramona Singer Bravo Singer spent a lot of time Wednesday apologizing for her actions — even admitting that she “cringed” when she watched back some of her arguments with the upcoming Shark Tank investor. “It was blind range,” she said of her behavior in the Berkshires. “I was so angry, it was blind range.” She was also blind drunk too. “I had a few too many,” Singer admitted, balking down questions from Cohen that she was also on pills. “I wasn’t on pills, I was just drinking all day because being around her was making me nervous. I don’t take Xanax.” “Looking back, I looked like an a——. I don’t know what I was thinking the whole damn season,” Singer added. “I just lost my whole mojo for weeks on end because Bethenny was so upset with me — which I can understand in retrospect.

She believes they can figure things out and have a happy life together.”  Two hours after the story was published, Khloe tweeted: “I can’t believe some of the stories people create. Where do they come from and who are these “sources”? Hummmm.”  In fairness, Khloe may not have been referring to this story in particular. But she also may very well have been. You get me?  Khloe still hasn’t directly commented on the Tristan situation, but she certainly has been posting some super-cryptic quotes on her social media, which give us absolutely no insight into what the hell is going on. So that’s fun…  First she tweeted this last week: “You will never ever regret being kind to someone.”  Then when someone commented, “Unless they're ungrateful for it”, she replied, “Never give to get. Always try to give without expectations. Whether that be something tangible or emotional.”  Then yesterday she went on Instagram Stories to write: “Your mind will always believe everything you tell it. Feed it faith. Feed it truth. Feed it with love.”  And then: “Nobody cares about your story until you win. So win.”  Soooooooo, you marrying Tristan or not, Khloe?","You are a journalist.

Khloe Kardashian is officially not here to take anyone's shit, and we love her for it. Yesterday, People magazine published a story based on quotes from a ""source"" that said Khloe is happy with her decision to stay in Cleveland with baby True, and that she's keen to marry Tristan Thompson eventually, despite all that nasty cheating business. This comes as no surprise to fans of the reality TV star, who have watched her go through a rollercoaster of a relationship with the NBA player over the past few years.

Despite the fact that Tristan was caught red-handed cheating on Khloe multiple times, she has chosen to stand by him and work on their relationship. And why not? As she so eloquently put it, she's ""not here to take anyone's shit."" Khloe has always been unapologetically herself, and her decision to stay with Tristan is just another example of that.

The fact that she's considering marrying him despite everything that's happened is a testament to her strength and resilience. It's clear that Khloe is a woman who knows what she wants and isn't afraid to go after it, even if that means putting up with some pretty terrible behavior from her partner.

We can't wait to see what the future holds for Khloe and Tristan, but one thing is for sure: Khloe is not here to take anyone's shit, and we love her for it."

Did Mariah Carey, 47, have a vision of love when looking at boyfriend Bryan Tanaka, 34, one that left her feeling all sorts of emotions? After deciding that she just can’t let go of this hunk, Mariah reportedly decided to make it happen – an engagement, that is! “Word is Mariah took matters into her own hands,” a source tells OK! magazine, “It was an unusual proposal but it did the trick. She wrote a song about how she wanted Bryan to be her husband and she performed it for him while wearing a sexy, glitzy gown. Then she explained that she’s ready for them to make their relationship official.”  Bryan gave a “hearty yes,” as the insider says, “He couldn’t believe his luck!” It appears Bryan also thinks he and Mariah belong together, and he always wants to be her baby. These two aren’t waiting around for one sweet day to tie the knot. While love takes time, Mariah and Bryan are already busy making wedding plans. “Mariah would love to get married in May at the Grand Wailea Resort in Maui,” the insider told OK!, “where she and Bryan first went public with their romance.” Mariah and Bryan struck up a relationship in late 2016, with Mariah low-key confirming the romance in February 2017 by calling Bryan her “boyfriend.”  Mariah’s “also toying with the idea of a winter wonderland wedding,” the source says. “After all, she is the queen of Christmas!” Could Mariah have the fantasy holiday wedding she’s always wanted, saying “Thank God I found you” to her honey, her all? Whenever Mariah decides to get married, don’t forget about us when it comes to the wedding invitations!  This alleged engagement would be the third time Mariah walked down the aisle, as she was previously married to Tommy Mottola, 68, and Nick Cannon, 37. After dealing with a pair of heartbreakers, MiMi isn’t fooling around, especially when it comes to her $520 million fortune. She’s working on an ironclad prenup, according to OK! magazine. “She’s had tow failed marriages already,” the source says. “She’s not going to take any risks here.” Speaking of Nick, expect to see him during Mariah’s big day.  Nick and Mariah’s twins – son Morocco and daughter Monroe, 6 – will be featured in his wedding, and sources say Mariah’s thinking of asking Nick to walk her down the aisle. “[He] will always be a big part of her life,” the source added. Considering Mariah, Nick and the twins recently made an adorable appearance at the 2018 Kids’ Choice Awards, it makes total sense that Mariah’s ex would be on hand to see her say “I Do” again.","You are a journalist.

gossipcop-8581615474,1,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.

Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.

According to sources, Katie Holmes is having a difficult time navigating her personal life, with multiple reports of tension and conflict with her ex-husband Tom Cruise and her current boyfriend Jamie Foxx. The reports suggest that the actress is struggling to balance her relationships with her daughter Suri and her two high-profile partners, and is feeling overwhelmed and stressed as a result.

Insiders close to the situation have told various media outlets that Holmes is feeling particularly strained in her relationship with Cruise, who is reportedly pushing for more time with Suri and causing tension between Holmes and her daughter. Meanwhile, Foxx is said to be feeling frustrated by the situation and is growing increasingly distant from Holmes as a result.

The reports have sparked concern among fans of the actress, who are worried about the impact that the stress and tension may be having on Holmes and her relationships. As one source put it, “Katie is really struggling right now. She’s caught between two men and a daughter she loves, and it’s taking a toll on her.”

Despite the reports, Holmes has not publicly addressed the situation, and it remains to be seen how she will navigate the challenges ahead. However, given the complexity and sensitivity of the situation, it is clear that the actress is facing a difficult time and could use the support and understanding of her fans."
