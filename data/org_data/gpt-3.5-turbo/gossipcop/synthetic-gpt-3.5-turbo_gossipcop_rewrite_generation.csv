gossipcop-938421,"Let Zayn entertain you! The singer gets frisky with a stripper in his new video for ‘Entertainer!’ Watch here!  Zayn Mailk and model Sofia Jamora are at it again in his latest music video for “Entertainer.” In it, Sofia is seen rocking a blonde wig, which gives her more Kylie Jenner vibes than Gigi Hadid, but she’s in the dressing room of a strip club while Zayn walks the streets smoking a cig. The vid is a continuation of his last hit, “Let Me,” in which Zayn is essentially in Scarface and he and Sofia escape the bad guys on a boat. This time, Zayn enters the club and sees his love interest, while singing, “Guess you didn’t know that you were my favorite entertainer, I watch you, laugh with and f–k with you. Don’t you take me for a fool. In this game, I own the rules.” Damn.  As a bleach blonde Zayn spots Sofia, he has flashbacks to their “Let Me” rendezvous. Once Sofia starts dancing on him, he recalls their hotel hook up and we’re not gonna lie, it’s super hot. Sofia the stripper keeps looking up at a camera, recording she and Zayn in the club, and tell him she’ll BRB. Except Zayn flashes back again to Sofia leaving him in the hotel room and disappearing without a trace. She does it again, this time in the club, and leaves a hopeless Zayn alone once more. He sees her take off in a black car and watches her go.  The final scene shows Zayn standing alone on a dock with a suitcase, clearly ready for his next adventure. This time, there is no “To be continued…” We can’t help but wonder, was this a message to Gigi after she broke up with him? “Thought that you were smarter, I’m ashamed for you. I knew it right away when you stopped lovin’ me. It happened when your touch wasn’t enough for me,” the former One Directioner sings. Well, luckily, we know he got the girl again in reality, as he and Gigi have been spotted together since announcing their break-up. Fingers crossed!",0,en,0,"Let Zayn entertain you!

Dancing With the Stars will return for its 22nd season with Len Goodman back where he belongs, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champ, and a baby boy or girl for Allison Holker. There's much to look forward to, but not before we close out this season one last time with everything that happened after the finale! (In case you missed it, you can read our recap of the best and worst moments here .) Almost an hour after Tom Bergeron declared Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough the winners of season 21, Bindi was still in disbelief, shouting from the top of her lungs, ""I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!""

In case you needed further proof that the two are friends for life, consider this: Derek's hopping on a plane to Australia in a couple weeks ""to tackle crocodiles and get my official khakis!"" The Houghster may have nabbed his sixth Mirrorball trophy, but it was his partnership with Bindi that undoubtedly made it his favorite season. ""There's not a thing I would change about this season,"" he told Glamour post-show. ""There's not a week I would change, a dance I would change, and that was a very calming, very peaceful feeling.

While Bindi and Derek make the press rounds in New York City, it's no secret that she's itching to get back to her hometown down under. ""I can't wait to get back to all the animals, continue all the conservation work, and carry on in my dad's footsteps."" Season 21 runner-ups Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter were understandably disappointed not to win the big prize, but they both praised Bindi and Derek for their phenomenal journey this season.

One of the biggest stories backstage was the announcement that Len Goodman would be returning to the judges' table next season, and the news was heralded with much excitement from the pros. ""I can't wait,"" admitted Mark Ballas . ""I love Len. We missed him this season. It was definitely different, [so it will be] good to have him back in the driver's seat."" Allison Holker felt the same way: ""I think Len Goodman was the heart and soul of Dancing With the Stars and was such a great leader at the judges' table, along with Bruno, Carrie Ann, and Julianne."" Casting is currently underway for season 22. If Mark Ballas gets his wish, he'd love to have girlfriend BC Jean compete as a contestant.

""Yeah, and we'd probably win,"" she laughed of the possibility of being paired with Mark's best friend and honorary brother. Speaking of Derek, Mark told us backstage that getting to perform with BC (who he called ""the love of my life"") while Derek and Bindi danced was his favorite part of the evening. ""It was just amazing, cool, and unique. I've been on this show nearly 10 years in a row, and I've never experienced something like that.

Dancing With the Stars will be returning for its 22nd season with Len Goodman returning as a judge, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champion, and Allison Holker expecting a baby. Before we move on to the new season, let's take a moment to recap what happened after the finale. Almost an hour after Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough were declared the winners of season 21, Bindi expressed her disbelief and excitement by shouting, ""I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!"" Bindi's genuine nature and enthusiasm won over everyone on set, especially Derek. Derek told reporters backstage, ""It's just so special with Bindi. She's a champion of life."" Bindi echoed this sentiment, saying that she gained another brother in Derek. Their friendship is evident as Derek plans to visit Australia in a few weeks for crocodile adventures. This season was particularly special for Derek, as his partnership with Bindi made it his favorite. Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter, the season 21 runners-up, praised Bindi and Derek for their incredible journey. Sharna called Bindi the whole package and said she had a beautiful partnership with Derek. Nick expressed his enjoyment of being on the show and found each great moment to be a pleasant surprise. As for what's next, Nick has a solo album dropping and a movie coming out next year, all while preparing for fatherhood. Third-place contestant, Alek Skarlatos, will be going on the DWTS Tour this winter, but his immediate plan is to enjoy a satisfying meal. Allison Holker, who is six months pregnant, was full of energy backstage. She expressed her delight at dancing while pregnant and will find out the baby's gender on December 10. Allison is also preparing for her first Thanksgiving in charge of the turkey and is learning techniques from The Chew. One of the major announcements backstage was that Len Goodman will be returning as a judge next season. The pros, including Mark Ballas and Allison Holker, are thrilled to have him back. Casting is currently underway for season 22, and Mark hopes his girlfriend, BC Jean, will be a contestant. Mark joked that if she competed, they would probably be given to Derek as a pair. Mark's favorite moment of the evening was performing with BC while Derek and Bindi danced. It was a unique and amazing experience for him."

gossipcop-875793,"The visuals for Look What You Made Me Do offer a manic set of self-referential images that find the pop star commenting on the fall of her reputation Celebrities are often accused of lacking self-awareness. And no one’s been on the receiving end of that criticism more than Taylor Swift. Despite a lengthy catalogue of hits in which she plays scorned exes and lovelorn balladeers, the country singer turned pop superstar has been seen less as a victim than as a purveyor of victimhood, using her prodigious songwriting talents and natural affability to become a megaphone for perceived injustice. So what does Taylor Swift do to prove to us she’s aware of this narrative (the one, of course, from which she’d like to be excluded)? Acid gossip that borrows from better songs – Taylor Swift: Look What You Made Me Do review Read more Release a music video – for her new single, Look What You Made Me Do – that’s practically boiling over with meta-commentary and self-referential detail, from an ongoing visual snake motif to a tombstone that literally reads “Taylor Swift’s reputation”. Yes, it’s painfully on-the-nose, but Swift’s brand hasn’t exactly been built on subtlety. Look What You Made Me Do – or LWYMMD, as its Twitter hashtag dictates – is well on its way to smashing streaming records, but the song hasn’t been as well received by critics. Continuing in the tradition of her last album, 1989, which marked Swift’s official evolution into pop music behemoth, it largely abandons that which made her a household name – singable melodies; sharp, specific lyricism; grand tales of romantic enchantment – in favor of radio-engineered pop and glib proclamations of vengeance. Near the end of the song, she answers a phone call; someone’s asking to speak with Taylor Swift. “She can’t come to the phone right now,” Swift 2.0 says. Why? “Because she’s dead.” In the battle between Swifts, my allegiance is with the deceased version, a shrewd chronicler of young-adult courtship and seasoned, starry-eyed songwriter. So much so that hearing her new single made me nostalgic for the days of Fearless and Red. But the Old Swift be damned; this new one is all about retribution and, as the title of her forthcoming album suggests, reputation. The music video for LWYMMD, which premiered during Sunday night’s VMAs, sees Swift double down on her vengeful streak, making theatre of her scandal-laden career in an attempt to communicate a self-awareness that’s mostly eluded her. The video is good fun, if a little bit mad; it’s certainly the most brazen and ambitious pop music video since Beyoncé dropped Lemonade in the spring of last year, replete with pyrotechnics and dozens of costume changes. But it doesn’t amount to much more than a succession of disconnected images. And if the images could talk, they might say, “I know what you think of me”, or, perhaps, in the words of Joanne the Scammer: “I’m a messy bitch who lives for drama.” But still, in all those images, Swift left a lot to be decoded. A connoisseur of the tongue-in-cheek (remember the capitalized letters in her lyric booklets that spelled out clues about a song’s subject?), it begins with a zombified T-Swift digging her own grave. Get it? The Old Swift is dead, dunzo, kaput, resigned to the graveyard of pop culture history. First, we see the aforementioned tombstone, where Swift’s reputation lies, but also a second one, reading “Nils Sjoberg”, the pseudonym Swift used as a co-writer on her ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris’s song, This Is What You Came For, a collaboration widely assumed to have contributed to their breakup. Swift’s writing credit was supposed to be kept secret, but when her team revealed that she had, in fact, written the Harris-Rihanna hit, her ex went on a tweetstorm about how Swift was looking for “someone new to try and bury”. So she buried the fictitious Mr Sjoberg. In the next shot, Swift luxuriates in a tub of diamonds, where there sits a single dollar bill, a possible reference to the symboli",0,en,0,"The visuals for Look What You Made Me Do offer a manic set of self-referential images that find the pop star commenting on the fall of her reputation Celebrities are often accused of lacking self-awareness.

Continuing in the tradition of her last album, 1989, which marked Swift’s official evolution into pop music behemoth, it largely abandons that which made her a household name – singable melodies; sharp, specific lyricism; grand tales of romantic enchantment – in favor of radio-engineered pop and glib proclamations of vengeance. Near the end of the song, she answers a phone call; someone’s asking to speak with Taylor Swift. “She can’t come to the phone right now,” Swift 2.0 says. Why? “Because she’s dead.” In the battle between Swifts, my allegiance is with the deceased version, a shrewd chronicler of young-adult courtship and seasoned, starry-eyed songwriter. So much so that hearing her new single made me nostalgic for the days of Fearless and Red. But the Old Swift be damned; this new one is all about retribution and, as the title of her forthcoming album suggests, reputation. The music video for LWYMMD, which premiered during Sunday night’s VMAs, sees Swift double down on her vengeful streak, making theatre of her scandal-laden career in an attempt to communicate a self-awareness that’s mostly eluded her. The video is good fun, if a little bit mad; it’s certainly the most brazen and ambitious pop music video since Beyoncé dropped Lemonade in the spring of last year, replete with pyrotechnics and dozens of costume changes. But it doesn’t amount to much more than a succession of disconnected images. And if the images could talk, they might say, “I know what you think of me”, or, perhaps, in the words of Joanne the Scammer: “I’m a messy bitch who lives for drama.” But still, in all those images, Swift left a lot to be decoded. A connoisseur of the tongue-in-cheek (remember the capitalized letters in her lyric booklets that spelled out clues about a song’s subject?), it begins with a zombified T-Swift digging her own grave. Get it? The Old Swift is dead, dunzo, kaput, resigned to the graveyard of pop culture history. First, we see the aforementioned tombstone, where Swift’s reputation lies, but also a second one, reading “Nils Sjoberg”, the pseudonym Swift used as a co-writer on her ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris’s song, This Is What You Came For, a collaboration widely assumed to have contributed to their breakup. Swift’s writing credit was supposed to be kept secret, but when her team revealed that she had, in fact, written the Harris-Rihanna hit, her ex went on a tweetstorm about how Swift was looking for “someone new to try and bury”. So she buried the fictitious Mr Sjoberg. In the next shot, Swift luxuriates in a tub of diamonds, where there sits a single dollar bill, a possible reference to the symbolic dollar she earned in last month’s sexual assault case against the radio DJ who groped her in 2013. Internet conspiracists, too, ran with this as a visual reference to Melania Trump, who could be seen forking diamond necklaces like spaghetti in a Vanity Fair spread last year. But those were the same people insistent that Swift, who kept mum during last year’s presidential campaigns, is a closeted Trump supporter. That the election coincided with Swift’s period of self-imposed exile did little to get her back in the public’s good graces; but diamonds, unlike gilded toilet seats, do not a Trump reference make. This next one is a dead giveaway: Swift sits atop a throne as dozens of snakes slither at her feet. One even serves her what we can only assume is piping hot tea, the kind Kim Kardashian dished out when she released audio of Swift, who publicly disputed Kanye West’s lyric about her in Famous, appearing to sign off on those same lyrics in a phone conversation with West. Afterwards, Swift’s reputation as a snake in sheep’s clothing took off; Kardashian helped further that image by tweeting a bunch of snake emojis on international snake day. More than a year later, it seems Swift’s ready to embrace the title: ahead of the single’s release, she dropped cryptic reptilian teaser videos. And now, the snake has shed her skin. There’s also an inscription on Swift’s gold throne that reads “Et Tu Brute”, the Latin phrase used in William Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar when Caesar is being assassinated by his friend Brutus. It’s a far cry from the Swift of yesteryear, whose Shakespeare references were more Romeo and Juliet than Julius Caesar. But she’s dead, remember? It was at the 2016 Grammys, when 1989 beat Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly for album of the year, that Swift first began to truly test the public’s patience. That was also where she publicly rebuked West’s"

As a morning show host, Strahan has earned two Daytime Emmy Awards for “Outstanding Talk Show Host” for his work on “Live! With Kelly and Michael.”","Michael Strahan's net worth has been built through a combination of his successful football career and his endeavors as a talk-show host. Despite humble beginnings, Strahan's talent and dedication propelled him to great heights. Having grown up in Germany, it was not until his senior year of high school that he began playing competitive football after his parents sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in Texas. 

Strahan's skills on the field earned him a scholarship to Texas Southern University, where he excelled and set a record for sacks by his senior year. This accomplishment caught the attention of the NFL, leading to his draft by the New York Giants in 1993 as the 40th overall pick. Over the course of his 14-year career, Strahan cemented himself as the all-time quarterback sack leader in the league, earning multiple Pro Bowl appearances and a Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII.

Upon retiring from football in 2008, Strahan redirected his focus towards his off-field talents. In 2012, he joined Kelly Ripa as the co-host of ""Live! With Kelly"", replacing the long-standing host Regis Philbin. Four years later, Strahan made the move to ABC's ""Good Morning America"", leaving behind a void that would take over a year to fill with the announcement of Ryan Seacrest as the new co-host of ""Live"".

Strahan's impressive career also extends to his work as a Fox NFL Sunday analyst during the football season. His expertise and insights have made him a respected figure in the field. As of May 2017, Strahan's net worth was estimated to be around $65 million, accompanied by an annual salary of $17 million.

In addition to his television ventures, Strahan has kept himself busy with other projects. He currently serves as a full-time co-host on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" and hosts his own game show, ""The $100,000 Pyramid"". Strahan's entrepreneurial spirit led him to launch his own clothing line in 2015, which is available in JC Penney stores.

Throughout his football career, Strahan made a name for himself as a fierce defender, constantly sacking quarterbacks. He even set a record for most sacks in an NFL season in 2001. His excellence on the field earned him seven Pro Bowl appearances. Following his retirement, Strahan continued to garner accolades in his new role as a morning show host. He has received two Daytime Emmy Awards for ""Outstanding Talk Show Host"" for his work on ""Live! With Kelly and Michael""."

Part of the change in tone is down to the passage of time and to how much Britain, or perhaps the royal family, has changed in the last few years. Another reason, of course, is that Harry, being the second son and not a future king, has the freedom to be more relaxed, less constrained by tradition, and less conventional than his brother. This wedding has nothing to do with dynasty, or ensuring the security of the royal line. (We hope they have kids! But only because it’s fun to have kids, not because it would be some sort of international crisis if they did not.) This wedding had everything to do with two people who are totally into each other and wanted to have a great big happy celebration. Oprah, Beckhams and Clooneys, oh my! Photo One of the great excitements about any wedding, of course, is the moment you learn who has been invited and who has not. Meghan and Harry’s list was kept secret, until the very moment that dozens of mysterious figures started to enter St. George’s Chapel. It was very exciting. There was none other than Oprah Winfrey, in a snug pink dress, a pair of very cool sunglasses and a massive broad-brimmed hat spectacularly festooned with flowers. If anyone qualifies as American royalty, it is surely Oprah, with her ability to transcend race and background, and her great gift for openness and emotional candor.

They have always done such a good job of wearing appropriate outfits, smiling tastefully and saying nothing.

It turned into Celebrity Central. George and Amal Clooney made their stately, Hollywood-y entrance (She was in yellow with an interesting train). David and Victoria Beckham, a.k.a. Posh and Becks, came in and graced some people in the crowd with their conversation.","The atmosphere was filled with happiness and tranquility as both of them exchanged their vows. Their radiant smiles and relaxed demeanor captivated everyone present, and fortunately, no objections were raised to their union. This pivotal moment in the ceremony never fails to stir excitement among the attendees. The event itself was an extraordinary amalgamation of tradition and modernity, seamlessly blending centuries of history with contemporary touches. The presence of prominent figures such as Oprah and Meghan's mother, an African-American social worker, added to the charm and appropriateness of the occasion. The entire royal family, along with esteemed English aristocrats and dignitaries, graced the celebration. The music resonated with dignity and beauty, while the venue itself inspired awe. Notably, a diverse assembly of clergymen, including the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Most Rev. Michael Curry, head of the Episcopal Church, were in attendance. Bishop Curry, an African-American, delivered a passionate address quoting Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., emphasizing the significance of love in religion and life. Following his speech, Lady Jane Fellowes, Harry's aunt, conveyed both joy and a sense that the lingering sorrow from his mother's passing had finally lifted. Her recitation, a passage from the Song of Solomon, moved everyone: ""Arise my love, my fair one, and come away; for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.""

The wedding dress itself was a resounding success, evoking a sense of simplicity and elegance. Designed by Clare Waight Keller, the first female designer of Givenchy, it represented Meghan Markle's independence and highlighted female strength. The choice to showcase a local designer and establish connections with Europe further added to its significance. The five-meter veil, adorned with hand-embroidered flowers, symbolized the flora of all 53 Commonwealth nations. Interestingly, Clare Waight Keller's name had never been mentioned in the midst of circulating rumors about the dress, making it a delightful surprise that surpassed expectations.

Unlike previous royal weddings, which exuded a solemn and formal atmosphere, this celebration radiated a sense of joy and camaraderie. The guests mingled with one another, exchanging air-kisses and engaging in lively conversations. It felt like a grand royal and celebrity gathering, akin to the excitement of the Academy Awards. The change in tone can be attributed to the passing of time and the evolving nature of the royal family and Britain itself. Prince Harry, as the second son and not in line for the throne, enjoyed the freedom to be more relaxed and non-traditional compared to his brother. This wedding was not about securing the royal line or maintaining dynasty. It was a testament to the love and happiness between two individuals who wished to celebrate their union in grand fashion.

The guest list for the wedding was a topic of great intrigue, and as the mysterious figures entered St. George's Chapel, excitement filled the air. The presence of iconic figures such as Oprah Winfrey, with her remarkable ability to transcend boundaries and connect with people from all walks of life, added to the event's grandeur. Kate Middleton's parents, Carole and Michael, carried themselves with grace and elegance, as they have always done. Charles Spencer, Diana's brother, known for his eventful personal life and passionate defense of his sister against the British media, was also in attendance. The wedding became a haven for celebrities, with stars like George and Amal Clooney and David and Victoria Beckham captivating the crowd with their presence and engaging in conversations with admirers."

gossipcop-887194,"Photo by Steve Granitz via Getty Images  This Week in 2007 is a weekly column looking back on Lindsay Lohan, the first iPhone, George W. Bush, and everything else we loved about the year 2007.  Today, it's easy to forget how much America detested Spencer and Heidi, a.k.a. Speidi. Heidi is a soon-to-be mom who posts videos of her dogs, and Spencer is best known as a reality TV scholar who dishes to the New York Times about pop culture in the era of President Donald Trump. But Speidi earned their reality TV status ten years ago this week when they launched a public feud against their Hills co-star Laura Conrad.  Their fight was anything but scholarly. Heidi and Lauren were once the Laverne and Shirley of MTV. They roomed together in West Hollywood, and fans expected the series to end with them serving as each other's bridesmaids. That is until Heidi started dating Spencer in season two. Lauren advised her to ditch him, but she refused. On the season finale, Heidi moved in with Spencer. Her friendship with Lauren was done.  On August 5, 2007, roughly a week before the season three premiere, Perez Hilton reported rumors that Lauren had filmed a sex tape with her ex, Laguna Beach cast member Jason Wahler. Lauren denied the claims to US Weekly, according to Gawker, saying, ""Honestly, they videotape my life five days out of the week. I don't need additional footage, you know?""  Lauren pointed the finger at her ex-roommate and her villainous boyfriend. As Tyra Banks later explained on her talk show while holding paper dolls of Spencer and Heidi: ""Spencer and Heidi have started a rumor about [Lauren]. It's a rumor about something really bad. Spencer and Heidi say that [Lauren has] a sex tape out there."" The accusation carried such dramatic intensity because fans had watched Lauren and Heidi's friendship strengthen over the course of the preceding seasons.  ""[Lauren's] the douche, the psycho,"" Spencer responded on Philadelphia's Q102 FM during his press tour for season three. Heidi likewise denied Lauren's claims.    Read more: The Undying Love of Spencer and Heidi Pratt  On August 6, he went even further, launching SpencerPratt.com and attacking his enemy on the new platform. ""For all you Haters- Please feel free to Hate on me here on my blog/board were I actually read comments! … But if you hate me because you think I ruined Lauren and Heidi friendship…you have your facts all wrong!"" he wrote in his inauguratory post. ""Lauren ruined Heidi and Laurens friendship when she told Heidi that she could not be friends with her as long as she dated me … when those cameras turn off LC(BEEF CURTAINS) is a completely different person…she goes back to being the spoiled brat that made her famous on Laguna Beach.""  According to US Weekly, MTV ""suspended"" Spencer and Heidi's press appearances in response to the pair's ""trash-talking."" The news only boosted awareness of Speidi's war against Lauren. ""It's her party and she'll ban Spencer and Heidi if she wants to!"" TMZ blurbed on August 10. Lauren had allegedly booted Heidi and Spencer from MTV's premiere party, and US reported that MTV ordered Spencer and Heidi to walk the red carpet early and leave once Lauren arrived.

She wants to know why Laur",0,en,0,"Photo by Steve Granitz via Getty Images  This Week in 2007 is a weekly column looking back on Lindsay Lohan, the first iPhone, George W. Bush, and everything else we loved about the year 2007.  Today, it's easy to forget how much America detested Spencer and Heidi, a.k.a. Speidi. Heidi is a soon-to-be mom who posts videos of her dogs, and Spencer is best known as a reality TV scholar who dishes to the New York Times about pop culture in the era of President Donald Trump. But Speidi earned their reality TV status ten years ago this week when they launched a public feud against their Hills co-star Laura Conrad.  Their fight was anything but scholarly. Heidi and Lauren were once the Laverne and Shirley of MTV. They roomed together in West Hollywood, and fans expected the series to end with them serving as each other's bridesmaids. That is until Heidi started dating Spencer in season two. Lauren advised her to ditch him, but she refused. On the season finale, Heidi moved in with Spencer. Her friendship with Lauren was done.  On August 5, 2007, roughly a week before the season three premiere, Perez Hilton reported rumors that Lauren had filmed a sex tape with her ex, Laguna Beach cast member Jason Wahler. Lauren denied the claims to US Weekly, according to Gawker, saying, ""Honestly, they videotape my life five days out of the week. I don't need additional footage, you know?""  Lauren pointed the finger at her ex-roommate and her villainous boyfriend. As Tyra Banks later explained on her talk show while holding paper dolls of Spencer and Heidi: ""Spencer and Heidi have started a rumor about [Lauren]. It's a rumor about something really bad. Spencer and Heidi say that [Lauren has] a sex tape out there."" The accusation carried such dramatic intensity because fans had watched Lauren and Heidi's friendship strengthen over the course of the preceding seasons.  ""[Lauren's] the douche, the psycho,"" Spencer responded on Philadelphia's Q102 FM during his press tour for season three. Heidi likewise denied Lauren's claims.    Read more: The Undying Love of Spencer and Heidi Pratt  On August 6, he went even further, launching SpencerPratt.com and attacking his enemy on the new platform. ""For all you Haters- Please feel free to Hate on me here on my blog/board were I actually read comments! … But if you hate me because you think I ruined Lauren and Heidi friendship…you have your facts all wrong!"" he wrote in his inauguratory post. ""Lauren ruined Heidi and Laurens friendship when she told Heidi that she could not be friends with her as long as she dated me … when those cameras turn off LC(BEEF CURTAINS) is a completely different person…she goes back to being the spoiled brat that made her famous on Laguna Beach.""  According to US Weekly, MTV ""suspended"" Spencer and Heidi's press appearances in response to the pair's ""trash-talking."" The news only boosted awareness of Speidi's war against Lauren. ""It's her party and she'll ban Spencer and Heidi if she wants to!"" TMZ blurbed on August 10. Lauren had allegedly booted Heidi and Spencer from MTV's premiere party, and US reported that MTV ordered Spencer and Heidi to walk the red carpet early and leave once Lauren arrived.  Looking back, Spencer believes the reality was even worse than the news reports. ""Actually, [Lauren] told MTV if they didn't stop filming with me she would quit and they told her then quit,"" he tells Broadly in a direct message.

gossipcop-955735,"Tom Cruise truly is as great as he seems. The cast of Mission: Impossible-Fallout learned firsthand just how impressive the star was throughout the course of their filming. From stopping mid-take to ask extras if they were okay, to expertly maneuvering a helicopter in the mountains, Cruise won over the hearts of the star studded group, including Henry Cavill. “I am not easily impressed, and I know some people who have done genuinely seriously impressive stuff, and watching Tom do these stunts, especially in the mountains in that helicopter. I just thought, ‘Okay I am officially impressed,'” the Superman actor shared. He added, “This is ridiculous what he is doing. And he learns all these skills for these movies and does them to an elite level. It is remarkable, truly remarkable.” Aside from being an amazing stuntman, the actors added that he is genuinely a good person, with Angela Bassett saying, “He truly is just incredibly warm, generous, embracing.

People are always so all over on him, so I think he likes to redistribute it,” the Brit joked. The general consensus though is that the Top Gun star is a just a normal guy, despite all the mystery that surrounds him. “He allows himself to be surrounded by a lot of mystique and conjecture and gossip and he just sort of lets it fester and I think that makes people think he is some sort of inhuman kind of thing, but he is just a bloke,” Pegg explained.

Fallout could easily have felt like more of the same, were it not for, among other things, Cruise’s fierce commitment to doing whatever he has to do to entertain people. Here, that means “nearly killing himself.” Not every one of this film’s 147 minutes is dedicated to action sequences that seem to catalogue the ways in which Tom Cruise could have died on set — the pre-title sequence is both ominous and deliciously twisty without featuring any severe action. But once Ethan and his not-entirely-willing new partner, CIA agent August Walker (a mustachioed Henry Cavill), have to do a HALO jump from above 20,000 feet in the air into a Parisian nightclub, Fallout isn’t playing around. Yes, Cruise pulled off that jump, just like he climbed up a rope to take over a helicopter mid-flight and jumped from one London building to another. (Of course, as you may know, he broke his ankle in the process, in a shot that’s in the finished film.) It’s difficult to know exactly what makes the Mission: Impossible franchise so special for Cruise, what makes it work so well for his intense persona. Movies like Jack Reacher: Never Go Back and The Mummy suggest that Cruise is looking for other franchises on which to work in between making M:I adventures. (Seeing that Cruise is co-starring in a Top Gun sequel next only furthers this notion.) But few of those capture the ineffable essence of Cruise the way that Ethan Hunt does. In Fallout, Hunt is at his most desperate. One of Ethan’s refrains in Fallout feels like a Cruise mission statement: “I’ll figure it out!” The tension in that statement is always in wondering how. Ethan, of course, does figure things out at the last second, but how he does is always thrilling. The same can’t be said for those other would-be franchises.

Maybe that’s just Wilmer. But I do believe that Latin people are just more expressive, more passionate with their emotions. He’s very manly, and he can be stubborn like Latino men can, but he’s protective and he cares so much and loves so hard.

By the way, love is fluid.” The singer added “Whether there’s been rumours with one specific person or not, that’s all that matters. Humans are humans, and when you connect with somebody on a spiritual level it doesn’t matter. I don’t want people to ever look at the past or rumours or anything and try to figure me out.” 4. She Won the GLAAD Vanguard Award for Promoting LGBTQ Equality While Lovato may be keeping her personal life under wraps, she has made no effort to hide her support for the LGBTQ community. The singer has been so supportive, in fact, that she was given the GLAAD Vanguard Award in 2016, which, according to the GLAAD website, is “presented to media professionals who have made a significant difference in promoting equality and acceptance.” The award was given to her by close friend and former Camp Rock co-star Nick Jonas. “Demi Lovato has consistently used her platform as a successful artist to send messages of acceptance and support to LGBT people everywhere,” said GLAAD President & CEO Sarah Kate Ellis. “She is an extraordinary ally who is committed to helping young people embrace who they are and live the lives they love.” During her acceptance speech, Lovato said “You should always love yourself for who you are,” she said. “The skin that you are in, whether you identify with it and are afraid to tell people, just go for it. You can do it!” Watch the full speech above. 5. She Said She’s Not ‘Denying’ or ‘Confirming’ Her Sexuality Lovato’s 2015 single “Cool for the Summer” had many fans wondering whether or not this was her coy way of speaking on her sexuality. The lyrics “Tell me what you want, what you like, it’s ok / I’m a little curious, too” and “Got a taste for the cherry / I just need","Demi Lovato's recent interaction with Lauren Abedini, also known as DJ Kittens, has led to speculation about a potential romance between the two. According to Page Six, the pair were seen at Disneyland holding hands, causing fans and media outlets to question if they are dating. Lovato, who has never officially confirmed her sexuality, hinted at being bisexual in her song lyrics. Here are some key points to consider regarding Demi Lovato's sexuality:

1. Fan Support for Rumors Involving Lauren Abedini
Although there is no official confirmation from either Lovato or Abedini's representatives about their relationship status, fans on social media have been expressing their support. Fan accounts, such as Demipedia, highlighted Abedini's accomplishments and feminist beliefs alongside the rumored romance. Others humorously tweeted their disappointment at not being Lovato's girlfriend.

2. Previous Relationships With Male Celebrities
Like many other celebrities, Lovato has had relationships with people within the industry. She dated Alex DeLeon, the frontman of The Cab, and even based a song on their breakup. Lovato also had brief flings with Trace Cyrus, Miley's brother, and Joe Jonas, whom she referred to as her ""BFF."" However, her most notable relationship to date has been with Wilmer Valderrama, whom she dated from 2010 to 2016. Lovato openly discussed what attracted her to Valderrama in an interview with Latina magazine, emphasizing his passion and protectiveness.

Since her breakup with Valderrama, Lovato has been seen with MMA fighter Guilherme ""Bomba"" Vasconcelos and Abedini.

3. Rumors of a Past Hookup with Ruby Rose in 2013
In 2013, Ruby Rose, a model and actress, claimed on Twitter that she had a relationship with Lovato. However, Lovato denied these rumors in a 2015 interview with Complex magazine, asserting that rumors are just rumors and that she was not in a relationship with Rose. She highlighted the fluidity of love and the importance of connecting with someone on a spiritual level.

4. Recognition for LGBTQ Support
While Lovato has not explicitly revealed her sexuality, she has been a strong supporter of the LGBTQ community. In 2016, she was honored with the GLAAD Vanguard Award, which recognizes media professionals who promote equality and acceptance. She received the award from her close friend and former co-star, Nick Jonas. During her acceptance speech, Lovato encouraged self-acceptance and emphasized the need to embrace one's authentic self.

5. Lovato's Ambiguous Approach to Her Sexuality
The release of Lovato's single ""Cool for the Summer"" in 2015 led to speculation about her sexuality. While the lyrics hint at curiosity and experimentation, Lovato has neither confirmed nor denied her true sexuality. In interviews, she has encouraged others to embrace their identities and not to get caught up in rumors or past relationships.

In conclusion, Demi Lovato's sexuality remains unconfirmed, but her support for the LGBTQ community and her fans' continued speculation demonstrate the importance of inclusivity and acceptance in her life and career."

So I feel so connected to this country, and I was really honored and wanted to do great things for the country, and work in an even deeper way.""  Of course, Jolie says all of her kids -- including Pax, Shiloh, Zahara and twins Vivienne and Knox -- are respectful of other countries.  ""Funnily enough, Shiloh speaks the most [Khmer], my middle girl, born in Namibia,"" she shares. ""My kids are from different countries, but there's an understanding, you don't have to like a country just because you were born in it. You need to respect all countries. And be very open to each other's, of course.""  ""Mad is very proud to be Cambodian; he loves languages,"" she continues. ""He's actually focused on German, Russian, Korean and French -- he's a linguist. He speaks a little Khmer, but I'm not forcing it. It's very important that he does as much as he wanted to do and that he loves it naturally. He was the one who said he wanted us to make the film. We'd had the script for a few years. We said, 'When you're ready -- because you're going to have to work with us -- go deep, research, be there.'""  Why Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie Have Slowed Down Their Divorce Process -- And No, They're Not Getting Back Together  Jolie has been increasingly candid about her split from Pitt, recently telling the Sunday Telegraph that she doesn't enjoy being single.

It's been so bad that the Kardashian-West clan have just decided to end 2016 early. Yes, Kim and Kanye have decided to cancel all public and professional commitments for the end of the year and plan to maintain their social media blackouts as well.

Is it possible for President Obama's last major act to be an executive decree for us to just all get a chance to chill out and recuperate for the remaining 26 days left in this bummer of a year? Sure, there's no political safeguarding against any potential additional music legends from dying or preventing any further tragedies and disasters from happening or ensuring that some new odd Zika-like disease pops up, but there's got to be something? How about the ""Netflix and Chill Act?"" Just an order that all Americans get to spend the next month relaxing and catching up on any television series they may have missed this year.  Of course, when it comes to Kim and Kanye it's understandable that they've decided to literally cancel the rest of their 2016.

He was spotted with newly blond hair at designer Rick Owens' furniture show in Los Angeles .","As the end of the year approaches, it has become customary for people to express their dissatisfaction with the previous months, claiming them to be the worst ever. However, this year, that sentiment feels particularly strong. The headlines have been dominated by a barrage of bizarre and disheartening news, creating a sense of living in a dystopian nightmare. This sentiment is so pervasive that even the Kardashian-West family has chosen to end their year prematurely. Kim and Kanye have decided to cancel all their public and professional commitments, as well as maintain a blackout on their social media presence. A representative of the couple has confirmed to Page Six that they intend to take the rest of the year off and prioritize family time.

In reality, many of us wish we could do the same. Is it possible for President Obama's final act to be an executive decree granting us all an opportunity to relax and recuperate for the remaining 26 days of this challenging year? While such a decree cannot prevent potential tragedies or disasters, or even the loss of music legends, it could offer a respite. Perhaps we could enact a ""Netflix and Chill Act,"" allowing all Americans to take the following month to unwind and catch up on missed television series.

Considering Kim and Kanye's recent struggles, it is understandable why they have decided to cancel the remainder of their 2016 commitments. Kim has been recovering from a traumatic robbery incident in Paris, while Kanye experienced a highly publicized breakdown that led to his hospitalization. These personal tragedies have unfolded under an intense public spotlight, with numerous rumors circulating in the tabloid press. According to E!, a source close to the family reports that Kim is coping well despite the media speculation. The source affirms her commitment to supporting Kanye and helping him recover. Kanye was discharged from the hospital last week after receiving treatment for exhaustion. Kim remains by his side, ensuring he continues to receive the necessary therapy and care.

Regardless of personal opinions about the couple, it is evident that they deserve a period of rest. In addition to their personal challenges, they are also responsible for caring for their two young children, one of whom is celebrating their first birthday today. It would be wise for us to respect their need for solitude and relaxation over the next month. Unfortunately, most of us do not have the luxury to do the same, despite our yearning for respite. Furthermore, it seems that 2017 may not bring much relief either. Nonetheless, we can only hope that a well-rested and healthier Kim and Kanye will be able to provide the distractions we so desperately need in the coming year. As an update, Kanye has recently made a low-key appearance in public, sporting newly blond hair at a furniture show in Los Angeles hosted by designer Rick Owens."

The groom, Prince Harry, is a member of the British royal family; the bride, Meghan Markle, is an American and former actress.[note 1] On the morning of the wedding, Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, conferred upon him the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. On her marriage, Markle became Duchess of Sussex.[1] The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, officiated at the wedding using the standard Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony published in Common Worship, the liturgical text of the Church of England.[2][3] Announcement of engagement [ edit ] Prince Harry is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. He and Meghan Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the Canadian-American legal-drama television series Suits, have been in a relationship since 2016, having first met in July 2016.[4] The relationship was officially acknowledged on 8 November 2016, when a statement was released from the royal family's communications secretary addressing the ""wave of abuse and harassment"" directed toward Markle.[5] Harry and Meghan attending church on Christmas Day, 2017 On 27 November 2017, Clarence House announced that Prince Harry would marry Markle in the spring of 2018.[6] They were engaged earlier the same month in London, with the Prince giving Markle a bespoke engagement ring made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, consisting of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection.[7] At the same time, it was announced that they would live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace following their marriage.[8] The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh expressed their delight at the news, while congratulations came in from various political leaders, including the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[8] During the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace's Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[9][10] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[7][11] Markle is the second American[note 2] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[12] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[13][14][15][16][17] Under the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign's consent in order to marry. Harry was fifth in line at the time of his engagement.[18] The Queen's consent was declared to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 14 March 2018.[19][20] Although Markle attended a private Catholic school in her early years, she is not Roman Catholic.[21] On 6 March 2018, she was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at St. James's Palace.[22] Although Markle was divorced, the Anglican Church has permitted marriage to divorced persons with a living spouse since 2002.[23][24] After the engagement, Markle began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[25] She will retain her U.S. citizenship during the process,[26] but Kensington Palace have indicated that the decision on whether she will retain dual nationality has not yet been made.[25] Retaining U.S. citizenship is expected to create tax complications.[27] The couple was invited to celebrate Christmas 2017 with th",1,en,"The wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was held on 19 May 2018 in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in the United Kingdom.

After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[8] During the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace's Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[9][10] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[7][11] Markle is the second American[note 2] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[12] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[13][14][15][16][17] Under the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign's consent in order to marry. Harry was fifth in line at the time of his engagement.[18] The Queen's consent was declared to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 14 March 2018.[19][20] Although Markle attended a private Catholic school in her early years, she is not Roman Catholic.[21] On 6 March 2018, she was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at St. James's Palace.[22] Although Markle was divorced, the Anglican Church has permitted marriage to divorced persons with a living spouse since 2002.[23][24] After the engagement, Markle began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[25] She will retain her U.S. citizenship during the process,[26] but Kensington Palace have indicated that the decision on whether she will retain dual nationality has not yet been made.[25] Retaining U.S. citizenship is expected to create tax complications.[27] The couple was invited to celebrate Christmas 2017 with the royal family at the Queen's Sandringham estate.[28] The official engagement photographs were taken by Alexi Lubomirski (a former assistant to Mario Testino) at Frogmore House, and were issued by Kensington Palace on 21 December 2017.[29] To mark the wedding of Harry and Meghan, the Royal Mint produced an official UK £5 coin, showing the couple in profile.[30] In May, a set of commemorative postage stamps, featuring the couple's official engagement photographs, was issued by Royal Mail.[31] Wedding [ edit ] Planning [ edit ] Preparation for wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Unlike the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the wedding day of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was not declared a bank holiday.[32] The wedding was on the same date as the FA Cup Final, which Prince Harry's brother William normally attends in his role as President of the Football Association.[33] Holding the royal wedding on a weekend is a break with the royal tradition of having weddings on a weekday.[34] On 12 February 2018, Kensington Palace announced that the ceremony would commence at 12:00 Midday BST. Venue [ edit ] The wedding took place on Saturday, 19 May 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor.[35] The chapel had previously been the venue for the weddings of Prince Harry's uncle, the Earl of Wessex, as well as that of his cousin, Peter Phillips, and for the blessing of the marriage of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, Harry's stepmother.[36] Cost [ edit ] The royal family announced that they would pay for the wedding.[37] The costs for the cake, the florist, and the catering have been estimated to be £50,000, £110,000, and £286,000 respectively,[38] and the overall cost is expected to be around £32 million.[39] The security costs are expected to be lower than those of the 2011 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.[40] The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead has reportedly spent £2.6 million on cleaning the town and roads.[40] It has been predicted that the wedding will trigger a tourism boom and boost the economy by up to £500 million.[41] Wedding attire [ edit ] The wedding invitations specified a dress code for men of ""Dress Uniform, Morning Coat","The wedding ceremony of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was solemnized on the 19th of May 2018, taking place in the tranquil surroundings of St George's Chapel, located within the timeless walls of Windsor Castle in the United Kingdom. The distinguished groom, Prince Harry, belongs to the esteemed British royal family, while the bride, Meghan Markle, hails from the United States and brings with her a background in acting. On the auspicious morning of their nuptials, Prince Harry's beloved grandmother, none other than Queen Elizabeth II, bestowed upon him the esteemed titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton, and Baron Kilkeel. In a gesture of marital union, Meghan Markle, upon her wedding, became the Duchess of Sussex. The esteemed Archbishop of Canterbury, the honorable Justin Welby, officiated the matrimonial proceedings, employing the customary Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony, as prescribed in the revered liturgical text of the Church of England, aptly named Common Worship.

The announcement of their engagement, which had long been a topic of intense public speculation, came after Prince Harry, the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales, had been courting Meghan Markle, a talented American actress, since 2016. Their paths first intertwined in the month of July in that same year. The existence of their relationship was officially acknowledged on the 8th of November 2016 when a statement from the royal family's communications secretary was released, addressing the distressing ""wave of abuse and harassment"" that had been directed towards Markle. It was on the 27th of November 2017 when Clarence House made the joyous proclamation that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle would embark on the journey of matrimony in the spring of 2018. Their engagement, which had transpired earlier that same month in the city of London, witnessed the Prince offering his beloved a bespoke engagement ring, crafted by the revered Cleave and Company, who proudly hold the august position of court jewellers and medalists to the Queen. The exquisite ring showcased a magnificent central diamond sourced from Botswana, encircled by two smaller diamonds from his mother's cherished collection of jewelry. Simultaneously, it was revealed that upon their nuptials, the couple would reside in Nottingham Cottage, nestled within the splendid grounds of Kensington Palace. The Queen, accompanied by her esteemed consort, the Duke of Edinburgh, expressed profound delight at this momentous news, while felicitations poured in from around the globe, encompassing various political leaders, including the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. Responding to this tidal wave of congratulations, the couple partook in an exclusive interview with the esteemed Mishal Husain of BBC News.

During the notable public announcement of their engagement, held amidst the enchanting surroundings of Sunken Gardens within Kensington Palace, Meghan Markle was resplendent in a breathtaking bottle knee-length emerald green dress, featuring artful bow detailing at the cinched waist, which was artfully crafted by the renowned Italian fashion house, P.A.R.O.S.H. She complemented this elegant ensemble with a magnificent white trench coat, created by the esteemed Canadian brand, Line the Label. Such was the fervor surrounding this momentous declaration that within hours of its release, the website of Line the Label succumbed to the unprecedented influx of individuals eager to procure the coveted coat for themselves. The marriage between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle holds special significance as it marks the union of the second-ever American individual, as well as the first individual of mixed race heritage, with the eminent British royal family. The news of their engagement sparked widespread commentary on the potential societal implications of Markle proudly and prominently taking on the role of a mixed-race royal. It is notable to mention that as per the provisions of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the consent of the Sovereign is required for the first six individuals in line to the throne in order to enter into matrimony. At the time of their engagement, Prince Harry ranked fifth in the line of succession. On the 14th of March 2018, the Queen's consent was officially proclaimed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. Notwithstanding the fact that Meghan Markle had attended a private Catholic school during her formative years, it is important to highlight that she does not follow the Roman Catholic faith. In March 2018, she undertook the profound step of being baptized and confirmed into the Church of England within the historic confines of St. James's Palace, with the revered Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, bestowing upon her this sacred sacrament. It is also pertinent to mention that despite Markle having been previously married, the Anglican Church has, since 2002, embraced the notion of marriage to individuals who have experienced divorce, while their former spouse remains living. Following their engagement, Meghan Markle embarked on an intricate and lengthy process to obtain British citizenship, a journey she will undertake while retaining her U.S. citizenship. However, it must be stated that Kensington Palace has yet to announce whether she will maintain dual nationality. Retaining U.S. citizenship during this transition is anticipated to give rise to certain complexities in matters of taxation. Displaying their commitment to unity and familial harmony, the couple was honored with an invitation to join the royal family in celebrating the joyous occasion of Christmas in 2017 at the illustrious Sandringham estate of Her Majesty, the Queen. The esteemed Alexi Lubomirski, a former protege of Mario Testino, captured their love and radiance in the enchanting official engagement photographs, which were taken within the splendid confines of Frogmore House, and subsequently released by Kensington Palace on the 21st of December 2017. In commemoration of the momentous wedding between Prince Harry and Meghan, the Royal Mint of the United Kingdom produced a dedicated and officially sanctioned £5 coin, which strikingly depicts the blissful couple in profile. Additionally, Royal Mail introduced a set of commemorative postage stamps featuring the official engagement photographs of the couple, further enshrining their union within the beloved and cherished traditions of the British postal system.

Moving on to the eminent day of their wedding, it is noteworthy to mention that unlike the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the eagerly anticipated nuptials of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were not declared a public holiday. The chosen date, the 19th of May 2018, coincided with the hallowed day of the FA Cup Final, an event traditionally attended by Prince Harry's brother, Prince William, in his capacity as the President of the esteemed Football Association. The decision to hold the wedding on a weekend departed from the customary royal tradition of conducting these momentous ceremonies on a weekday. On the 12th of February 2018, Kensington Palace, with great anticipation, revealed that the wedding ceremony would commence at precisely 12:00 noon, British Summer Time.

Moving on to the significant matter of the wedding venue, the momentous occasion unfolded within the revered and sacred walls of St George's Chapel, situated within the serene confines of Windsor. This exquisite chapel had previously played host to the wedding ceremonies of Prince Harry's uncle, the Earl of Wessex, as well as his cousin, Peter Phillips. Additionally, it served as the sacred setting for the celebratory blessing of the marriage between the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, who holds the cherished distinction of being Prince Harry's remarkable stepmother.

Addressing the matter of expenses, it has been officially announced that the esteemed royal family shall bear the financial burden of the wedding ceremony. While the intricate wedding cake, the delightful floral arrangements, and the sumptuous catering services have been estimated to cost £50,000, £110,000, and £286,000 respectively, the overall expenditure is anticipated to amount to approximately £32 million. Notably, the security costs for this auspicious occasion are expected to be lower in comparison to the momentous wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011. On a local level, the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead has reportedly allocated an estimated £2.6 million to ensure the pristine cleanliness and flawless appearance of the town and its surrounding thoroughfares. Predictions abound that the wedding shall trigger a much-anticipated upsurge in tourism, subsequently bolstering the economic prospects of the entire region, surpassing an impressive £500 million.

Of particular significance is the matter of wedding attire. The meticulously designed wedding invitations explicitly set forth a dress code for gentlemen, which required the donning of ""Dress Uniform, Morning Coat..."""

gossipcop-6803836615,"What do Katy Perry, Meryl Streep, Anderson Cooper and Chelsea Clinton have in common? They have all eaten human flesh at LA’s notorious cannibal restaurant, Cannibal Club.  The private restaurant has long operated under the radar in Los Angeles, with rumors circulating about who has attended and what is really served behind closed doors. Now a leaked Cannibal Club document has exposed some of the notorious restaurant’s “elite” patrons.  CANNIBALISM ‘MORE POPULAR THAN YOU MIGHT THINK’  Meryl Streep, Chelsea Clinton and CNN’s Anderson Cooper all hold Cannibal Club membership, according to the document. Katy Perry, who has previously said that “Cannibalism is way more popular than you might think” and “human flesh is the best meat“, is also a regular diner.  Boasting that the restaurant is the “cutting edge of experimental cuisine” and serves “L.A.’s cultural elite“, the Cannibal Club website makes clear they “specialize in the preparation of human meat” that comes from “young and healthy bodies.“  Cannibal Club’s visiting chefs “hail from around the world” and come to L.A. to “practice their craft free of compromise and unbounded by convention,” according to the Cannibal Club website.  ‘FILMMAKERS, INTELLECTUALS, AND CELEBRITIES’  “Our exclusive clientele includes noted filmmakers, intellectuals, and celebrities who have embraced the Enlightenment ideals of free expression and rationalism. On event nights, avant-garde performance artists, celebrated literary figures, and ground-breaking musicians entertain our guests.  “At Cannibal Club, we celebrate artistic excellence as the natural and inevitable expression of the unbridled human spirit.“  Describing each dish as a “study in taste and elegance“, Chef de Cuisine Sophie Laffite explains: “The meat we serve is selected from the young and healthy. Consistent with the practice of cannibalism in many primitive societies, we view anthropophagy as homage to the dead, who are reborn into the bodies of their consumers.”  But don’t think you can just walk in there and check the place out. The private restaurant operates a strict vetting policy, according to the website:  “It is necessary for us to operate privately and to vette our members in order to avoid disruption from the less enlightened.“  HUMAN MEAT MENU  The current menu listed on the site includes Sirloin Steak (human meat, flame-broiled 8oz), Liver and Mushroom Pirozhi (“a Russian version of pierogies, baked rather than boiled, with a savory filling of wild mushrooms and human liver“) and Placenta Lasagne (“an otherwise traditional lasagna with one layer of cheese substituted by minced placenta in heirloom tomato sauce, seasoned with garlic, onion and oregano”.)  Elspeth Blake, the Cannibal Club proprietor who claims to have earned her stripes working under Vincent Sardi Jr. in New York, did not immediately respond to our questions regarding where the human flesh comes from.  ‘YOUNG AND HEALTHY BODIES’  In the FAQ section of the website, Cannibal Club claims:  “Most of the businesses and institutions who supply us prefer to keep those relationships discreet. On the individual level, bodies are often bequeathed to us. For some, this is a way to supplement life insurance and offset funerary expenses. For others, such as Cannibal Club member Gwendoline Fenwich, who was served to her friends and relatives at the Club in January of 2008, being prepared as a meal, and thereby reborn into the bodies of the living, is an attractive alternative to the more the traditional practices of burial and cremation.“  The revelation that Hollywood royalty, pop stars and cable TV anchors consume human flesh when they are in Los Angeles is merely the latest example of public figures being exposed as dark figures, reveling in the darkness.

The private restaurant operates a strict vetting policy, according to the website:  “It is necessary for us to operate privately and to vette our members in order to avoid disruption from the less enlightened.“  HUMAN MEAT MENU  The current menu listed on the site includes Sirloin Steak (human meat, flame-broiled 8oz), Liver and Mushroom Pirozhi (“a Russian version of pierogies, baked rather than boiled, with a savory filling of wild mushrooms and human liver“) and Placenta Lasagne (“an otherwise traditional lasagna with one layer of cheese substituted by minced placenta in heirloom tomato sauce, seasoned with garlic, onion and oregano”.)  Elspeth Blake, the Cannibal Club proprietor who claims to have earned her stripes working under Vincent Sardi Jr. in New York, did not immediately respond to our questions regarding where the human flesh comes from.  ‘YOUNG AND HEALTHY BODIES’  In the FAQ section of the website, Cannibal Club claims:  “Most of the businesses and institutions who supply us prefer to keep those relationships discreet. On the individual level, bodies are often bequeathed to us. For some, this is a way to supplement life insurance and offset funerary expenses. For others, such as Cannibal Club member Gwendoline Fenwich, who was served to her friends and relatives at the Club in January of 2008, being prepared as a meal, and thereby reborn into the bodies of the living, is an attractive alternative to the more the traditional practices of burial and cremation.“  The revelation that Hollywood royalty, pop stars and cable TV anchors consume human flesh when they are in Los Angeles is merely the latest example of public figures being exposed as dark figures, reveling in the darkness. Jay-Z described Jesus Christ as “the original fake news“ late in 2017. Miley Cyrus said “Hail Satan” on live radio and claimed she has a closer relationship with the devil than with her “earthly father”, Billy R","Prominent Figures Linked to Controversial Cannibal Restaurant in Los Angeles

In a shocking turn of events, leaked documents have shed light on the clandestine activities taking place at the notorious Cannibal Club, an exclusive restaurant tucked away in the city of Los Angeles. With rumors swirling for years regarding its patrons and the nature of its offerings, the recent revelations have brought to light some unexpected names among its elite clientele. Katy Perry, Meryl Streep, Anderson Cooper, as well as Chelsea Clinton, have all been connected to this secretive establishment.

Under the guise of being at the forefront of experimental cuisine, the Cannibal Club takes pride in serving its unique fare to what they refer to as ""L.A.'s cultural elite."" The restaurant openly admits to specializing in the preparation of human meat sourced from young and healthy individuals. While this admission may be unsettling to most, it is worth noting that the club's visiting chefs are said to hail from various corners of the globe, providing them with the freedom to practice their craft without compromise or convention.

According to their website, the Cannibal Club boasts an exclusive clientele made up of celebrated figures from the realms of film, literature, and entertainment. On event nights, guests are treated to avant-garde performances, intellectual discussions, and mesmerizing musical performances, all in the spirit of celebrating artistic excellence and the boundless nature of the human spirit.

Chef de Cuisine Sophie Laffite describes each dish as a ""study in taste and elegance,"" emphasizing that the meat served is meticulously chosen from the young and healthy. In a peculiar tradition, reminiscent of anthropology practices in certain primitive societies, the club regards the consumption of human flesh as a tribute to the departed, who are believed to be reborn through their consumption.

While the Cannibal Club appears intriguing, gaining access to this private establishment proves to be a challenge. The club's website highlights their strict vetting policy, designed to ensure that its members align with their enlightened ideals and to prevent any disruption from the less-enlightened masses.

A glimpse into their current menu reveals unusual offerings such as flame-broiled Sirloin Steak made from human meat, Liver and Mushroom Pirozhi, a baked Russian delicacy featuring a savory filling of wild mushrooms and human liver, as well as Placenta Lasagne, a unique twist on the traditional dish with minced placenta substituting one layer of cheese.

When questioned about the sources of their human meat, Elspeth Blake, the proprietor of the Cannibal Club, who boasts experience under Vincent Sardi Jr. in New York, remained tight-lipped on the matter, declining to provide further details.

Adding to the already unsettling nature of this revelation, the club's FAQ section explains that many suppliers prefer to maintain their anonymity, while individuals often bequeath their bodies to the establishment for various reasons. For some, this serves as an unconventional solution for supplementing life insurance or offsetting funeral expenses. Others, like Gwendoline Fenwich, a member of the Cannibal Club, have opted to be prepared as a meal, viewing it as an alternative to more traditional burial or cremation practices.

This shocking news, linking Hollywood figures, pop icons, and cable news anchors with the consumption of human flesh, is just another example of public figures engaging in darker activities. Recent episodes have seen Jay-Z referring to Jesus Christ as ""the original fake news"" and Miley Cyrus openly declaring ""Hail Satan"" on live radio, while boldly claiming a closer bond with the devil than her own earthly father.

The revelation of these unsettling connections raises numerous questions and casts a shadow over those who have frequented this establishment. As the public grapples with the implications of such revelations, it remai"

According to a new report, the Real Housewives of New Jersey star is planning to cash in on her husband Joe Giudice’s deportation proceedings.  If you recall, it was reported weeks ago that a judge had ruled that Joe should be deported upon his release from prison, where he is currently serving a 41-month-prison sentence for bank and wire fraud. Well now, sources are telling Radar Online that Bravo has offered Teresa $500,000 to film a special about his deportation.  “Teresa was offered big bucks to film a special about Joe’s deportation and she agreed to do it,” an insider revealed. “Half a million dollars to share the story on camera.”  And this story is believable because this isn’t Teresa’s first rodeo when it comes to cashing in on her crimes legal drama!  “It is going to be like the other specials when she was in prison and will show how she and Joe and the girls are handling the scary prospect of Joe getting deported,” added the source.  IS TERESA BEGGING PRESIDENT TRUMP TO STOP JOE’S DEPORTATION?  Earlier this year, an Immigration official confirmed that “records show that an immigration judge ordered Mr. Giudice be removed from the United States on March 14, 2018.”  A source close to Teresa adds that she needs the Bravo money as Joe tries to appeal the deportation order.  “Teresa will do anything for the money. She never stops thinking about taking care of her girls and she agreed to this so that they would have money for college. She is a good mom and wants to provide for her children,” the source stated.  Joe will reportedly be turned over to ICE custody upon his March 2019 release, although it is likely he could be released earlier than March which would mean an earlier deportation back to Italy.

As previously reported, a judge recently ruled that Joe would be deported once he completes his 41-month prison sentence for bank and wire fraud. According to sources, Bravo has offered Teresa $500,000 to film a special documenting Joe's deportation. Despite the seemingly outrageous nature of this story, it holds credibility given Teresa's history of leveraging her legal troubles for financial gain. The special will provide insight into how Teresa, Joe, and their family are coping with the unsettling possibility of Joe's deportation. Earlier this year, an immigration judge ordered Joe's removal from the United States, prompting Teresa to consider the offer from Bravo in light of Joe's impending appeal. Recognizing her responsibility as a mother, Teresa is determined to secure a stable future for her children, which is why she has agreed to participate in this project. Joe is expected to be transferred to ICE custody upon his release in March 2019, and there is a possibility that he could be deported to Italy even earlier.

A representative for the ""Ocean's Eleven"" star tells the site that the story made by National Enquirer ""is fabricated.""","George Clooney, the renowned Oscar-winning actor, is reportedly under investigation by the FBI for alleged money laundering. According to the National Enquirer, Clooney has been implicated in an FBI probe after presenting his astonished dinner party guests with an astonishing gift of $1 million in cash, carefully concealed within a luxurious designer bag. The publication has revealed that a secretive government investigation surrounds the ""Money Monster"" actor and the extravagant dinner party that gave rise to it. Sources suggest that this lavish event was organized to commemorate the resounding success of Clooney's own tequila brand, Casamigos.

The article goes on to describe Clooney's generous nature and his strong desire to distribute his wealth. Allegedly, the actor intended to inject an element of surprise and amusement among his attendees, aware that such a grandiose gesture of handing out $1 million in cash to each guest would prompt curiosity and perhaps some awkwardness when depositing the money in the bank. The insider claims that the depositor would have inevitably invited scrutiny from the FBI, who would have been called in for questioning. In an effort to corroborate these claims, the source emphasizes that Clooney undoubtedly arranged the party and bestowed upon each guest both the substantial sum of money and an elegant designer bag as a memento.

Regrettably, these circumstances pose a significant challenge for George Clooney at this particular moment in life. With the impending arrival of his twins and the inevitable association with government investigators, this additional burden is far from ideal. However, it is crucial to note that Gossip Cop, a reputable source, has debunked all the aforementioned allegations. According to their investigation, there is no genuine FBI probe, scandal, or any indication that Clooney has attracted federal attention. The representative of the esteemed ""Ocean's Eleven"" star has categorically stated that the story, as presented by the National Enquirer, is completely fabricated."

When Corey wanted to fool around again, Charlie was not interested.”  According to Brascia, Haim also told him the co-stars had consensual sex years later, while Haim was in his mid-to-late 20s.  Brascia said: “Haim told me he had sex with Sheen again.  “He claimed he didn’t like it and was finally over Sheen. He said Charlie was a loser.”  Brascia is also alleged to have had a sexual relationship with Haim, who died in 2010 at the age of 38, a claim that Brascia “emphatically denied” when asked about it by The Enquirer  It comes as the Lost Boys actor's regular co-star and friend Corey Feldman continues to speak out about child sex abuse in Hollywood.  The actor, now 46, has filed a report with police claiming he was sexually assaulted by Hollywood figures as a youngster.  He has previously alleged industry figures molested young actors including himself and Haim. He has not publicly named any individual as being subject of his allegations.  The Los Angeles Police Department said it is investigating the claim and that no arrests have been made."

They don’t come easily.  But two things happened after the previous review. First, a man who was at the next table wrote to me to say how much he loved Stanley’s. He had no vested interest, but was talking as a well-dined eater about town. Later, I found out that chef and co-owner Stephen McArdle had something more important on his hands than my dinner that night. His son had been born hours before.  If that doesn’t earn a second chance, nothing will. So we’re tucked in at a small table under the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted a soft green. There’s a candle in a wax-crusted wine bottle on the table and high-class jazz standards on the sound system.  For the moment, it feels like we’re not in Dublin. We could be in a city anywhere and lucky enough to find a place we’ll remember fondly when we get home.  The menu is chalked up on the wall and Liam has already ordered some cod croquettes, balls of soft fluffy fish in crispy lagging jackets sitting in a small puddle of silken house mayonnaise.  The star of Stanley’s is Morgan Vanderkamer. She’s the sommelier here. But don’t let that put you off. Bad sommeliers are pretentious up-sellers, there to push diners towards the wallet-busting bruisers on the wine list. Vanderkamer has taken the nonsense out of the role and will open your mind to new ideas about what to drink with your food. If you thought sherry was for fogeys and posers, she will change your mind. So we have ice-cold glasses of manzanilla to cut through the fluffy cod croquettes. We are in excellent hands.  The main event is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. We’re going with an oloroso, the ruby-coloured sherry that gets its colour and kick from time and ageing. There are two on the menu, Vanderkamer says. One is good; the other is “amazing”, and priced accordingly, she warns. With a €16 plate of food between us, we push the sherry cask out and live it large on the oloroso at €13 a glass. It is a good decision.  There’s a small farmyard on that €16 charcuterie plate: generous slices of duck ham, smoked cured slices of moist pink meat. The duck ham is the soulmate of the apricot puree dotted on one side of the plate. The sharp pickled gherkins sing with the “bacon and cabbage”, a slice of ham hock terrine wrapped in crinkly soft leaves of bright-green savoy cabbage. There are two small delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, delicate to the point of dissolving on contact with the tongue. The pear and vanilla sauce, in a small ramekin, takes the sweetness of the liver to another even more decadent place.  Just in case there isn’t enough on the plate (there is), we’ve ordered a plate of the bean and chorizo stew. The beans are in fact chick peas – but that’s even better in my book – and the chorizo has been minced to a small rubble that sits on top of the soupy mix.

Dinner for two, with sherries a","The importance of unplanned experiences should not be underestimated, as they can often surpass our expectations. This is precisely why St Valentine's Day fails to resonate with those who possess sound judgement. The act of designating a specific day for romance is as delightful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon.

Unbeknownst to us, our spontaneous decision to venture out to Stanley's on St Andrew's Street in Dublin, rather than our usual spot, is unfolding downstairs in the cozy wine bar. Having dined here previously and enjoyed it, except for the slight oversalting of the fish, I am giving it a second chance, which is not something I offer freely.

However, two events occurred after my previous review that altered my perspective. Firstly, a gentleman seated at the adjacent table contacted me to express his love for Stanley's. He had no personal interest in the matter and spoke purely from the standpoint of an experienced diner within the city. Secondly, I discovered that the chef and co-owner, Stephen McArdle, had a more significant responsibility than attending to my dinner that night; his son had been born mere hours before.

Given these circumstances, it is only fair to grant Stanley's another opportunity to impress. As we settle at a small table beneath the gently sloping ceiling, the soft green walls and a candle flickering within a wax-crusted wine bottle set a serene ambiance. The sound system fills the air with refined jazz standards, momentarily transporting us outside the confines of Dublin. It feels as though we have stumbled upon a hidden gem, a place that will be fondly remembered long after we return home.

The menu is elegantly inscribed on the wall, and Liam, my dining companion, has already ordered a serving of cod croquettes. These delicately encased balls of fluffy fish, enveloped in a crispy outer layer, rest upon a small pool of velvety house-made mayonnaise.

The star of Stanley's is, without a doubt, the sommelier, Morgan Vanderkamer. The word ""sommelier"" often carries certain negative connotations, bringing to mind pretentious individuals intent on upselling guests to exorbitantly priced wines. However, Vanderkamer has successfully eradicated such theatrics from her role and strives to broaden one's horizons when it comes to pairing beverages with food. If you once believed that sherry was solely reserved for the elderly or those seeking to appear sophisticated, Vanderkamer's expertise will undoubtedly change your perspective. Thus, we find ourselves savoring glasses of ice-cold manzanilla, expertly complementing the delicate cod croquettes. We are undoubtedly in capable hands.

The main highlight of our evening is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. Opting for an oloroso, a ruby-hued sherry imbued with depth and character derived from time and aging, we consult Vanderkamer, who advises us that two options are available. One is good, while the other is deemed ""amazing"" and carries a corresponding price tag. With a €16 plate of delectable fare shared between us, we decide to indulge in the extraordinary oloroso, priced at €13 per glass. It proves to be a wise choice.

The €16 charcuterie plate offers a delightful assortment of flavors reminiscent of a small farmyard. Generous slices of duck ham, exuding a delicate smokiness and succulence, find their perfect match in the accompanying apricot puree. The sharpness of the pickled gherkins harmonizes with the ""bacon and cabbage,"" a delectable ham hock terrine encased in vibrant green savoy cabbage leaves. Two delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, exquisitely delicate to the point of dissolving upon contact with the tongue, are uplifted by a pear and vanilla sauce served in a petite ramekin, elevating the sweetness of the liver to even greater decadence.

As if the charcuterie plate were not enough (which it certainly is), we have also ordered a plate of bean and chorizo stew. The supposed ""beans"" are, in fact, chickpeas, and in my opinion, this substituti"

DeMille estate — check out pics of the lavish mansion here.  Angelina Jolie, 41, has a new home in Los Angeles…and it’s stunning. It’s been rumored for weeks that the 41-year-old had plans to purchase Cecil B. DeMille’s historic mansion, and now, she’s bit the bullet, putting down a $25 million offer, according to TMZ. The amount was reportedly accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow.  Cecil’s home, which he lived in until his death in 1959, is considered one of the greatest properties in L.A., and Angie will have some famous neighbors, including Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman and Ellen Pompeo. There’s tons of space for the six kids, too — the house boasts 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, plus a spacious backyard.  This huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53. The possibility of that big move happening seemed even more likely after reports surfaced on April 12 that Angie had met and fallen in love with a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.  The actress is reportedly already serious with this mystery man, and a family friend told InTouch that she’s even planning on marrying him! However, we also know that Brad and Angie’s divorce has been much more amicable recently, and she’s been letting him spend more and more time with the kids.

Amidst rumors that the actress is marrying a British businessman, she’s put permanent roots down in California by purchasing the massive Cecil B. DeMille estate — check out pics of the lavish mansion here.  Angelina Jolie, 41, has a new home in Los Angeles…and it’s stunning. It’s been rumored for weeks that the 41-year-old had plans to purchase Cecil B. DeMille’s historic mansion, and now, she’s bit the bullet, putting down a $25 million offer, according to TMZ. The amount was reportedly accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow.  Cecil’s home, which he lived in until his death in 1959, is considered one of the greatest properties in L.A., and Angie will have some famous neighbors, including Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman and Ellen Pompeo. There’s tons of space for the six kids, too — the house boasts 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, plus a spacious backyard.  This huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53. The possibility of that big move happening seemed even more likely after reports surfaced on April 12 that Angie had met and fallen in love with a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.  The actress is reportedly already serious with this mystery man, and a family friend told InTouch that she’s even planning on marrying him! However, we also know that Brad and Angie’s divorce has been much more amicable recently, and she’s been letting him spend more and more time with the kids.

Either way, the house is insane — check it out in the gallery above.  HollywoodLifers, what do you think of Angelina’s new house? Do you think she’s prepping for a wedding?","Angelina Jolie, 41, has recently acquired a new residence in Los Angeles worth a staggering $25 million. Speculations surrounding her alleged marriage to a British businessman have coincided with the purchase of the Cecil B. DeMille estate, a historic mansion with a remarkable reputation within the Californian real estate scene. The renowned property, formerly inhabited by Cecil B. DeMille until his passing in 1959, holds a prominent status in Los Angeles. Notably, esteemed individuals such as Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman, and Ellen Pompeo reside in this exclusive neighborhood, thus augmenting Ms. Jolie's prestigious company. Additionally, the vast mansion offers considerable space for her six children, featuring six bedrooms, ten bathrooms, and a commodious backyard. This substantial investment follows rumors of Ms. Jolie's potential relocation to London, envisaging a new working environment since her separation from Brad Pitt in September 2016. Reports emerged on April 12 indicating a blossoming romance with an undisclosed British philanthropist and businessman, further fueling speculation of an impending marriage. Simultaneously, recent developments have showcased a more harmonious dynamic between Ms. Jolie and Mr. Pitt as she has allowed him more access to their children. It is plausible that her decision to stay in Los Angeles is an effort to ensure that their children - Pax, Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne, and Knox - maintain a strong relationship with their father. Whether wedding preparations are underway or not, the grandeur and opulence of the mansion are undeniable. Explore the elegance of the property in the accompanying gallery. We would appreciate your thoughts - what are your impressions on Angelina Jolie's new abode?"

Jeff instructed each tribe to choose a leader: Malolo selected Brendan, while Chris volunteered for Naviti. Jeff also told the castaways they would only start with a machete, pot, a fishing kit, and a smaller supply of rice. Reward Challenge: A designated runner will have to race through a series of obstacles to dig up three sets of keys. Then, a designated puzzle solver will use the keys to unlock a slide puzzle. The first person to finish their puzzle wins a massive shelter building kit reward for their tribe. Additionally, the losing tribe will be forced to forfeit their fishing kit. However, if the tribe leader decides to forfeit the challenge during the puzzle solving portion, their tribe will get to keep the fishing kit, but the opposing tribe will get 20 eggs and flint in addition to the shelter building kit. For Malolo and Naviti, respectively, Michael and Sebastian were selected to run the course, while Laurel and Desiree were selected for the puzzle. Chris pulled the lever on Desiree, preserving Naviti’s fishing kit, but giving the larger reward to Malolo. As the Malolo tribe set up their shelter and got to know each other, Jacob openly stated his intention to search for a hidden immunity idol, causing his tribemates to distrust him. He also poured some of the tribe’s rice in his dirty sock to see if a clue was hidden in the jar, though there was not. Meanwhile at the Naviti camp, a power struggle started between Chris and Domenick, who questioned Chris’s decision to forfeit the opening challenge. Immunity Challenge: Each tribe will have to race across a net bridge to where two bags are hanging. Working together, they will then need to untie the bags to obtain a pair of ropes. Using the ropes, the tribe will need to slide a sled full of big puzzle pieces through a course. At the end of the course, they will need to solve a cube puzzle to win immunity. Naviti won the challenge, and also received a flint reward, as Malolo already had flint after winning the first reward challenge. For winning the immunity challenge, Naviti had to send one person from Malolo to Ghost Island, where they would be immune from the vote; Naviti sent Jacob after he declared Malolo was the best tribe in Survivor history. On Ghost Island, Jacob had to break an urn to play a game for an advantage; if he lost, he would have to forfeit his vote at the next Tribal Council. He subsequently won a game of chance which gave him Sierra’s legacy advantage from Game Changers. He had to will it to someone from Naviti, and he chose Morgan. He also made a fake idol. At Malolo, the tribe had to come up with a new plan, as Jacob was their intended target. Gonzalez rallied votes against Donathan for being the tribe’s weakest link, but at Tribal Council, her paranoia got the better of her as she whispered to her tribemates, asking who they were targeting that night. Although everyone told her they were targeting Donathan, it was revealed that they had lied to her, and Gonzalez was unanimously blindsided, becoming the first person voted out. At Naviti, Domenick searched for a hidden immunity idol in the middle of the night, which he eventually found; it was revealed to be Andrea’s idol from Caramoan. The next morning, he attempted to bury the hatchet with Chris, but the tension still lingered between the two. Domenick told Chris he found an idol moments after telling him the opposite, which caused Chris to distrust him. At Malolo, Jacob kept the legacy advantage information to himself and told his tribemates he found an idol on Ghost Island, but that he had left the paper behind, making Brendan suspicious.

Another member will need to gather all of the marked buoys to the finish, where the last four members will need to get all eight in a basket to win immunity and a comfort reward of chairs, pillows, blankets, and a washboard. Naviti easily won after James could not even dive a foot in the water. Donathan panicked before eventually diving down and releasing the buoys for Malolo. Naviti sent Donathan to Ghost Island, and the urn he smashed was a dud. At Malolo, Stephanie considered working with Jacob to blindside Michael, but Jacob spilled the beans about the legacy advantage to Stephanie. At Tribal Council, Libby and Michael voted against James in case Jacob did indeed have a real idol, but ultimately, the tribe stuck to the original plan, sending Jacob out of the game. 528 2 "" Only Time Will Tell"" Recap 1.7/7[6] March 7, 2018 ( ) 8.23[6] 14[7] The morning after Jacob's elimination, Jeff announced a tribe swap.

At the new Naviti tribe, Chris tried to rally votes against Domenick, but his attitude set Angela and Libby off. Morgan was suspicious of Chris, and she and Libby aligned.

The revelatory moment occurs toward the end of the trailer, when Han and Chewie are flying the Millennium Falcon. After Han asks Chewie how he knows to fly the ship, the young smuggler gets a surprising answer.  “190 years old?” Han asks, translating Chewbacca’s response for the viewer. “You look great!”  Based on the new information, it isn’t too difficult to guess Chewbacca’s age in Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope, the first time he appeared. We know there’s a 19-year gap between the events of Star Wars: Episode III — Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope, with Solo taking place just a few years after Episode III. A timeline from Del Ray Books, the official publisher of the Star Wars novels, helps fill in the blanks.  Best guesses place the events of Solo approximately 12 or 13 years before A New Hope, meaning Chewbacca is either 202- or 203-years-old. That makes Chewbacca about 28 years younger than a popular Wookiepedia entry claims.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “I actually haven’t been to school,” he said. He added of his bullies: “Why do you bully? What’s the point of it? It makes me feel awful.”  This Morning/ITV  Kimberly said that Keaton expressed that he didn’t want to return even to the middle school even “when the whole world wanted to come and eat lunch with him.”  “I’ve struggled anyway especially being this close to Christmas break, but after seeing how big it got, I mean it just seems like maybe we should let it die down a little bit before we made any decisions so that we could kind of have a reality of what life is gonna be like,” she continued.  Love What Matters/Facebook  Keaton, of Knoxville, captivated the Internet earlier this month after a video uploaded by his mother showed the boy in tears as he lamented the bullying he’s endured at school. In the video, Keaton revealed that the bullies, “make fun of my nose. They call me ugly. They say I have no friends.”  However, Keaton’s emotional story took a turn when photos surfaced showing the family with Confederate flags. They faced more criticism when rumors circulated that the family used Keaton’s story for financial gain.  “I’ve said over and over, I’m an adult, I know who I am. I’m obviously sorry that it has offended so many people, but the backlash to my children…” Kimberly said during the morning show. “That’s something I wouldn’t wish on anybody.”  She added that the backlash has “brought the bullies out.” Kimberly also denied being racist in interviews with ABC and CBS News.  As the backlash seemingly began to subside, the family faced a new wave of criticism as photos from the Facebook page of Shawn White, Keaton’s allegedly estranged father, showed him sharing white supremacist propaganda.

On Liam’s first single, “Strip That Down,” he’s dissed One Direction plain as day. “You know I used to be in 1D, now I’m out free,” he sings. “People want me for one thing, that’s not me. I’m not changing the way that I used to be, I just want to have fun and get rowdy.”    But with nearly all remaining members of One Direction releasing new music of their own within weeks of each other, this song is not the only opportunity Payne has had to make his thoughts on his bandmates known. Speaking with Music Choice, he complimented Niall Horan’s new singles, but Harry Styles, not so much. “I’ll be honest with you, it’s not my sort of music. It’s not something I’d listen to,” he said. But he did have a quick save: “I think he did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. That’s the way I’d put it best, I think.” Liam also noted that Harry would probably say the same about his music since Harry doesn’t listen to hip-hop. “My song’s more ‘Rack City’ and his song is more of a different era to something I’d listen to, I guess,” he said. “Strip That Down” does feature a rapper, Migos’s Quavo, but a redux of the only song of note that Tyga has ever made it is not.",1,en,"Oh boy.

In this song, he addresses his departure from the group, highlighting his desire to express his true self and have a more liberated musical journey. While some might interpret his lyrics as a diss towards his former bandmates, it is crucial to remember that artists often explore new genres and styles during their solo careers to discover their own artistic identities.

However, it is not only in his music that Payne has expressed his thoughts on his fellow bandmates. When asked about Niall Horan's new singles, he spoke highly of them and appreciated Horan's artistic choices. In contrast, he mentioned that Harry Styles' music was not his personal taste, but acknowledged that Styles had successfully pursued his own artistic vision. Payne explained that their musical preferences differ, with Styles inclined towards genres other than hip-hop, which is the main inspiration behind his own song.

It is important to analyze Payne's music and interviews in a fair and open-minded manner, understanding that artists have the right to explore and evolve their artistry. While ""Strip That Down"" includes features from renowned rapper Quavo, it is not an attempt to replicate any specific artist's work. Payne's intention is to showcase his unique style, which draws inspiration from hip-hop culture and creates a distinct sound.

With each member of One Direction now pursuing individual music careers, it is natural for them to explore different genres and musical directions. Liam Payne's solo endeavors should be evaluated based on his own artistic growth and the ability to carve out his own path in the music industry."

gossipcop-4796409702,"Kim Kardashian is allegedly “phasing out” mom Kris Jenner, particularly when it comes to her responsibilities as her longtime manager, amid reports Kim is ready for a total image overhaul after returning to the spotlight following her October robbery.  That’s according to a new report by Radar Online, who’s claiming that the mother-daughter duo could be caught in a nasty feud as a source alleged that Kardashian has had somewhat of an epiphany during her time away from the spotlight and allegedly has now opened her eyes to see how Jenner “used her” to build the Kardashian brand.  According to the site, Kim is ready to project a very different image from the uber-glamorous money flaunting Kardashian fans used to know and is allegedly ready to kick mom Kris to the curb, at least professionally, in order to do so.  A source alleged to the site this week that Kim now “seems to be thinking that Kris used her to get where she is today,” which Radar Online is alleging could have led to a nasty feud between Jenner and her daughter as well as the reality star reportedly making a pretty big business decision when it comes to her mom.  “[Kim] will never think of [Kris] in the same way again,” the source said of Jenner’s supposed drama with her daughter amid reports she believes Jenner has been “using” her for years.  The site then went on to report that Kim is now in the process of projecting her new toned-down image amid the feud claims with Kris, revealing that Jenner may no longer play such a big part in Kardashian’s career going forward.  “Kim hired a transition team to make sure that she gives off a different image than she did previously,” the source said of Jenner and her daughter potentially parting ways professionally, claiming that “part of this process includes phasing out [Kris’s] management.”  While Kris and Kim have not commented on the claims, this isn’t the first time it’s been reported that Kardashian may be looking to distance herself from Jenner, at least professionally, in the wake of her October robbery in Paris.  Radar Online claimed back in October that Kim Kardashian had grown wise to Kris Jenner’s “money making machine” after taking some downtime at the end of 2016, alleging at the time that Kim has been so busy with her career that she’s failed to realize how much Jenner, who is often referred to as her “momager,” had been controlling her life and career.  “Kim never realized how much [Kris] and the money-making machine was controlling her until this robbery,” an insider told the site of Kardashian’s feelings about Jenner at the time, months before it was reported that the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is allegedly looking to “phase out” Kris from her career.  “Kim is just starting to think that maybe Kris’s intentions were not pure all along,” continued the source in October, adding that Kim has been doing a lot of thinking about her father Robert Kardashian while taking some time away which has allegedly helped her to get wise to Kris’s seemingly relentless pursuit of fame for herself and her family.  “[Kim] told her family that she wanted to be the girl that her father wanted her to be and not the girl that she became with Kris’s help,” a source revealed last year, just months before it was reported that a feud could be brewing between Kardashian and Jenner.

A source alleged to the site this week that Kim now “seems to be thinking that Kris used her to get where she is today,” which Radar Online is alleging could have led to a nasty feud between Jenner and her daughter as well as the reality star reportedly making a pretty big business decision when it comes to her mom.  “[Kim] will never think of [Kris] in the same way again,” the source said of Jenner’s supposed drama with her daughter amid reports she believes Jenner has been “using” her for years.  The site then went on to report that Kim is now in the process of projecting her new toned-down image amid the feud claims with Kris, revealing that Jenner may no longer play such a big part in Kardashian’s career going forward.  “Kim hired a transition team to make sure that she gives off a different image than she did previously,” the source said of Jenner and her daughter potentially parting ways professionally, claiming that “part of this process includes phasing out [Kris’s] management.”  While Kris and Kim have not commented on the claims, this isn’t the first time it’s been reported that Kardashian may be looking to distance herself from Jenner, at least professionally, in the wake of her October robbery in Paris.  Radar Online claimed back in October that Kim Kardashian had grown wise to Kris Jenner’s “money making machine” after taking some downtime at the end of 2016, alleging at the time that Kim has been so busy with her career that she’s failed to realize how much Jenner, who is often referred to as her “momager,” had been controlling her life and career.  “Kim never realized how much [Kris] and the money-making machine was controlling her until this robbery,” an insider told the site of Kardashian’s feelings about Jenner at the time, months before it was reported that the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is allegedly looking to “phase out” Kris from her career.  “Kim is just starting to think that maybe Kris’s intentions were not pure all along,” continued the source in October, adding that Kim has been doing a lot of thinking about her father Robert Kardashian while taking some time away which has allegedly helped her to get wise to Kris’s seemingly relentless pursuit of fame for herself and her family.  “[Kim] told her family that she wanted to be the girl that her father wanted her to be and not the girl that she became with Kris’s help,” a source revealed last year, just months before it was reported that a feud could be brewing between Kardashian and Jenner.  What do you think of reports claiming Kim Kardashian and mom Kris Jenner could be caught in a feud amid claims Kim is attempting to “phase out” her mother’s management?  [Featured Image by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images]","According to a recent report by Radar Online, there is speculation that Kim Kardashian is making significant changes in her professional relationship with her mother, Kris Jenner. Apparently, Kim has been reflecting on her time away from the spotlight, specifically after her robbery in October, and has come to the realization that Jenner may have used her to further the Kardashian brand. This alleged epiphany has prompted Kim to seek a different image for herself, one that differs from the extravagant and money-driven persona she has been known for. As a result, she is said to be distancing herself from her mother both personally and professionally.

An anonymous source claimed to Radar Online that Kim no longer sees her mother in the same light, believing that Jenner manipulated the situation to her advantage. This revelation has allegedly sparked a potential feud between the two, leading Kim to make a significant business decision regarding her mother's involvement in her career. Although both Kris and Kim have yet to comment on these rumors, it is not the first time that Kim has been reported to consider distancing herself from her mother, at least on a professional level.

In October of last year, Radar Online reported that Kim had become aware of what they referred to as Kris Jenner's ""money making machine."" This awareness supposedly came about during Kim's downtime at the end of 2016, revealing that she had been oblivious to how much control Jenner had exerted over her life and career. At the time, an insider revealed that the robbery in Paris served as a wake-up call for Kim, leading her to question her mother's true intentions. The source explained that Kim had been contemplating her late father, Robert Kardashian, during her time away, which ultimately shed light on Jenner's seemingly relentless pursuit of fame for herself and the family.

While it remains uncertain whether these claims hold any truth, Radar Online has also reported that Kim has hired a team to guide her through a transformation process aimed at projecting a more subdued image. As a part of this change, it is suggested that Jenner's role in Kim's career may be diminished.

It is essential to note that neither Kim nor Kris has addressed these alleged disputes. However, the possibility of a feud arising between the two is causing speculation among fans and observers alike."

The news follows reports that the 37-year-old reality star is expecting her fourth child, although it remains unclear whether the father is her ex-boyfriend Scott Disick or the younger boxer-model Younes Bendjima. 

Kourtney and Justin were seen together at The Peppermint Club in Hollywood while Scott accompanied Kourtney's sister, Kim Kardashian, on her trip to Dubai. It appears that Scott's behavior during the trip caused some tension, as he went missing without informing anyone of his whereabouts. It was his responsibility to ensure Kim's safety, but he had apparently overslept for a whopping ten hours. 

These recent events are somewhat surprising, as Scott and Kourtney had just reconciled their relationship last month. However, their history together suggests that this type of drama is not altogether unexpected.

Additionally, she sent good wishes to him on Mar. 1 — when Shelton was reportedly attempting to power through a Houston date while sick with the flu — and shared his latest video, “I Lived It” with a glowing string of hashtags.      So if the breakup is fake news, what spurred the rumors? According to In Touch‘s “insider” source, all of Stefani’s social media support is “a desperate attempt to ignore the truth,” and Shelton dumped her due to her “neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband, and her jealousy of him and other women.”  If this is to be believed, current Voice champion Chloe Kohanski was a factor in the breakup — Coach Shelton was apparently getting too close for Stefani’s comfort — as well as Shelton’s ex-wife Miranda Lambert, with whom the outlet claims he has rekindled a friendship and is “sharing intimate details” of his life.  Shelton isn’t reciprocating Stefani’s loving social media deluge — but then again, he’s never been one to do so.

Stefani has made multiple appearances with Shelton on stage, and even posted an Instagram photo on March 14th showing the couple embracing during Shelton's ""Country Music Freaks"" tour. This is not the first time Stefani has shared such intimate pictures since February, as she previously posted images of a jumbotron kiss on February 25th. On March 11th, she also shared a picture of herself hanging out with country artist Carly Pearce, who is an opener on Shelton's tour. In addition, she sent Shelton good wishes on March 1st when he performed in Houston while sick with the flu, and shared his latest video, ""I Lived It,"" on her social media accounts. So, why did the rumors of their breakup start in the first place? In Touch's ""insider"" claims that Stefani's social media posts are merely a desperate attempt to hide the truth. According to this source, Shelton ended the relationship due to Stefani's ""neediness and all the drama,"" which allegedly stems from her demanding ex-husband and her jealousy towards Shelton and other women. The article also suggests that the recent winner of The Voice, Chloe Kohanski, played a role in Stefani's jealousy, as well as Shelton's ex-wife, Miranda Lambert, with whom he has supposedly rekindled a friendship. Interestingly, Shelton has not reciprocated Stefani's public displays of affection on social media, but still maintains a picture of her as his profile photo.

gossipcop-1634815619,"California is “the darkest state in the Union,” according to country singer Dolly Parton, who claims that the state has been hit with a series of “Biblical disasters” in recent times as punishment for “embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Parton predicted Los Angeles will suffer a similar fate to Sodom and Gomorrah, the Biblical cities synonymous with vice, darkness and impenitent sin.  “California just keeps on being hit by disaster after disaster as foretold in the Bible,” the Grammy Award-winning entertainer and businesswoman told guests at Dolly Parton’s Stampede, a dinner and entertainment evening.  “Pestilence, and epidemics, and crime, and disease. And you know what? They don’t even realize what is happening to them. They are so corrupted, they can’t even see what is right in front of their eyes.”  “First they had the drought that lasted years and years, killing off billions and billions of dollars in crops, and making the soil so incredibly dry that a large rainstorm could easily turn into a major flood.  “Then they had the fires. Awful, awful fires. Historical, deadly fires. Thousands lost their homes, scores lost their lives and their livelihoods. Did you know the Thomas fire is still burning? In the winter!“  “And now they just had dozens of homes destroyed by mudslides,” Tennessee-born Parton said, making reference to the mudslides that have killed 15 people, with the toll expected to climb above 30. The mudslide hit an affluent part of California, and damaged Oprah Winfrey’s house.  “When they get hit with the ‘Big One‘, Parton said, referencing the popular name for the super quake expected to rock California in the future, “then we will know that the End Times have truly begun.”  “And don’t forget the sexual abuse scandals rocking Hollywood. They are being punished for embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Is California suffering from bad weather and bad luck, or is Parton right? Could a vengeful God be punishing California for decades of vice and sin?  Parton, who has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and been nominated for two Academy Awards, has previously stated that she considers herself an entertainer, and doesn’t believe it is her role to get involved with politics.  At last year’s Emmys, Parton was joined onstage by Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda to present an award. Tomlin and Fonda took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump, but Parton refused to join in, maintaining a dignified silence.",1,en,"California is “the darkest state in the Union,” according to country singer Dolly Parton, who claims that the state has been hit with a series of “Biblical disasters” in recent times as punishment for “embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Parton predicted Los Angeles will suffer a similar fate to Sodom and Gomorrah, the Biblical cities synonymous with vice, darkness and impenitent sin.  “California just keeps on being hit by disaster after disaster as foretold in the Bible,” the Grammy Award-winning entertainer and businesswoman told guests at Dolly Parton’s Stampede, a dinner and entertainment evening.  “Pestilence, and epidemics, and crime, and disease.

Tomlin and Fonda took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump, but Parton refused to join in, maintaining a dignified silence.","According to country singer Dolly Parton, California has experienced numerous hardships lately, leading her to believe that it is ""the darkest state in the Union."" Parton attributes these challenges to the state's alleged embrace of Satan and rejection of God. During a recent gathering at Dolly Parton's Stampede, a dinner and entertainment event, the Grammy Award-winning entertainer and businesswoman expressed her concern for California's ongoing misfortunes. She forewarned that Los Angeles might even face a fate similar to that of Sodom and Gomorrah, cities associated in the Bible with vice, darkness, and unrepentant sin.

Parton expressed that California seems oblivious to the succession of calamities befalling them, including pests, epidemics, crime, and disease. She emphasized how the state's corruption has blinded its inhabitants to the evident turmoil. Parton discussed the prolonged drought that devastated their crops and rendered the soil excessively dry, increasing the potential for significant flooding during heavy rainstorms. She also lamented the devastating and historically unprecedented fires that have decimated countless homes and lives, highlighting the continuing Thomas fire that defies the usual expectations by persisting into winter. Additionally, she referred to the recent mudslides resulting in the destruction of numerous homes, with a rising death toll that has already claimed 15 lives, and expected to surpass 30. Notably, these mudslides impacted an affluent area of California, even damaging Oprah Winfrey's house.

Parton went on to speculate that when California eventually experiences the anticipated ""Big One,"" a massive earthquake that might strike the state, it would be a sign of the beginning of the End Times. She also mentioned the ongoing sexual abuse scandals in Hollywood, suggesting that these issues further support her belief that California is facing divine retribution for its alleged adherence to Satan and rejection of God.

While contemplating whether California's misfortunes are a result of bad weather and sheer bad luck or if Dolly Parton's claim holds some truth, it is essential to note that Parton herself has previously stated that she considers herself an entertainer and refrains from engaging in politics. At the previous year's Emmys, when Parton shared the stage with Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda, the latter two took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump. However, Parton chose to maintain her dignified silence, honoring her commitment to her role as an entertainer."

""When you're thrust into the spotlight like that, it can affect you. My mistake was taking our relationship for granted.""  Baier says the high-profile nature of the relationship was part of the problem (which is odd, because he never would have met Amber if she weren't on TV), but he also accepts responsibility for being a less-than-stellar partner:  ""What I've learned from this is you have to do the work,"" he told the outlet.

Worked together: Jennifer and Justin are shown in a still from the 2012 comedy Wanderlust","Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux reportedly attempted to salvage their marriage while vacationing in Mexico with their friends, Jason Bateman and his wife. The Hollywood couple, who announced their separation on Thursday after two and a half years of marriage, disclosed in a statement released by their publicists that their decision to part ways was mutual and made with love at the end of last year. 

During their trip to Cabo San Lucas, the couple was captured in photographs taken on January 1, joined by Jason Bateman and his wife Amanda Anka. Sources revealed that Amanda had been acting as a mediator in recent months, endeavoring to help Jennifer and Justin overcome their issues and salvage their relationship. This getaway was seen as a make-or-break vacation for the couple, with hopes of having a good time and working on their marriage after the Christmas season.

Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of their friends and the hopefulness of the trip, their endeavor to repair their relationship did not succeed. Insider accounts stated that the men and women spent time separately in Mexico, suggesting that their attempt to reconnect was unsuccessful.

Interestingly, this plan bore resemblance to Jason Bateman's 2009 romantic comedy, Couples Retreat, where four couples sought to resolve their relationship troubles at a resort. Jennifer and Jason previously starred together in the 2010 comedy-drama, The Switch, as well as the 2011 comedy, Horrible Bosses, and its 2014 sequel, Horrible Bosses 2.

In their statement announcing their split, Jennifer and Justin expressed their desire to minimize further speculation. They acknowledged that while they preferred to handle this issue privately, they felt compelled to share the truth directly due to the media's inclination to speculate and fabricate stories. They emphasized the importance of preserving the deep respect and love they have for one another, noting that anything else written about them is a fictional narrative created by someone else.

Jennifer and Justin became engaged in August 2012, after starring together in the 2012 comedy, Wanderlust. They tied the knot in August 2015 but do not have children together. Justin recently mentioned in an interview that he was not with Jennifer on her birthday in February, and would not be spending Valentine's Day with her. Prior to marrying Justin, Jennifer was famously married to Brad Pitt from 2000 to 2005. Her notable works include the TV sitcom Friends, as well as films such as Office Christmas Party, Cake, and Marley & Me."

In fact, both were seeing other people at the time and it would be several years before the pair coupled up to become one of Hollywood’s most enduring relationships. Although their characters Alex P. Keaton and Ellen Reed were loved up on Family Ties, in real life Pollan was in a serious long-term relationship with Kevin Bacon and Fox was dating Facts of Life actress Nancy McKeon. ""I always thought [Tracy] was cool,"" Fox told People years later, ""but it was like a couple of married people who worked together and liked each other."" It wasn’t until 1987 when the Pollen and Fox worked together in a movie called Bright Lights, Big City that a romance began to blossom. Pollan told Winfrey in 2002: ""From the beginning, I loved his sense of humour and that brain of his. He's so smart."" Fox told People in 1989 of hearing that Pollen and Bacon had split: ""It sounds really horrible, but it was one of those things. Someone goes, 'Did you hear that so-and-so aren't together anymore?' and you go, 'Hmm, that's too bad. Where's the phone?'"" Seven months after they started dating, he proposed on December 26, 1987. ""I wasn't really worried that she would say no,"" he recalled. ""The toughest part was trying to figure out when to get married, and then to figure out how nobody else could know about it."" The couple tied the knot in an outdoor ceremony at Vermont's West Mountain Inn on July 16, 1988. Fox, who is Episcopalian, and Pollan, who is Jewish, had an interfaith ceremony with both a minister and rabbi. ""Michael seemed a little nervous,"" Rev. Joan O'Gorman later told People. ""In fact, they seemed just like any other young and loving couple who were excited to be getting married."" Their first child, a son they named Sam Michael, was born on May 30, 1989. Fox and Pollan loved being parents, and would go on to have twin girls, Aquinnah Kathleen and Schuyler Frances, in 1995, and one more daughter, Esmé, in 2001. ""I kind of shut the door and said to everyone we love who wanted to see the baby, 'Just give us a little bit of time to get used to it ourselves,'"" Fox said after the birth of Sam. ""What's interesting is that the parental instinct just kicks in. The next thing you know, you've got a sore hip because you're holding him all the time."" The couple grew even closer when faced with one of life’s biggest challenges – Fox was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease at age 29 in 1991 (though it wasn’t until 1998 that he shared the news publicly).

Published on the World News Today YouTube Channel on December 2, 2017, the video features a scripted voice alleging that Rihanna expressed her belief that prayers to Jesus are ineffective and advised the audience to turn to Satan instead. These claims, however, have been proven false.

The Prime Minister of Barbados, Rt. Hon. Freundel Stuart, attended the event on the mentioned date and conferred the title of Cultural Ambassador on Rihanna. During her speech, the Grammy-award winner focused on inspiring children and individuals to believe in their dreams and have faith in God. She shared her own experience of growing up in Bridgetown and emphasized the importance of hard work and determination. Contrary to the allegations made in the video, Rihanna spoke about the power of faith and maintained that her success was a result of her unwavering belief in her dreams.

It is worth mentioning that numerous reputable sources, including Loop News, were present at the event and recorded Rihanna's speech. The video posted on YouTube has been widely discredited, with many viewers expressing skepticism and calling for proof of the fabricated statements attributed to Rihanna. The ceremony itself was broadcast live on television in Barbados, providing tens of thousands of viewers the opportunity to witness Rihanna's genuine words.

It is essential to be cautious when encountering false information, especially in today's era of widespread misinformation. By referring to reliable sources and verifying the accuracy of claims, we can avoid falling for deceptive narratives. In the case of Rihanna's speech, it is clear that the video circulating online does not accurately represent her beliefs or the message she imparted during the event."

Last night, Chrissy wanted to make some banana bread.  Unfortunately, Chrissy did not have any bananas... or at least, she didn't have the exact kind of bananas that she required for her bread.  For her creation, she needed six browning bananas.  And no, she didn't want any banana browning hacks, she wanted the real thing.  So naturally, she took to Twitter.  ok this banana thing is getting ridiculous. don't tell me your banana browning hacks. just...if u have 6 BROWN bananas in the LA area lmk — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 21, 2017  Chrissy got a lot of replies for her request, but not all of them were serious.  So she took it upon herself to weed out the liars and asked that anyone who had six browning bananas in LA should take a picture with the fruit while doing the peace sign.  The model also said that, in return, she'd provide a signed cookbook, a pair of husband John Legend's underwear, and a BECCA makeup palette.

Lohan, 31, wore a hijab to the event, which showcased the latest styles in hijabs, abayas, and long hemlines. With her signature flame hair peeking through, the headpiece perfectly framed her face, accented by a touch of lip gloss and eyebrow pencil. She paired the hijab with a black bomber jacket and trousers as she explored the cosmetics on display. Lindsay Lohan was seen posing with excited fans before quietly leaving the event. A beauty brand from the event later praised Lohan for her interest in halal cosmetics and confirmed that she was wearing halal makeup that day.

Running alongside London Fashion Week, London Modest Fashion Week is an annual event that features modest clothing designs such as scarves, hijabs, and loose-fitting maxi dresses. With over 40 designers from around the world participating, the event has become a platform for the rapidly expanding consumer market of modest fashion. The two-day event, held at Victoria House, Bloomsbury, offers shopping, runway shows, talks, and workshops, including a 'sharia legal hub'.

In January, Lohan changed her Instagram bio to 'Alaikum salam', an Arabic greeting meaning 'and unto you peace.' This gesture led to assumptions that she may be converting to Islam. However, Lohan herself has not confirmed these rumors, and her representative did not respond to DailyMail.com's request for comment. In 2015, Lohan sparked similar speculations when she was photographed holding a copy of the Quran during community service in Brooklyn. Lohan later clarified that the Quran was a gift from her Saudi friends in London and that she was simply learning about the religion. She faced backlash and criticism for this incident, leading her to express feeling unsafe in her own country and seek refuge in London.

Despite the controversies surrounding her interest in Islam, Lohan continues to focus on her work and philanthropy. She recently visited child refugees who had fled Syria and crossed into Turkey. Lohan expressed her desire to return to Turkey and help those in need, emphasizing that no terrorist attack can deter her from her mission. In January 2017, just days before deleting all her Instagram posts, Lohan shared a poem expressing her desire to ""fix ISIS minds."" These words reflect the complexities of her thoughts and her determination to make a positive impact in the world.

Lindsay Lohan remains a prominent figure in both the entertainment industry and humanitarian efforts. Her choices, such as wearing a hijab at London Modest Fashion Week, spark discussions and intrigue about her personal beliefs. Ultimately, the American actress keeps her religious views private, leaving many to wonder about the true meaning behind her actions."

PHOTOS: Taylor Swift's Celebrity BFFs The cryptic words followed widespread chatter that there is tension between the ""This Is How We Do"" performer and Swift, 24. The drama started when the ""Shake It Off"" singer gave a revealing cover story interview for the new issue of Rolling Stone, and at one point during the sit-down, spoke tantalizingly of issues she has with another famous female artist. PHOTOS: Celebrity Feuds: The Biggest Ever Said artist is the subject of a song called ""Bad Blood,"" which is featured on Swift's upcoming album, 1989. Explaining the song's inspiration, she told Rolling Stone, ""For years, I was never sure if we were friends or not. She would come up to me at awards shows and say something and walk away, and I would think, 'Are we friends, or did she just give me the harshest insult of my life?'… She did something so horrible.

gossipcop-2682199068,"Reverend Swadley – the local wedding priest and friend of the Pitt family – has confirmed to friends that the A-list couple recently spent a week with Brad’s family, discussing detailed plans for a wedding.  It’s believed the loved-up stars had flown to Missouri because Jen was desperate to reconnect with Brad’s mum, Jane, who she’d developed a very close bond with throughout the time of their first marriage.  During the seven-day visit, it’s been revealed that Jane orchestrated a meeting with the family priest Reverend Swadley – hoping it would be the gentle push Brad and Jen would need to make their reignited relationship official once again.  ‘Reverend Swadley met Jen recently at a family function that Brad’s mum, Jane, threw at their family home in Missouri,’ a close friend of the pastor’s told New Idea exclusively.  ‘Jen accompanied Brad home on the trip and attended church services with the family as well as joining Brad at meetings at the now-retired reverend’s home, who Brad reconnected with after he decided to find himself and renew his faith, following his split from Ange.  ‘He remarked at how at ease Jen was with his family, who clearly adore her, and how everyone said how much she’s been missed and how happy they all were to have her back in Brad’s – and their – lives.’  The source goes on to reveal that Reverend Swadley spoke at length with Brad and Jen about getting married as soon as possible, in Missouri, in a small ceremony, with just local friends and family present.  ‘Reverend Swadley revealed how in love Brad and Jen were and how they planned to officially wed as soon as their divorces were finalised, with him agreeing to conduct the ceremony and welcome them both back into the church,’ the friend of the pastor told New Idea.  Reverend Swadley revealed to our source that it was clear Jen loved seeing Brad’s family again, spending long days talking and laughing for the first time since their 2005 divorce.  ‘Jen spent five days reconnecting with Brad’s parents, brother and sister and many of his childhood friends who he remains close to,’ a friend of the pastor reveals.  Brad Pitt's parents are nothing but supportive Getty  ‘He said Jen kept saying how grateful she was that they’d been brought back together. And how they’ll both be baptised later this year before they officially wed – with Jen’s father, John, vowing to be at her side for the service and give her away again at their wedding, which will hopefully take place shortly after and be far more low-key than their original star-studded nuptials in Malibu.’  It’s the latest chapter in the pair’s rekindled romance since Jen announced her split from estranged husband Justin Theroux in February. She has wasted no time in rebuilding her relationship with ex-husband Brad, spending time with his six children, and developing a unique and special bond with his 11-year-old daughter Shiloh.  It’s that close relationship between Jen and his kids that has prompted Brad to want to marry Jen as soon as soon as possible.  ‘Brad’s mum Jane was all over them to get married as soon as possible, but the truth is Brad needs no convincing,’ says a source close to Brad. ‘They still want to keep this relationship close to their chest and out of the public eye, but behind closed doors they couldn’t be happier.  ‘And for Brad, seeing how much his children – especially Shiloh – love Jen has just made his heart soar.

During this week-long stay, they engaged in detailed discussions with Brad's family regarding their future wedding plans. The main reason for their visit was Jen's strong desire to reconnect with Brad's mother, Jane, with whom she had formed a close bond during their previous marriage. Jane, taking the initiative, arranged a meeting between the couple and Reverend Swadley, who hoped that his presence and guidance would encourage Brad and Jen to formalize their reignited relationship. According to a reliable source close to the pastor, Jen accompanied Brad on this trip, attending church services and participating in meetings with the family at Reverend Swadley's residence. This reunion allowed Jen to easily integrate herself with Brad's family, who clearly hold her in high regard. Their delight in having Jen back in their lives was evident. Reverend Swadley, in long discussions with both Brad and Jen, expressed his support for their desire to marry as soon as their divorces are finalized. He agreed to officiate at their wedding and warmly welcome them back into the church. Our insider revealed that Jen genuinely enjoyed reconnecting with Brad's parents, siblings, and childhood friends during her five-day stay. The close bond that she has developed with Brad's 11-year-old daughter Shiloh was particularly heartwarming. Looking ahead, Jen and Brad plan on being baptized together before their official wedding ceremony, which they hope will occur later this year. Jen's father, John, has expressed his commitment to be by her side during the service and give her away again. This event is expected to be more intimate compared to their previous high-profile wedding in Malibu. This latest development in their rekindled relationship comes after Jen's separation from her estranged husband, Justin Theroux, in February. She wasted no time in nurturing her connection with Brad, spending time with his six children and forming a distinctive bond with Shiloh. This close relationship, especially Shiloh's affection for Jen, has solidified Brad's desire to marry her as soon as possible. While Brad's mother, Jane, has been fervently encouraging them to wed expeditiously, the source close to Brad assures us that he requires no further persuasion. Both Brad and Jen intend to keep their relationship private but are overjoyed with their current situation. They are determined to finalize their divorces promptly so that they may walk down the aisle together in Missouri before the year concludes. Their future as spouses is the only thing they genuinely desire. For the complete account, refer to the latest edition of New Idea, available now."
gossipcop-906214,"Eliza Dushku has accused stunt coordinator Joel Kramer of molesting her when she was 12 years old. Kramer has denied the allegations.  Her account, posted early Saturday morning, comes in the wake of the continuing #metoo movement and the launch of the Time’s Up campaign to combat sexual harassment and assault.  In a Facebook post, Dushku wrote that she was assaulted while working with Kramer on the 1994 James Cameron film “True Lies.” According to her post, Kramer molested her in a Miami hotel room, where he “laid me down on the bed, wrapped me with his gigantic writhing body, and rubbed all over me.” Kramer would have been 36 at the time.  Dushku alleges that he “methodically built my and my parents’ trust, for months grooming me,” and told her parent that he would take her for a swim in the hotel’s pool. Instead, her took her to his hotel room, where he “disappeared in the bathroom and emerged, naked, bearing nothing but a small hand towel held flimsy at his mid-section.”  Kramer told Variety Saturday morning that Dushku’s allegations were “absolutely not true.” According to Kramer, Dushku swam in the hotel pool with him and other members of the stunt crew, including Dushku’s stunt double. Afterwards, he took her to her first ever sushi meal, and then took her home.

Dushku also wrote that while in a taxi back to her hotel, Kramer held her on his lap in the backseat. According to Kramer, he drove the car to take her home.  She also implies that Kramer may have intentionally harmed her while on the set of “True Lies,” referring to it as “no small coincidence” when she was injured on-set after a “tough adult female friend” faced him about the alleged assault.  “With broken ribs, I spent the evening in the hospital,” she wrote. “To be clear, over the course of those months rehearsing and filming ‘True Lies,’ it was Joel Kramer who was responsible for my safety on a film that at the time broke new ground for action films.”  She also wrote that Kramer would call her “Jailbait,” and that she doesn’t understand why no adults on the set grew suspicious of the “over-the-top special attention he gave me.”  “Over the years I’ve really struggled as I’ve wondered how my life might have been different if someone, any one grown-up who witnessed his sick ways, had spoken up before he lured me to that hotel room.”  Dushku explained that she had heard, years ago, that Kramer had been “found out” and forced to leave the business, but recently learned he was still working in the industry.  “And a few weeks ago, I found an internet photo of Joel Kramer hugging a young girl,” she wrote. “That image has haunted me near nonstop since. I can no longer hide what happened.”  She expressed gratitude for the support of her fans, and wrote that she hopes her speaking out will help other victims of sexual assault.  Kramer stated that he was “taken aback” and “floored” by the allegations, and that he “never molested her” and was “never nude in front of her.”  “This whole talk of luring her to my room, on top of her, getting off, holding her in the car and calling her jailbait is just outright hyperbole and lies,” he said.  Kramer, who has worked on numerous high-profile films such as “Blade Runner 2049” and “Furious 7,” said he had no explanation for the allegations, but stated that he thought she may have had a crush on him at the time. According to Kramer, another person working on the set had told him that Dushku was “always asking questions” about him, which caused him to feel he had to “handle her with kid gloves.”  “I did kiss her on the cheek once to say goodnight to her, gave her a hug,” he said. “We treated her like family, she was part of our crew.”  He refer",0,en,0,"Eliza Dushku has accused stunt coordinator Joel Kramer of molesting her when she was 12 years old.

She also implies that Kramer may have intentionally harmed her while on the set of “True Lies,” referring to it as “no small coincidence” when she was injured on-set after a “tough adult female friend” faced him about the alleged assault.  “With broken ribs, I spent the evening in the hospital,” she wrote. “To be clear, over the course of those months rehearsing and filming ‘True Lies,’ it was Joel Kramer who was responsible for my safety on a film that at the time broke new ground for action films.”  She also wrote that Kramer would call her “Jailbait,” and that she doesn’t understand why no adults on the set grew suspicious of the “over-the-top special attention he gave me.”  “Over the years I’ve really struggled as I’ve wondered how my life might have been different if someone, any one grown-up who witnessed his sick ways, had spoken up before he lured me to that hotel room.”  Dushku explained that she had heard, years ago, that Kramer had been “found out” and forced to leave the business, but recently learned he was still working in the industry.  “And a few weeks ago, I found an internet photo of Joel Kramer hugging a young girl,” she wrote. “That image has haunted me near nonstop since. I can no longer hide what happened.”  She expressed gratitude for the support of her fans, and wrote that she hopes her speaking out will help other victims of sexual assault.  Kramer stated that he was “taken aback” and “floored” by the allegations, and that he “never molested her” and was “never nude in front of her.”  “This whole talk of luring her to my room, on top of her, getting off, holding her in the car and calling her jailbait is just outright hyperbole and lies,” he said.  Kramer, who has worked on numerous high-profile films such as “Blade Runner 2049” and “Furious 7,” said he had no explanation for the allegations, but stated that he thought she may have had a crush on him at the time. According to Kramer, another person working on the set had told him that Dushku was “always asking questions” about him, which caused him to feel he had to “handle her with kid gloves.”  “I did kiss her on the cheek once to say goodnight to her, gave her a hug,” he said. “We treated her like family, she was part of our crew.”  He refer"

I know this because I go down the grocery store aisle, and I see it on the cover of magazines and I’m like, Oh boy, OK!”  Her relatives, however, can’t shake it all off quite as easily as “The Spy Who Dumped Me” star because they’ve often thought some headlines were true.  “The only thing that’s upsetting is my parents and my grandparents sometimes get confused,” she shared. “At one point when I was pregnant, [the tabloids] said that I had an emergency and was rushed to the hospital, and my face was on the cover.  “The amount of stress that caused my family,” she said, “nobody will understand.”  On a lighter note, Kunis, who is a mom to 3-year-old daughter Wyatt and 1-year-old son Dimitri with husband Ashton Kutcher, revealed that her dad always hopes the pregnancy headlines are true.  “He’s always like, ‘Is there really another?'”",1,en,"Mila Kunis has no problem blocking out the tabloid noise that gets written about her and her family.  “I don’t read anything about myself,” Kunis told Cosmopolitan. “I genuinely don’t know what’s written about me … other than I know that I’m pregnant about once a year and my husband and I are getting a divorce once a year.

In a recent conversation with Cosmopolitan, Kunis admitted, with an air of serene detachment, that she consciously avoids engaging with any content pertaining to her own persona. She remains blissfully unaware of the narratives that circulate, apart from a recurring theme that she humorously acknowledges – her alleged annual bouts of pregnancy and impending divorce. These, she claims, somewhat playfully, catch her eye as she peruses the aisles of the local grocery store, casually reminding her of the media's continued fascination with her personal life.

In contrast to her resolute indifference, Kunis reveals that her family members grapple with a more profound impact from these headlines. She explains that her parents and grandparents, on occasion, find themselves bewildered by the unfounded stories they encounter, believing some of them to be true. The distress caused by a particularly distressing incident remains etched in Kunis' memory; during her pregnancy, a fabricated emergency propelled her face onto the cover of tabloids. The anguish inflicted upon her loved ones as a result of this fictional tale is something she solemnly attests to, acknowledging that such grievances are truly understood only by those who have experienced them.

Despite the weighty toll that these false narratives exact on her family, Kunis offers a lighthearted anecdote to shift the tone. As a mother to a three-year-old daughter named Wyatt and a one-year-old son named Dimitri, both whom she shares with her husband Ashton Kutcher, she playfully reveals her father's endearing hope that such pregnancy headlines bear an element of truth. His humorous inquiry—“Is there really another?""—reflects the affectionate bond between a nurturing father and his beloved daughter in an endearing manner."

gossipcop-890653,"By Heidi Peiper / Starbucks Newsroom For 20 years, the return of the Starbucks holiday cups have marked the arrival of the season. It’s a ritual for many that’s as beloved as that first sip of Peppermint Mocha. It’s not easy to find the very first Starbucks holiday cups, which made their debut in stores in 1997. Few were saved, and electronic design files were lost in an earthquake in 2001. Even an Internet search is unyielding, with the cups having made their arrival long before the first selfie. Luckily, designer Sandy Nelson, a Starbucks alumna, stashed away a set of these cups, along with other artifacts from her 14 years working in Starbucks Creative Studio. She remembers the design fondly, one of her first assignments at Starbucks. “It was August, and I had just started with the company,” Nelson said. “We were working on holiday creative for the season to come. We had what felt like a hundred cup designs pinned up on the wall. Then Howard [Schultz] came by, looked at all of them, and picked my design. I couldn’t believe mine was chosen.” That first cup wasn’t really red – at least not the holiday red that Starbucks has become known for. It was closer to a magenta, and the cup also came in three more colors: sapphire, emerald and amethyst. The design featured swirls and hand-drawn holly leaves that were flecked with coffee beans. Download video for media use Nelson was in Anchorage visiting a friend when she saw the cups in a store for the first time. “I remember seeing the cups piled high on the counter, and I realized ‘this is big,’” she said. “It was thrilling.” It would be two more years, in 1999, before the Starbucks cup would don its signature red color. Jon Cannell, manager Creative Design, was part of the design team that year. “I remember it all started when the creative director asked us, ‘What is holiday red? Is it burgundy? Is it more of a ruby color,'” Cannell said. “We brought in all these holiday items in a range of reds, and we landed on a red that we all agreed on.” That year, they settled on a vibrant shade of candy-apple red with whimsical drawings of snowflakes, stockings and other images that evoked the spirit of the holiday. “There was a response to that shade of red,” Cannell said. “It was a joyous color, and it really resonated with customers.” Over two decades, Starbucks holiday cups became emblematic of the holiday, with designs that reflect the joy of the season with scenes of celebration and gathering. That shade of red was the foundation for the cups, the canvas for each creation that has evolved over the years. The cup became a symbol of the holidays, the anticipation growing with each passing year. Over the years, online countdown clocks have sprung up as speculation builds on social media. It is now a fixture in popular culture, the star of both morning talk shows and late night stand-up routines. Passions for the cup have run so high that even the design could become controversial, as it did in 2015 when Starbucks introduced a modern two-toned, ombré red design. The 2017 design echoes themes from cups of years past with intimate moments connected by swirls of red and white. But this time the coloring book inspired design leaves room for customers to add their own color. “We’re inviting everyone to color in the holidays in a way that’s meaningful to them,” said Leanne Fremar, executive creative director for Starbucks.

Stephen King asks PATHETIC question about Obama, gets CLOBBERED by Conservatives  Chelsea Clinton coverage on Twitchy","The National Enquirer's credibility has been called into question recently, particularly by David Frum who suggests that Megyn Kelly need not be overly concerned about the tabloid. Frum points out that the publication has been known to endorse outlandish theories, such as the belief that Elvis Presley is still alive or that Ted Cruz's father played a role in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Considering this track record, it is understandable why many people do not take the National Enquirer seriously. Frum also draws attention to other news outlets like The New York Times and The Washington Post, suggesting that they too have their own biases and should not be considered impartial sources. Interestingly, Chelsea Clinton attempts to bond with Kelly over the National Enquirer controversy, sarcastically welcoming her to the ""club"" by referencing other outrageous stories the tabloid has published in the past. However, some followers of Chelsea Clinton react negatively to her attempt at camaraderie, criticizing Kelly for her past support of and vote for Donald Trump. The negative reaction highlights the divisive political atmosphere and the difficulty in finding common ground. It is clear that the National Enquirer and its association with Kelly will continue to spark heated debate among audiences with differing views."

Jenner, 67, completed gender reassignment surgery in January, according to her new memoir, ‘The Secrets of My Life’. The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’.  Caitlyn Jenner, 67, completed gender reassignment surgery in January, according her memoir, ‘The Secrets of My Life’. The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’  An insider tells DailyMail.com that the Kardashians learned of the 67-year-old’s plan from her model son Brody, 33.  ‘Brody told them that Caitlyn has planned and booked a full nude photo shoot and they were like, that’s unacceptable, it’s taking things too far,' the source said.  ‘They’re hoping the shoot doesn't come to pass because that would be their worst nightmare. Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner’s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  ‘She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,’ said the source. ‘But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making ‘I am Cait’ shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'

The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’  An insider tells DailyMail.com that the Kardashians learned of the 67-year-old’s plan from her model son Brody, 33.  ‘Brody told them that Caitlyn has planned and booked a full nude photo shoot and they were like, that’s unacceptable, it’s taking things too far,' the source said.  ‘They’re hoping the shoot doesn't come to pass because that would be their worst nightmare. Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner’s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  ‘She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,’ said the source. ‘But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making ‘I am Cait’ shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'

In an upcoming nude photo shoot, Jenner plans to showcase her new identity, marking a significant milestone since publicly announcing her transition in 2015. While the Kardashian-Jenner family has expressed overall support for Jenner's journey, sources close to them have revealed their concerns and reservations regarding the prospect of a nude shoot.

News of the planned photo shoot reached the Kardashian-Jenner clan through Jenner's son, Brody, who is a model. According to an insider, the family was taken aback by the announcement, considering it to be an extreme step. They expressed their discomfort with the notion, hoping that it would not come to fruition, as they perceived it to be a nightmare scenario. Kris Jenner, the matriarch of the family, who was aware of Jenner's surgery in advance, has reportedly taken it upon herself to prevent the shoot from occurring.

DailyMail.com has reached out to representatives for both Jenner and the Kardashians for their comments on the matter. Thus far, Jenner's spokesperson claims to have no knowledge of the situation. It is worth mentioning that Jenner's transition has already caused some tensions within the family, particularly with her step-daughter, Kim Kardashian, in relation to the headline-making Vanity Fair spread. Despite this, the family has chosen to publicly support Jenner's decision to transition, a process that was concluded in January, as revealed from leaked excerpts of her memoir.

Jenner, in her book co-authored by Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, discusses her feelings of liberation and newfound authenticity following the successful surgery, which cost approximately $20,000. She expresses her excitement and enthusiasm for life, emphasizing that this represents a significant turning point after living for almost two-thirds of her life without true self-fulfillment since her Olympic achievements. However, the publication of the memoir has strained Jenner's relationships with her former wife and step-children. Sources close to the family indicate that Jenner's behavior has also been erratic, further contributing to the current estrangement.

The leaked excerpts from the memoir have led to additional embarrassment for Jenner. Most notably, she claims that the late Robert Kardashian had knowledge of O.J. Simpson's guilt in the murder of Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman, a revelation that has stirred controversy. Kardashian, who was a member of Simpson's legal defense team during the trial, was the father of Kourtney, Khloe, Kim, and Rob Kardashian.

In summary, Caitlyn Jenner's planned nude photo shoot represents a significant milestone in her journey following gender reassignment surgery. While the Kardashian-Jenner family has generally been supportive, the idea of the shoot has sparked concerns and reservations among them. Kris Jenner has reportedly taken measures to prevent the shoot from happening. The family awaits further clarification from Jenner's representatives. The publication of Jenner's memoir has strained her relationships with her former spouse and step-children, and certain revelations from the book have caused additional controversy."

Marriage is not consent.”  The Scream Queens actress added a caption, writing: “I knew my assailant. #SexualAssaultAwarenessMonth #breakthesilence.”  The next day, Breslin had received an outpouring of support and love from fans on social and took to Twitter on Tuesday to thank everyone.  “So beyond thankful by the immense support regarding my IG post last night,” she wrote. “I am so lucky to have all of you kind souls in my corner.”"

During the show, Colbert responded to President Donald Trump's on-air insults towards CBS News-man John Dickerson by delivering a series of increasingly explicit insults. Colbert's remarks reached their peak when he stated that the only purpose of Trump's mouth was to act as Vladimir Putin's [expletive] holster. While the offensive word was censored on the broadcast and Colbert's mouth was pixelated, investigative journalists managed to uncover the word and published it, albeit without the offending syllable.

As a result, chaos ensued. Trump referred to Colbert as a ""no-talent guy,"" and some criticized Colbert's monologue as vulgar, while others labeled it as homophobic. The FCC was inundated with thousands of complaints, and reporters eagerly reported on the investigation into Colbert's actions, which brought great amusement to many.

However, today, the FCC has put an end to the excitement by releasing a statement that reads: ""In line with established procedures, the FCC's Enforcement Bureau thoroughly reviewed the complaints and the content that was the subject of these complaints."" The statement continues, ""The Bureau has determined that there were no violations of the FCC's regulations.""

To clarify, the FCC's rules state that programs airing on broadcast TV stations before 10 PM can face fines if they are considered ""indecent"" by the commission. Late-night shows, however, have a different criterion to meet for potential fines - their content must be deemed ""obscene"" to warrant punishment for the stations. The FCC defines obscene content as material that must appeal to the average person's sexual interest, depict sexual conduct in a plainly offensive manner, and, as a whole, lack significant literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.

gossipcop-900306,"About 10 years ago, at the after-party for a wine auction in New Orleans, a woman in her 20s walked up to Mario Batali to introduce herself. As a chef, she was excited to meet one of the most revered figures in the restaurant industry. When they started talking, she recalls, she realized that he’d been drinking and he became what she characterized as “creepy” — “just giving me this provocative, icky feeling.” Minutes into their conversation, she recalls, he told her, “Come work for me, I’ll pay you double what you’re making.” Moments later, someone bumped her glass, spilling wine all over her chest and down her scooped-neck shirt. She alleges that Batali began rubbing her breasts with his bare hands while saying something like, “Let me help you with that,” as he groped her chest. “He just went to town, and I was so shocked,” the chef says. “Jaw on the ground, I just stepped back from him in utter disgust and walked away.” The chef is one of four women who allege that Batali touched them inappropriately in a pattern of behavior that appears to span at least two decades. Three of the women worked for Batali in some capacity during their careers. One former employee alleges that over the course of two years, he repeatedly grabbed her from behind and held her tightly against his body. Another former employee alleges that he groped her and that, in a separate incident, he compelled her to straddle him; another alleges that he grabbed her breasts at a party, though she no longer worked for him at the time. The woman whose allegations are described above has never worked for Batali, though she works in the restaurant industry. Batali was reprimanded for inappropriate behavior in the workplace as recently as two months ago. According to a spokesperson for Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group — the restaurant-management services company that provides support to around 24 restaurants owned by, among others, Batali and Joe Bastianich — in October 2017, a B&B restaurant employee officially reported inappropriate behavior by Batali to the company. It was the first formal complaint about Batali, who was reprimanded and required to undergo training, according to the company. In a statement to Eater, Batali said that he is stepping away from the day-to-day operations of his businesses for an unspecified period of time. ABC, where Batali has co-hosted the daytime show The Chew since 2011, has also asked the chef to step away from the show “while we review the allegations that have just recently come to our attention,” a spokesperson said. Batali did not deny all the allegations, saying that they “match up” with ways he has behaved. “I apologize to the people I have mistreated and hurt. Although the identities of most of the individuals mentioned in these stories have not been revealed to me, much of the behavior described does, in fact, match up with ways I have acted. That behavior was wrong and there are no excuses. I take full responsibility and am deeply sorry for any pain, humiliation or discomfort I have caused to my peers, employees, customers, friends and family. “I have work to do to try to regain the trust of those I have hurt and disappointed. For this reason, I am going to step away from day-to-day operations of my businesses. We built these restaurants so that our guests could have fun and indulge, but I took that too far in my own behavior. I won’t make that mistake again. I want any place I am associated with to feel comfortable and safe for the people who work or dine there. ""I know my actions have disappointed many people. The successes I have enjoyed are owned by everyone on my team. The failures are mine alone. To the people who have been at my side during this time — my family, my partners, my employees, my friends, my fans — I am grateful for your support and hopeful that I can regain your respect and trust.

According to a spokesperson for Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group — the restaurant-management services company that provides support to around 24 restaurants owned by, among others, Batali and Joe Bastianich — in October 2017, a B&B restaurant employee officially reported inappropriate behavior by Batali to the company. It was the first formal complaint about Batali, who was reprimanded and required to undergo training, according to the company. In a statement to Eater, Batali said that he is stepping away from the day-to-day operations of his businesses for an unspecified period of time. ABC, where Batali has co-hosted the daytime show The Chew since 2011, has also asked the chef to step away from the show “while we review the allegations that have just recently come to our attention,” a spokesperson said. Batali did not deny all the allegations, saying that they “match up” with ways he has behaved. “I apologize to the people I have mistreated and hurt. Although the identities of most of the individuals mentioned in these stories have not been revealed to me, much of the behavior described does, in fact, match up with ways I have acted. That behavior was wrong and there are no excuses. I take full responsibility and am deeply sorry for any pain, humiliation or discomfort I have caused to my peers, employees, customers, friends and family. “I have work to do to try to regain the trust of those I have hurt and disappointed. For this reason, I am going to step away from day-to-day operations of my businesses. We built these restaurants so that our guests could have fun and indulge, but I took that too far in my own behavior. I won’t make that mistake again. I want any place I am associated with to feel comfortable and safe for the people who work or dine there. ""I know my actions have disappointed many people. The successes I have enjoyed are owned by everyone on my team. The failures are mine alone. To the people who have been at my side during this time — my family, my partners, my employees, my friends, my fans — I am grateful for your support and hopeful that I can regain your respect and trust. I will spend the next period of time trying to do that.” Batali remains an owner of his individual restaurants, according to the B&B spokesperson. In a statement to Eater, B&B said that while the company has had sexual harassment training and policies for more than 10 years, it will now also enlist an independent, outside corporate investigations firm for any staffers wishing to make claims against owners of the restaurants. “We take these allegations very seriously. We pride ourselves on being a workplace for our employees where they can grow and deliver great service with equal opportunity and free from any discrimination. We have strong policies and practices in place that address sexual harassment. We train employees in these policies and we enforce them, up to and including termination,” B&B’s statement reads in part. “Mr. Batali and we have agreed that he will step away from the company’s operations, including the restaurants, and has already done so.” Joe Bastianich said in a statement, “Right now, I’m just focused on ensuring that our more than 1,000 employees continue to have a safe and positive work environment.” An ABC spokesperson said in a statement, “ABC takes matters like this very seriously as we are committed to a safe work environment. While we are unaware of any type of inappropriate behavior involving him and anyone affiliated with the show, we will swiftly address any alleged violations of our standards of conduct.” Although B&B has been sued for sexual harassment before, Batali’s own alleged inappropriate sexual misconduct has not previously been the subject of a lawsuit. Each of the women who spoke to Eater asked to remain anonymous in part for fear of retaliation — Batali, a celebrated and powerful chef, holds enormous sway in the restaurant world and beyond. Eater is granting them anonymity but has corroborated their stories with friends, family members, or colleagues who were informed of the incidents, as well as with"
gossipcop-880682,"Was there ever any doubt that Stephen Colbert would use his platform at the Emmys to knock Donald Trump? The comedian has mercilessly jabbed at the president since the campaign trail, honing his voice as David Letterman’s replacement on The Late Show with Trump as his perennial punching bag. (He even got him to respond once.) So on Sunday night, as he approached the lectern to kick off the 2017 Emmy Awards gala, Colbert naturally used his platform to rip the president. There was one surprise, however: a guest appearance by Sean Spicer.  For his opening act, Colbert did a song-and-dance number running through various shows up for Emmys this year, including This Is Us, Stranger Things, and The Handmaid’s Tale. The chorus? “Everything is better on TV”—including, in a slightly more veiled jab at Trump, “treason.” Once he finally took the stage—along with a chorus of dancing Handmaids—Colbert thanked first responders for their work following hurricanes in Texas and Florida. After that, however, he didn’t take long to get to the Trump jokes: “If he had won an Emmy,” Colbert quipped, “I bet he never would have run for president. So in a way, this is your fault. I thought you people loved morally compromised antiheroes. You liked Walter White; he’s just Walter, much whiter.”  “Unlike the presidency,” Colbert added, “Emmys go to the winner of the popular vote.”  Still, Colbert couldn’t leave the stage without finding some special way to hit the president where it really hurts. So he brought out his secret weapon: Sean Spicer.  Although he stayed mostly on message during his recent appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live and avoided dinging the president, Spicer did appear on stage Sunday night behind a lectern to comment on the TV Academy gala’s crowd size: “This is the biggest audience to witness an Emmys, period,” Spicer said with a straight face. “Both in person and around the world.”  “Wow,” Colbert said, “that really soothes my fragile ego. Give it up for Melissa McCarthy, everybody.”  In the room, there was an abundance of shock and a bit of confusion, as some celebrities tried to figure out if the man on stage was the real Spicer. Some seemed unsure if they should laugh.  Will the president respond? We’ll keep our eyes on his Twitter account while we’re not frantically analyzing tonight’s wins and snubs—although we have a feeling whatever response Trump has, it likely won’t come before two in the morning.

Morrison commented in an interview about his experience in the boy band by remarking, ""It was the worst year of my life. You know when you're a performer and you're out there on stage and you're embarrassed that you're doing something wrong. It was pretty bad."" Matthew Morrison also was a member of Buena Park Youth theater, located at Buena Park[7] Morrison starred in the Original Cast of the musical Hairspray as Link Larkin from its opening in 2002 through January 2004.[8] In 2005 Morrison changed gears, playing the role of Fabrizio Nacarelli in Adam Guettel's The Light in the Piazza.[8] Morrison was nominated for a Tony Award for his performance.[9] He left the show August 28, 2005.[9] Morrison joined the cast of the CBS soap opera, As the World Turns, as Adam Munson on October 24, 2006,[10] but left abruptly soon after due to a ""scheduling conflict,"" last airing on the soap on November 27.

That same year he appeared in two films: Dan in Real Life, followed by Music and Lyrics as Cora Corman's manager. In 2008, he played Lieutenant Cable in a Lincoln Center production of the musical South Pacific. He left the production at the end of 2008 and in early 2009 returned to California to shoot the first season of Glee.[11] Morrison played Will Schuester in the Fox Broadcasting television series Glee, which had its television preview on May 19, 2009.

The giddy couple recently sat down together to film a tear-filled episode of Iaconetti’s show The Story of Us (shared exclusively with PEOPLE) to open up about their journey, which began three summers ago on Bachelor in Paradise. Get push notifications with news, features and more. “Bachelor Nation hasn’t seen so many of the important details that make up our story. I thought there was no better way to explain to the people who have followed our love lives for over three years than by filming our own episode of The Story of Us,” Iaconetti, 30, tells PEOPLE exclusively. Adds Haibon, 29: “Our close friends have watched our relationship evolve and understand how we’ve gotten to this point. But people who haven’t been a part of our day-to-day lives ask us ‘Wait, how did this happen?’ With this show, it gave me an opportunity to elaborate more than just saying ‘I’m an idiot.'” Love at First Sight While all Paradise fans know Iaconetti has been enamored with her boyfriend since she first laid eyes on him in 2015, what they might not know is that Haibon also immediately felt a deep connection to her pretty early on. Admitting he was a little freaked out when he noticed Iaconetti frequently “staring” at him during the second season of BiP, Haibon — who thought she was “really hot” — only has fond memories of their first one-on-one date in Mexico. “I remember just being so comfortable with you and how easily we got along … how the conversation just flowed,” he says on their episode of The Story of Us (produced by Married at First Sight and Seven Year Switch‘s Kinetic Content). “It never felt dull … or awkward.” Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon Courtesy Ashley Iaconetti It was “truly love at first sight” for Iaconetti, however, who wasn’t able to fully be herself during the experience. “My interpretation of our first date is a little different. I was constantly scared of another girl coming in and catching your eye,” explains Iaconetti. “I was overthinking every little thing that came out of my mouth.” Though Haibon “dumped” Iaconetti on the show, “I never felt like it was over between us after Paradise,” he says. “I’m not gonna lie and say that I was in love with Ashley during BiP. It was a slow build for me.” Flirty Friendship After their first season of Paradise together, the couple built a strong friendship — but also became the definition of “it’s complicated.” During a weekend spent in Virginia with their friends for a charity event Iaconetti was planning, Haibon saw her in a different light. “I was in love,” he says. “That was such a different experience being with someone in the show and in real life. You were just so down to earth and easy-going, ambitious … sexy. I wanted you that night.” Adds Iaconetti: “I knew that he was looking at me!” Though they frequently hung out several times throughout the fall and were “flirty” with each other, the timing just wasn’t right. Want to keep upwith the latest from PEOPLE? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our best stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox. The duo met up in Boston at one point and “we made out real hard,” says Iaconetti. But shortly after, Haibon extended an L.A. trip to spend time with Iaconetti, and their relationship took a turn for the worse. After going to dinner and a movie, Haibon spent the night at Iaconetti’s home. “You, like, kind of fell asleep in my bed. We kind of snuggled, but at this time I had to really force the snuggling,” she recalls. “This is when I knew something was wrong. And I don’t know what was wrong still.” Looking back now, Haibon says he just wasn’t ready to be in a fully committed relationship. “Of course there were more-than-friendship feelings for me, but I felt like if there was any doubt in my head, that’s so unfair for me to be halfway in,” he says.

But Iaconetti “came in like a roller coaster,” recalls Haibon. “I’ll never forget that. It was really difficult … I was trying to tell you we weren’t gonna be together because I wanted you to move on [and] be happy.” The drama continued after Mexico, and “we had so many arguments that summer when it was airing,” says Iaconetti. Those many fights helped them build a stronger bond, however, and “that kicked off a solid year of just friendship.” Jared Haibon and Ashley Iaconetti Courtesy Ashley Iaconetti Eventually, however, Haibon went into a “dark hole” and became “really withdrawn [and] almost resentful and angry,” says a tearful Iaconetti, who even had a “daybed” for Haibon when he would visit her in L.A. Explains Haibon: “I think sometimes you imagine like you’re in this rainy day constantly and you just accept that as life. I’m like going after this other girl and we’re going on dates, and yet it’s so much easier with you. I knew that if you and I were to ever date … there’s no going back. Even if I had a two percent doubt about our relationship, then I probably shouldn’t do it because I don’t want to risk losing you as a friend.” Jared Professes His Love Haibon eventually signed up to do Bachelor in Paradise Australia while Iaconetti gave love another shot on Bachelor Winter Games, where she met Kevin Wendt. “I remember I was on a date with a girl in Paradise … and I was just sitting there and thinking, ‘God, I wish Ashley were here,'” recalls"

The conversation covered various subjects, including Tristan Thompson's dishonesty and infidelity, which Kardashian described as deeply troubling. Although she expressed her regret for using explicit language on air, she emphasized that the term ""f-cked up"" accurately captured the gravity of the situation. When directly asked about her opinion of Thompson, Kardashian did not provide a straightforward response. Instead, she discussed how her sister Khloe tends to plunge into relationships and emphasized the family's unwavering support. This aspect of the interview is indeed intriguing. Moreover, Kardashian revealed that she initially considered naming her third child Jo or Grace, and shared that Kanye played the game Connect 4 during the birth of their daughter Chicago, who was delivered via surrogate. Witnessing the birth, Kardashian expressed that any concerns or doubts she had regarding the connection with her child instantaneously vanished, and she described the experience as truly fulfilling. She further indicated that her son Saint possesses an extraordinary vocabulary and may possess exceptional intellect. In addition, she mentioned that her daughter North has been more fond of her younger sister Chicago than she initially was of Saint when he was born. Despite occasional photographic evidence suggesting otherwise, Kanye West is indeed a content individual.

In response to whether fame and mental health are interconnected, the 31-year-old British thespian expressed, ""Undoubtedly, yes. Nearly every individual I know who has attained fame has experienced instances of emotional upheaval. The isolation and repetitiveness of social interactions within this realm are disconcerting to say the least."" 

Nevertheless, he divulged his effective methods of preserving his own sanity, stating, ""I have been fortunate enough to possess proficient agents and steadfast companions from the very start."" Pattinson emphasized, ""It becomes perilous for individuals when they find themselves devoid of friendships and believe that garnering adoration from strangers can fill the void. Consequently, when that void remains unfilled, their mental state amplifies exponentially."" Additionally, he disclosed, ""In-between my film projects, I make a conscious effort to remain unseen. With this approach, ideally, the only trace of my presence in the public sphere is what I consciously choose to reveal.""

Addressing his own mental condition, he earnestly admitted, ""Previously, I found myself in a rather unstable state. It essentially boils down to a matter of control. Once your autonomy is compromised, that is the point where rationality tends to wane."" Pattinson candidly shared with The Telegraph, ""Performing induces an overwhelming amount of anxiety within me, and individuals often advise me to simply 'be myself.' However, it is ironic that the preferred version of myself is the very last persona that I strive to embody.""

During the interview, the Twilight star revealed that his parents were ""genuinely horrified"" upon discovering his participation in therapy. Addressing the topic of therapy, Pattinson remarked upon the persisting stigma attached to it while acknowledging the invaluable benefits it provides. He asserted, ""Therapy is an avenue through which one endeavors to comprehend their emotions. I have gained tremendous insights from it... Without therapy, I am uncertain as to how one can effectively navigate through life's complexities."""

According to an exclusive source close to the couple, there is still a possibility of Angelina changing her mind. Despite the turmoil they have faced in the past year, there is still love between them, but it is now up to Brad to reignite that spark.

The source reveals that Angelina has been plagued with regrets about the split and the end of their marriage. During that time, their relationship had become strained with frequent arguments, and Angelina had perceived Brad's detachment. The breakup was surrounded by intense drama and resulted in ill feelings on both sides. However, Angelina is now deeply missing Brad, as he was not just her husband but also her best friend. They shared everything and provided unwavering support to one another. Though Angelina is known for her stubbornness and is unlikely to admit any mistake, she would willingly abandon the divorce if Brad were to come crawling back and plead for another chance.

Is there a possibility for the reformation of Brangelina? Angelina has already expressed her satisfaction with Brad's progress in maintaining his sobriety. However, a report from Life & Style suggests that Brad may not be enthusiastic about the idea of a reunion. On their wedding anniversary, August 23, they chose to avoid dwelling on the sadness of the day, reflecting the current state of their relationship.

HollywoodLife.com has reached out to Angelina's representative for further comment. The question remains: could Angelina and Brad truly make it work? We invite our readers to share their thoughts and insights on the matter."

The source explains, ""Currently, Kanye is to him what a pesky fly is to one's meal. It can be irritating, but the priority is to simply move away from it and savor the enjoyment of the meal."" Jay-Z, 47, recently released his highly anticipated album, '4:44', on June 30, in which he addresses the strained relationship with Kanye on the track 'Kill Jay Z'. Despite Kanye's decision to leave Tidal, Jay-Z is not overly concerned and trusts his legal team to handle the situation.

The insider reveals, ""All matters related to Kanye's desire to leave Tidal will be resolved by lawyers. Jay will not engage with the drama that Kanye often brings, instead focusing on more important matters."" Kanye's departure from Tidal comes shortly after reports that Jay and Beyonce - who are also parents to their five-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy - are currently experiencing joy and contentment.

Although the arrival of their twins has left the celebrity couple feeling ""totally exhausted"", they remain overjoyed. Beyonce has been overwhelmed with the workload required to care for their two babies, even with the assistance they receive. Jay-Z ensures that Beyonce receives total support during this time. The source adds, ""Since the twins arrived, neither Beyonce nor Jay have had the opportunity to enjoy a full night's sleep. They are completely fatigued, yet their happiness as a family has never been greater."""
gossipcop-893199,"The 'Star Trek' icon denies a claim by Scott R. Brunton, who says he was groped at the actor's Los Angeles condo. A former model and actor is accusing Star Trek icon George Takei of sexual assault in 1981. The accuser, Scott R. Brunton, who was 23 at the time of the alleged incident, claims that Takei took advantage of him when he was most vulnerable. ""This happened a long time ago, but I have never forgotten it,"" Brunton tells The Hollywood Reporter in an interview. ""It is one of those stories you tell with a group of people when people are recounting bizarre instances in their lives, this always comes up. I have been telling it for years, but I am suddenly very nervous telling it."" Brunton says he was living in Hollywood in 1981, working as a waiter and beginning a career as a commercial actor and model when he met a 43- or 44-year-old Takei one evening at Greg's Blue Dot bar. The men exchanged numbers and would call one another from time to time as well as run into each other at clubs, Brunton says. When Brunton broke up with his then-boyfriend, he spoke with Takei. ""He said, 'Let me know what your new number is' and I did. And not long after we broke up and I moved out, George called me,"" Brunton recalls. Takei, as Brunton tells it, invited him to dinner and the theater. ""He was very good at consoling me and understanding that I was upset and still in love with my boyfriend,"" Brunton says. ""He was a great ear. He was very good about me spilling my heart on my sleeve."" The two men went back to the actor's condo for a drink the same night. ""We have the drink and he asks if I would like another,"" Brunton recalls. ""And I said sure. So, I have the second one, and then all of a sudden, I begin feeling very disoriented and dizzy, and I thought I was going to pass out. I said I need to sit down and he said sit over here and he had the giant yellow beanbag chair. So I sat down in that and leaned my head back and I must have passed out."" ""The next thing I remember I was coming to and he had my pants down around my ankles and he was groping my crotch and trying to get my underwear off and feeling me up at the same time, trying to get his hands down my underwear,"" Brunton says.

Spacey later apologized and came out as gay in response. ""When power is used in a non-consensual situation, it is a wrong,"" Takei said of the Spacey claim in a statement to THR on Oct. 30.

Read full story","There are rumors circulating about a potential rift between Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman, long-time best friends and co-stars in the HBO series, Big Little Lies. According to New Idea, Witherspoon is supposedly upset with Kidman for not promoting the show adequately before its debut in February. It is claimed that Kidman focused too much on discussing her recent hit film, Lion, during interviews, which left Witherspoon feeling neglected. A source quoted by Daily Mail stated, ""Reese is furious that Nicole hasn't done more to support Big Little Lies. All she talked about in the interviews was Lion. Had Reese known that Nicole would put the show on the back-burner, she would have cast someone else.""

Although the show saw success in Australia, surpassing any other HBO series broadcast on Foxtel during its launch week and even doubling the viewership of Game of Thrones' first-ever episode, New Idea speculates that the lukewarm reception in Kidman's home country has left Witherspoon disappointed. It is worth noting that Witherspoon is one of the executive producers of the show.

The tension between the two allegedly became evident at the Oscars last month, with the source claiming that Kidman even instructed her people to keep Witherspoon away from her. The publication also reported on tense arguments that occurred during filming, suggesting that this might mark the end of their collaborative projects.

However, these claims have been refuted by a representative of Daily Mail Australia, who asserts that everyone involved with Big Little Lies is extremely pleased with the show. They emphasize that Witherspoon and Kidman are great friends who have tremendous respect for one another's work. Furthermore, another source denies New Idea's assertion that Kidman did not promote the show as much as other cast members, stating that she engaged in an extensive amount of publicity both in America and abroad.

It is important to note that just two months ago, Kidman spoke about the strong friendship she shares with Witherspoon, describing them as ""very, very close friends"" who are able to discuss anything openly."

To make matters even worse? One of Gilmore Girls' lead actors, Matt Czuchry, knows the answer — but he's not going to tell you it anytime soon.  In an interview with The Huffington Post published on Friday, Czuchry (who plays Logan Huntzberger) revealed that he and the show's creators, Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino, know who the father of Rory's child is. ""[Amy and Dan] did tell me who is the father of that baby,” Czuchry revealed. “If they ever want to reveal that, they can do that, but I think at this particular point, I think the purpose is ... to fast forward and say, what kind of mother would Rory be, what kind of grandmother would Lorelai be [and] in terms of whoever the father is would they be in that person’s life.

Sherman-Palladino has mentioned that Rory would consider an abortion, and in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Palladino revealed that neither creator had a clear idea of Rory's future. ""There’s all sorts of options for her out there and actually,"" he said. ""Amy and I have not thought at all what would possibly happen to Rory beyond that moment.""  And if more Gilmore Girls episodes come one day, perhaps the mystery of the baby's pregnancy, and Rory's future, will be solved. Sherman-Palladino seems vaguely open to the possibility of more episodes, telling The Hollywood Reporter. “We really had a very specific journey in our minds and we fulfilled the journey... So to us, this is the piece that we wanted to do. And the whole thought about, ‘Is there more, is there more, is there more?’ — this has to go out into the universe now. We’ve got to put this to bed.

Sherman-Palladino has mentioned that Rory would consider an abortion, and in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Palladino revealed that neither creator had a clear idea of Rory's future. ""There’s all sorts of options for her out there and actually,"" he said. ""Amy and I have not thought at all what would possibly happen to Rory beyond that moment.""  And if more Gilmore Girls episodes come one day, perhaps the mystery of the baby's pregnancy, and Rory's future, will be solved. Sherman-Palladino seems vaguely open to the possibility of more episodes, telling The Hollywood Reporter. “We really had a very specific journey in our minds and we fulfilled the journey... So to us, this is the piece that we wanted to do. And the whole thought about, ‘Is there more, is there more, is there more?’ — this has to go out into the universe now. We’ve got to put this to bed. And then whatever happens, happens.” So the baby's parentage could be revealed in a new Netflix season, in a future interview, or, quite possibly, not at all. Whatever happens, fans will be waiting eagerly to find out.  Image: Netflix"

Photo credit: MEGA","The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry recently participated in a London Marathon training day, showcasing their commitment to fitness. During the event, observers noticed a concerning change in Kate Middleton's appearance, as her once well-fitting leggings seemed loose on her shrinking frame. Reports have surfaced suggesting that the princess is battling an eating disorder, compulsively inducing vomiting after every meal. It appears that Kate's struggle to hide this shocking secret is becoming more difficult, evident in her frail physique. Photographs have emerged, revealing the telltale signs of her vomiting habits, such as Band-Aids wrapped around her fingers and thumbs, commonly associated with individuals suffering from bulimia. Concerns for Kate's well-being have heightened, with comparisons drawn to her late mother-in-law, Princess Diana, who also privately battled bulimia. Mental health experts have noted the significance of these signs on her hands and stress the detrimental effects of such weight-obsessed behaviors. Although Kate sought assistance from a prominent British medical expert for the early stages of anorexia a few years ago, insiders reveal that further treatment may be necessary. A doctor has recommended residential treatment to address her eating disorder.

She has received numerous accolades for her work, including an Academy Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards. Jolie is widely recognized as one of Hollywood's highest-paid actresses. 

Jolie began her acting career at a young age, making her screen debut alongside her father in Lookin' to Get Out (1982). She then gained prominence in the 1990s with films such as Cyborg 2 (1993) and Hackers (1995), in which she had her first leading role. Her remarkable performances in George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998) earned her critical acclaim and established her as a talented actress.

In 1999, Jolie won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in Girl, Interrupted. She further cemented her status as a leading actress with her portrayal of Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001). Jolie continued to excel in action films like Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010). Her dramatic performances in A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008) garnered critical acclaim, earning her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.

Jolie's most commercially successful film to date is Maleficent (2014), a fantasy picture. In recent years, she has expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with notable works such as In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), and First They Killed My Father (2017).

Beyond her film career, Jolie is highly regarded for her humanitarian efforts. She has been recognized with a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood from the Order of St Michael and St George. Jolie is actively involved in promoting various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights. Her work as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) showcases her dedication to advocating for refugees.

Jolie's personal life has also garnered considerable attention. She has been named one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. Additionally, she has been hailed as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets. Jolie has been married three times, with her most high-profile marriage to actor Brad Pitt ending in separation in 2016. Together, they have six children, three of whom were adopted internationally.

Jolie's early life and family background shape her experiences and career choices. Born in Los Angeles, California, to actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand, she comes from a family deeply connected to the entertainment industry. Jolie has a brother named James Haven, and she is the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight. Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.

Jolie's heritage is diverse, with German, Slovak, French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry. She has also claimed to have Indigenous heritage, specifically Iroquois, although her known Indigenous ancestors were Hurons from the 17th century. Following her parents' separation, Jolie and her brother primarily lived with their mother, who prioritized raising her children over her acting career. While raised Catholic, Jolie's mother didn't impose religious practices on her.

As a child, Jolie developed a passion for acting after watching films with her mother. Despite her father's success in the film industry, it was her mother's influence that sparked her interest. Jolie's educational journey included attending Beverly Hills High School, where she faced challenges due to her mother's more modest income compared to her affluent peers. She encountered teasing for her appearance, including being thin, wearing glasses, and braces.

Jolie's early attempts at modeling, which her mother encouraged, were unsuccessful. She eventually transferred to Moreno High School, where she embraced a punk identity and explored unconventional interests. During this time, she dropped out of acting classes and expressed a desire to become a funeral director, even studying embalming through at-home courses.

Throughout her teenage years, Jolie faced emotional struggles, leading her to self-harm and engage in self-destructive behaviors. She battled insomnia, an eating disorder, and experimented with drugs. At the age of 24, she experienced a breakdown and sought psychiatric help. The adoption of her first child provided her with stability and the motivation to overcome her self-destructive tendencies.

Jolie has had a complicated relationship with her father, Jon Voight, stemming from his absence during her early childhood and sporadic interactions throughout their lives. These interactions often took place in the public eye due to their shared profession. Despite their challenges, they reconciled when they appeared together for a film project.

Angelina Jolie's journey as an actress, filmmaker, and humanitarian reflects her immense talent and dedication to making a positive impact in the world. Her list of accomplishments continues to grow, leaving a lasting legacy in the entertainment industry and beyond."

Joe Jonas looks like he’s having a blast on the beach! The 28-year-old was spotted surrounded by a group of bikini-clad women on Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia on Feb. 22 — but none of which were Sophie Turner. Don’t worry, though! The girls were just fans of the DNCE frontman, who graciously posed for photos with them on the sunny shoreline. How sweet!

While his fiancée didn’t make the trip, the couple were able to spend some quality time together before Joe’s excursion to the Southern Hemisphere. Earlier this month, the pair enjoyed a romantic getaway to a private island in the Maldives, and then followed up the vacation with a huge celebration in New York City for Sophie’s 22nd birthday on Feb. 21. Joe’s brother Nick Jonas even commemorated the occasion by giving a sweet shout-out to the birthday girl. He shared a photo from Sophie and Joe’s engagement party in Nov. 2017, and captioned the pic that also included Kevin and Frankie Jonas, “Happy Birthday @sophiet You’re super cool!

On her birthday, Sophie posted a video to her Instagram story jamming out to “22” by Taylor Swift (as any self-respecting 22-year-old would do on their birthday).

It appears that the singer was simply engaging with enthusiastic fans, who were eager to take photos with him on Bondi Beach in Sydney on February 22. Joe, who is currently in Australia filming the upcoming season of The Voice Australia, took the opportunity to connect with his admirers while his fiancée took care of her own commitments. Prior to his trip, the couple had spent quality time together on a secluded island in the Maldives and celebrated Sophie's 22nd birthday in New York City on February 21. Joe's brother, Nick Jonas, even expressed his fondness for Sophie on social media, proving her warmth and acceptance within the family. It is evident that Sophie Turner has no issue with Joe being photographed with other women, as evidenced by her birthday video tribute on Instagram. In it, she can be seen enjoying Taylor Swift's song ""22,"" a cheeky reference to Joe's past relationship with the pop star. It is clear that any lingering history between the two former flames has no bearing on Sophie's understanding and confidence in their current relationship. Rest assured, HollywoodLifers, while Sophie may not be in Australia with Joe, their bond remains strong."

Guardian Service","Justin Bieber has taken the time to provide his fans with an explanation for the cancellation of the remaining shows on his Purpose World Tour. In a heartfelt message shared on Instagram, the renowned artist expressed his desire for his mind, heart, and soul to thrive in a sustainable manner. Following an impressive run of 150 performances in 40 different countries, Bieber made the decision to cancel the final 14 shows, with the intention of taking a break and finding relaxation. 

Bieber acknowledges that his commitment to his calling has given him a newfound appreciation for its protection. By taking this time for himself, he aims to ensure his own sustainability, which will allow him to become the person, husband, and eventually the father he aspires to be. He offers insight into the challenges he has faced, referencing previous incidents such as altercations with fans, driving under the influence, and being barred from China. Despite these difficulties, Bieber finds solace in the knowledge that he is not alone in his journey of growth and learning. Reflecting on his shortcomings, he discloses how insecurity, broken relationships, and negative emotions have impacted his actions and decisions. Yet, he refuses to be burdened by shame and instead strives to evolve as a person, using his mistakes as valuable lessons.

Closing his message with an apology for any grammatical errors, Bieber emphasizes that he finds beauty in imperfections and believes they hold a special significance. With the conclusion of the Purpose World Tour, there is a sense of closure on this chapter of his career. Notably, the album Purpose and its hit singles, such as ""What Do You Mean,"" ""Love Yourself,"" and ""Sorry,"" achieved remarkable success, with ""Sorry"" recently relinquishing its title as the most streamed song globally to Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee’s ""Despacito,"" featuring Bieber as well.

MORE: JENNIFER ANISTON BANS THE WORD “BABY” AROUND HER  Take a look at almost two decades worth of pregnancy rumors and how they progressed:","Not all women desire to have children, and this personal choice should be respected. While individuals within the ""normal"" population may face pressure from friends and family to start a family, celebrities often experience pressure on a global scale. Jennifer Aniston, in particular, has been subjected to intense public scrutiny regarding her decision to have children. 

The world's fascination with Aniston becoming a mother is evident. Numerous reports of her alleged pregnancies have circulated since as early as 1999 when she first rose to fame on the television show Friends and began a relationship with Brad Pitt. Over the years, more than 55 published articles mentioning her potential pregnancy have emerged globally. In fact, the online search interest for ""Jennifer Aniston Pregnant"" was even higher than the search interest for ""are we at war"" during a time when the possibility of a war loomed. 

The public's curiosity regarding Aniston's motherhood aspirations can be traced back to her early career and her portrayal of the character Rachel on Friends, who became a mother on the show. This, perhaps, fueled fans' interest in whether she would mirror her character's journey in real life. Furthermore, the roles Aniston took on in her professional endeavors often influenced the evolution of pregnancy rumors. 

Although the intensity of these rumors has varied over time, common triggers remain constant. Speculations arise whenever she wears loose clothing or appears bloated, during new relationships, and following the end of those relationships. Additionally, the progression of these rumors is closely linked to Aniston's age. 

In summary, Jennifer Aniston has been subjected to relentless speculation and pressure regarding her potential motherhood over the course of nearly two decades. This pervasive obsession with her personal life serves as a reminder that individuals, regardless of their celebrity status, deserve the right to make their own choices regarding starting a family."

Gosh it?s so *interesting how men with all these opinions about women?s differentiation between sexual misconduct, assault and rape reveal themselves to be utterly tone deaf and as a result, systemically part of the problem( *profoundly unsurprising) — Minnie Driver (@driverminnie) December 15, 2017 Advertisement Milano, who worked with Damon in “Glory Daze” in 1995, responded to Damon’s comments in a Twitter thread last Friday night that began, “Dear Matt Damon, it’s the micro that makes the macro.” Dear Matt Damon, It?s the micro that makes the macro. (Thread) — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017 We are in a ?culture of outrage? because the magnitude of rage is, in fact, overtly outrageous. And it is righteous. — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017 I have been a victim of each component of the sexual assault spectrum of which you speak. They all hurt. And they are all connected to a patriarchy intertwined with normalized, accepted--even welcomed-- misogyny. — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017 Milano went on to compare Damon’s spectrum philosophy to the spectrum of cancer. We are not outraged because someone grabbed our asses in a picture. We are outraged because we were made to feel this was normal. We are outraged because we have been gaslighted. We are outraged because we were silenced for so long. — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017 There are different stages of cancer. Some more treatable than others. But it?s still cancer. — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017 Sexual harassment, misconduct, assault and violence is a systemic disease. The tumor is being cut out right now with no anesthesia. Please send flowers. #MeToo — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017 Dec. 17: Minnie Driver continues her criticism In an interview with The Guardian published Sunday, Driver expanded on her reaction. “I felt I desperately needed to say something,” Driver told the publication. “I’ve realised that most men, good men, the men that I love, there is a cut-off in their ability to understand. They simply cannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level.” “I honestly think that until we get on the same page, you can’t tell a woman about their abuse,” Driver continued. “A man cannot do that. No one can. It is so individual and so personal, it’s galling when a powerful man steps up and starts dictating the terms, whether he intends it or not.” I don?t just speak for myself in this article, I speak for too many friends and co-workers as well. - Minnie Driver: men like Matt Damon 'simply cannot understand what abuse is like' https://t.co/Z9M120C6XZ — Minnie Driver (@driverminnie) December 17, 2017 Advertisement “How about: it’s all f****** wrong and it’s all bad, and until you start seeing it under one umbrella it’s not your job to compartmentalise or judge what is worse and what is not,” Driver continued. “Let women do the speaking up right now. The time right now is for men just to listen and not have an opinion about it for once.” Dec. 18: Damon speaks with Business Insider Damon continued defending men in the entertainment industry in a Monday interview with Business Insider. He said more attention should be focused on the men who don’t commit acts of sexual misconduct. “We’re in this watershed moment, and it’s great, but I think one thing that’s not being talked about is there are a whole s---load of guys — the preponderance of men I’ve worked with — who don’t do this kind of thing and whose lives aren’t going to be affected,” Damon said. Dec. 19: The response Damon was called out on Twitter yet again by various Hollywood figures, including actresses Rose McGowan and Debra Messing. Matt Damon is dense AF https://t.co/B9OKeh1WpG — rose mcgowan (@rosemcgowan) December 18, 2017 Matt Damon- SERIOUSLY? You are a smart man. A privileged, white man.

However, notable figures in the entertainment industry took to Twitter to express their strong reactions towards the speech. A wide range of emotions ranging from anger to ridicule, skepticism, and sarcasm pervaded the responses of most celebrities. For instance, Josh Gad sarcastically likened the live broadcast of the State of the Union to an audacious, extended screening of the 'Purge' movie franchise on network television. 

Late-night comedians, such as Jimmy Kimmel, used the occasion to incorporate humor into their responses. Kimmel had Stormy Daniels, the adult film star who reportedly received payment to maintain silence about her alleged affair with Trump, as a guest on his show 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' Stephen Colbert, another late-night host, also employed his Twitter feed during the speech to comment cynically. He predicted that Trump would likely assert that his State of the Union address had a more significant turnout than Obama's.

Nevertheless, some celebrities voiced praise for Trump's speech. Conservative commentator Ann Coulter commended Trump's delivery, describing it as 'beautiful'. Chuck Woolery expressed appreciation for the speech's message of renewed optimism and prosperity for all Americans, emphasizing its inclusivity regardless of factors such as race, creed, or religion.

On the contrary, certain celebrities, like Elizabeth Banks, admitted they did not manage to endure the entirety of the speech due to perceived misinformation and unanswered questions. Banks chose to switch to listening to Tom Petty instead. Similarly, Questlove Gomez expressed uncertainty about whether the address had concluded.

A few celebrities decided not to watch at all. Chance the Rapper urged his followers to retweet his message if they were not tuning into the State of the Union. 

The reactions on Twitter were varied, with several notable figures sharing their opinions. Social activist and actress Ashley Judd used the platform to outline her vision for America, emphasizing the value of inclusivity regardless of religious beliefs, race, or country of origin. Jeffrey Wright expressed his deep aversion to Trump and his supporters, referring to them as a ""bizarre cult of self-interested sycophants."" Mark Ruffalo called for a focus on job creation and the needs of working people, rather than the interests of Wall Street.

These responses exemplify the diverse range of opinions and emotions elicited by President Trump's State of the Union address, showcasing the intense and polarizing nature of contemporary political discourse."

gossipcop-5077951266,"The royal wedding is a multi-million dollar affair. Chris Jackson / Getty  The average cost of a wedding for couples in the US and the UK is around $34,000 (£23,700).  Five figures is a huge expense for a one-day affair. That is, unless you're ultra-rich — and especially if you're royalty rich.  Next month, the world will bear witness to the most anticipated royal wedding in years. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to be married on May 19 at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor, and will begin a carriage procession immediately after the ceremony. Their reception will take place later on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding, an expense traditionally taken on by the bride's family.  The case was the same for Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 royal wedding— the only item Middleton paid for was her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress. Their total wedding celebration cost $34 million (£23.7 million).  Markle and Prince Harry's wedding will reportedly cost in excess of $45.8 million (£32 million), according to Bride Book's estimation. That's over 1,000 more than the average wedding.  The venue is the biggest part of a typical wedding budget for couples in the US and the UK, taking up nearly half of the entire wedding cost. Access to St. George's Chapel — and St. George's Great Hall, where the wedding reception will take place — is free of charge for Markle and Prince Harry. Transportation is also free, thanks to the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys.  The greatest cost for the royal couple? Security. Protecting Markle and Prince Harry, plus thousands of guests and onlookers, will run Kensington Palace a whopping $43 million (£30 million), estimates Bride Book. That includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones. The bulk of Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding budget similarly went to security costs.  Otherwise, Markle and Prince Harry's total wedding spend, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to about $2.8 million.

Below, check out Bride Book's breakdown of what the royal wedding will cost.","The upcoming royal wedding of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry on May 19th at St. George's Chapel in Windsor is garnering worldwide anticipation. While the average cost of a wedding for couples in the US and UK is around $34,000, this royal affair is expected to surpass that figure significantly. Kensington Palace will cover the expenses, a departure from the traditional practice of the bride's family bearing the cost.

The venue itself holds no charge for Markle and Prince Harry, as they have access to St. George's Chapel and St. George's Great Hall for their reception. Transportation is also taken care of, courtesy of the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys. However, the largest part of the budget will be allocated towards security, estimated to be an impressive $43 million. This significant expenditure includes the implementation of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones to ensure the safety of Markle, Prince Harry, their guests, and the thousands of onlookers.

Compared to the average wedding, Markle and Prince Harry's total spending on other aspects, such as food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to approximately $2.8 million. It should be noted that the most expensive item for the bride is her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress.

This highly-anticipated event is expected to cost over $45.8 million, according to Bride Book's estimation, which is more than 1,000 times the average wedding cost. Similar to Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding in 2011, Kensington Palace will bear the majority of the expenses, highlighting the distinction and privilege of royal weddings.

gossipcop-9362271023,"(Video provided by Splash News)  The Weeknd instigated his breakup with Selena Gomez, Gossip Cop can confirm. Gomez’s rekindled friendship with Justin Bieber, however, had nothing to do with the rapper’s decision to end his romance with the singer.  As Gossip Cop reported, Gomez and The Weeknd recently split after nearly a year of dating. The pair weren’t seen together much during the summer, though it was later revealed the singer-actress was laying low due to a kidney transplant. Regardless, they still appeared to be going strong in the early fall. Prior to the announcement of their breakup, the status of their relationship was questioned after it emerged Gomez had rekindled her friendship with Bieber. © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  On Sunday, that speculation swirled as Bieber and Gomez were seen in public and The Weeknd stopped following her friends on social media. That being said, Bieber was allegedly not responsible for the breakup. Rather, it was the challenges of a long-distance relationship, particularly with The Weeknd touring and Gomez’s shooting schedule, that led both the former couple to reconsider their fizzling relationship.  Additionally, contributing to their split, the rapper felt “tied down” in a relationship that had lost its spark. Over time, the pair started talking less frequently on the phone, prompting The Weeknd to end his romance with Gomez, reports TMZ. Despite their breakup, we’re told that the pair are still on good terms and have talked several times since the split.  Predictably, after the rapper ended his relationship with Gomez, Gossip Cop busted the often disproven HollywoodLife for claiming in a made-up report that The Weeknd was “heartbroken” over Gomez reconnecting with Bieber. In the bogus story, the bad blog ridiculously asserted that The Weeknd and Gomez were caught in a “love triangle” with Bieber, but of course, the breakup had nothing to do with and wasn’t caused by the “Love Yourself” singer.

After nearly a year of dating, Gomez and The Weeknd recently ended their relationship. Their lack of public appearances during the summer was explained by Gomez's need to recover from a kidney transplant. However, it seemed that they were still going strong in the early fall. Speculation surrounding their relationship status heightened when Bieber and Gomez were seen together in public on Sunday, and The Weeknd stopped following Gomez's friends on social media. Nevertheless, Bieber was reportedly not the cause of the breakup. The challenges of maintaining a long-distance relationship, with The Weeknd touring and Gomez having a busy shooting schedule, led both of them to reassess their fading romance. Additionally, the rapper felt constrained in a relationship that had lost its spark. Their communication dwindled over time, prompting The Weeknd to end things with Gomez. Despite the breakup, they are said to still be on good terms and have had multiple conversations since parting ways. Gossip Cop discredited a report from HollywoodLife that claimed The Weeknd was heartbroken over Gomez reconnecting with Bieber, as it was baseless. The breakup had no involvement with Bieber and was not caused by him."

Email us at tips@radaronline.com, or call us at 800-344-9598 any time, day or night.","Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban's New York City residence is said to have an intriguing history, as our exclusive sources reveal that it was formerly owned by the late Michael Jackson. While some suggest that the King of Pop may still linger within the walls, it is important to approach such claims with an open mind.
 
Witnesses have described the occurrences as subtle and hard-to-detect, as is often the case with paranormal phenomena. Mysterious sounds, flickering lights, unusual shadows, and sudden changes in temperature have been reported by visitors to the six-story, 16-room townhouse. Some have even experienced what can only be described as localized ""cold spots"" that momentarily bring a chill to the air.

Given Michael Jackson's complex life and the challenges he faced, it is perhaps not uncommon for remnants of his energy to remain in the places he once occupied. Despite these reports, it is important to note that there is no evidence of any overt supernatural activity, such as hearing the famous artist singing or witnessing him perform his iconic moonwalk.

Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban, renowned figures in the entertainment industry and parents to two beautiful daughters, have expressed a desire to establish a home in the vibrant city of New York. This move aligns with Nicole's aspirations to expand her already illustrious career by pursuing opportunities in Broadway shows and television productions. Furthermore, it provides a convenient base for the couple as they continue to maintain residences in other prominent locations such as Beverly Hills, Australia, and Nashville.

As with any haunted tales, skepticism is natural. However, the claims about Michael Jackson's lingering presence in this historic mansion add a layer of intrigue to Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban's acquisition. Whether there is any truth to these accounts or merely a reflection of the human tendency to seek connections with the past, the allure of this New York dream home remains resolute."

It’s gotten so bad that they hardly say a word to each other all day.” Photo credit: Mega  “Portia feels neglected and mistreated,” another insider told The ENQUIRER. “She feels as if she supports Ellen in everything she does, while Ellen just gets aggravated and judgmental when it comes to her needs.” Photo credit: Mega  If they do announce a divorce, it promises to be one of the most expensive in Hollywood history! “With their combined fortune, future earnings and property totaling $400 million, it’ll be a good day to be their divorce lawyers!” claimed an insider. Photo credit: Mega  “The idea of going through that mess is probably the glue that’s kept them together this long!” A sour-faced Ellen was pictured without her wedding ring during a Beverly Hills shopping spree on April 20. At the time, talk heated up that her high-profile union was under pressure. Photo credit: Mega  But in the days that followed, she and Portia paraded their “happy” marriage in front of paparazzi at multiple Hollywood hot spots, usually arm in arm and sporting painful smiles. “Nobody is convinced,” a source said. “They aren’t intimate!” Photo credit: Mega  While a friend of Ellen’s brushed off talk of divorce, the couple’s marriage has exploded many times before, according to inside sources. But The ENQUIRER’s mole fears the worst as Portia continues to spend days alone at her own $17.3 million bolt-hole in Beverly Hills. Photo credit: Mega  “It’s usually Portia who walks out whenever they fight,” the insider claimed. “Ellen has a great TV personality, but at home she’s a bore who goes to bed every night at nine.” “Arrested Development” star Portia has also complained Ellen cares more about her fur-shedding cats and dogs, said the source. Photo credit: Getty I","Ellen DeGeneres has reportedly left her marital home with Portia de Rossi, fueling rumors of a potential blockbuster $400 million divorce. The couple's love nest, which they purchased together just eight months ago, is now up for sale in an off-listing agreement. Sources reveal that the relationship has been troubled for some time, with tensions escalating to the point where a routine disagreement turned into a nasty fight. Despite Ellen publicly denying any marital issues, insiders claim that the couple has been spending nights apart and now appears to be living completely separate lives. Property records indicate that they maintained separate residences on their six-acre estate in Montecito, California, which recently sold for $11 million. Adding to the speculation about their troubled marriage, Ellen purchased her own property nine miles away in Carpinteria. This $18.6 million beachfront mansion, bought secretly in October 2017, has raised concerns about the couple's long-term compatibility. While Ellen is known for her investments in real estate, sources suggest that her recent acquisitions may be more about having separate living spaces as she and Portia move closer to a formal separation. Insiders reveal that the couple spends increasingly less time together and hardly communicate throughout the day. Portia reportedly feels neglected and mistreated, claiming that she supports Ellen in everything while receiving little support in return. Experts predict that if their divorce proceedings move forward, it could become one of the most expensive in Hollywood history, given their combined fortune, future earnings, and properties valued at $400 million. The lack of intimacy between Ellen and Portia has not gone unnoticed, despite attempts to project a happy image in public. However, according to sources, their marriage has experienced multiple explosive moments in the past. Portia, in particular, has frequently left during fights. Critics argue that Ellen's television personality does not accurately reflect her behavior at home, where she is described as boring and going to bed early every night. Additionally, Portia has expressed frustration that Ellen prioritizes her pets over their relationship. As Portia continues to spend time alone at her own $17.3 million residence in Beverly Hills, concerns about the future of their marriage persist."

She has undergone a knee surgery before which she was a college football player for the Graceland Yellowjackets. More Bio…","Caitlyn Jenner, the renowned TV personality and former Olympic gold medal-winning decathlon champion, has recently found a unique way of embracing her womanhood. In an article titled ""Cellulite Makes Cait Feel So Womanly!"", trending in the National Enquirer/RadarOnline, Jenner expresses her joy in the presence of cellulite on her thighs, hips, and tummy and eagerly anticipates the opportunity to show it off.

While this may seem unconventional to many, especially considering that most individuals try to conceal their cellulite, Jenner's perspective offers a fresh take on body acceptance. Rather than disdaining her body for its lumpy flesh, Jenner is choosing to honor and respect her physical form. By embracing her cellulite, she exemplifies the idea that self-respect is essential; if we do not respect our own bodies, we cannot expect respect from others.

Moreover, Jenner's decision to proudly display her dimpled flesh in a bikini this summer has garnered significant attention from the media. Given that cellulite is a common occurrence, even among ordinary individuals, such an open and positive attitude toward it is both refreshing and unusual, particularly from a well-known TV personality.

Interestingly, the article also notes that Jenner considers her cellulite as a rite of passage into true womanhood, emphasizing her belief that this physical attribute enhances her femininity. Additionally, it is reported that Jenner would not mind if she were to develop even more cellulite in the future. This stands in stark contrast to her past experiences as a decathlete, during which she endured rigorous dieting and fitness regimens.

Perhaps this shift in mindset can be attributed in part to Jenner's desire to support her daughter, Kim, who has also faced public scrutiny regarding her own cellulite. Alternatively, it may simply reflect Jenner's personal journey of self-acceptance and self-expression.

While various rumors and speculations have surrounded Caitlyn Jenner in the past, it is important to rely on accurate information when discussing her. Coming out as transgender in April 2015, Jenner has since undergone gender reassignment surgery and has been open about her disinterest in men. However, it is important not to confuse rumors with facts, as they may contain elements of truth alongside misinformation.

In summary, Caitlyn Jenner, formerly known as Bruce Jenner, is not just a decathlete and television personality but also a figure who challenges societal norms and expectations. By proudly embracing her cellulite, she exemplifies the importance of self-respect and body acceptance. As rumors continue to circulate, it is essential to rely on accurate information when discussing Jenner's life and experiences."

While this news may come as a relief to his fans, it is worth noting that Pitt has shown remarkable dedication to raising awareness and funds for those afflicted with rare diseases.

One such condition is Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB), a rare skin disorder. Pitt is an honorary member of the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation (EBMRF), an organization committed to supporting individuals with this debilitating disorder. Earlier this year, Pitt made an appearance at the Rock4EB charity event, where he introduced singer Chris Cornell, in aid of the EBMRF.

Additionally, Pitt has openly discussed his own self-diagnosis with another rare condition known as prosopagnosia, also referred to as face blindness. In a 2013 interview with Esquire Magazine, he shared his struggles in recognizing familiar faces and how he often forgets people he has met before. It is important to acknowledge that self-diagnosis differs from a formal diagnosis, and certain nuances may be overlooked.

Prosopagnosia is a condition characterized by the inability to recognize familiar faces or stimuli, such as objects or animals. Those affected by this condition often rely on other cues, such as voice, walking style, and hairstyle, to identify individuals. The genetic cause of developmental prosopagnosia is not yet fully understood, but familial evidence suggests a possible autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.

In contrast, Epidermolysis Bullosa is a group of severe genetic skin disorders that primarily impact children. It results in painful skin blistering and erosion throughout the body. The most severe form, known as recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, involves chronic blistering, painful wounds, joint stiffness, and other complications. This condition arises due to a deficiency in type VII collagen (C7), caused by mutations in the COL7A1 gene.

Individuals with Epidermolysis Bullosa endure a lifetime of excruciating pain, with limited treatment options available to alleviate their symptoms. Medical researchers and organizations like the EBMRF strive to find effective solutions for those affected by this devastating disease.

Brad Pitt's involvement in raising awareness for these rare diseases highlights the importance of supporting individuals battling such conditions. His dedication to these causes serves as an inspiration to others, encouraging them to join the fight against these debilitating disorders and bring hope to those in need."

CLOSE At Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump explains to the media that he thinks removing statues like the one","President Trump addressed the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia from Trump Tower in New York City, expressing his belief that both protesters and counter protesters shared responsibility. His comments caused widespread criticism from members of his party and raised concerns about his stance on racial tensions in the country. Despite condemning white supremacists the day before, Trump seemed to backtrack and claim that multiple sides were to blame for the violence. He questioned whether the ""alt-left"" should also be held accountable for their violent actions. Trump explained that he couldn't immediately condemn hate groups because he did not have all the facts regarding the car incident that resulted in one death and multiple injuries. Trump emphasized that unlike most politicians, he wanted to ensure his statements were accurate. However, his delayed and ambiguous response drew heavy criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, who denounced white supremacy and urged for a clear condemnation of the violence. Lawmakers expressed dismay at Trump's suggestion of equivalence between white supremacists and their opponents. In response to the backlash, Trump defended his decision to delay his initial response, blaming the press for being dishonest and stating that he needed to gather all the facts. Former KKK leader David Duke thanked the president for condemning what he referred to as ""leftist terrorists"" in groups like Black Lives Matter and Antifa. Trump faced further criticism when he claimed that not all attendees of the demonstration were racist or neo-Nazis, arguing that some were simply protesting the removal of the Robert E. Lee statue. Republicans rejected this notion, asserting that those who attended a Klan rally were likely racist or bigoted. Senator Marco Rubio highlighted the danger of an ideology that promotes hatred and justifies violence against people based on race or ethnicity. Rubio urged Trump not to assign only 50% of the blame to white supremacists, as it would give them a sense of victory. The president's impromptu press conference, originally intended to focus on infrastructure, revolved mainly around Charlottesville. Trump expressed skepticism towards the removal of Confederate statues and monuments by local governments, questioning whether tributes to George Washington and Thomas Jefferson would also be at risk due to their slave ownership. Despite these comments, Trump acknowledged that local authorities had the freedom to make decisions on these matters."

She says the rapper gripped her tightly with his arm and brought her and her friends to his dressing room.  Once in the dressing room, the accuser claims Nelly escorted her into a separate room and began to masturbate in front of her. According to her account, Nelly also tried to take her top off and force her to perform oral sex. As she ran away, she claims he called her a “cunt”.  The investigation comes just months after the rapper, known chiefly for songs like Dilemma and Hot in Herre, was arrested in Washington state after being accused of rape by a 22-year-old student at the University of Washington named Monique Green.

Soon after Nelly was sued for both sexual assault and defamation after his public denials. In a filing from January by Greene’s legal team, two more women came forward with anonymous accusations of sexual assault against the rapper. The lawsuit alleges a “pattern of conduct” in which Nelly “preyed upon his selected female fans”.

According to sources, Mariah, aged 47, expressed her love for Bryan, 34, through an unconventional proposal. The singer composed a song dedicated to her desire of marrying Bryan, which she performed while adorned in an elegant gown. This heartfelt gesture was followed by Mariah expressing her readiness to formalize their relationship. Bryan, overwhelmed by this extraordinary moment, responded with an enthusiastic ""yes"" to Mariah's proposal.

Evidently, Bryan shares Mariah's sentiment and envisions a future together. The couple wasted no time in starting their wedding preparations, disregarding the notion of waiting for the perfect moment. Mariah has expressed a preference for holding the ceremony at the Grand Wailea Resort in Maui, a place of sentimental significance as it marks the start of their publicized romance. Additionally, the idea of a winter-themed wedding, considering Mariah's association with Christmas, has piqued her interest.

Taking into account Mariah's previous marital experiences with Tommy Mottola and Nick Cannon, both ending in heartbreak, Mariah is being prudent in safeguarding her substantial fortune. To ensure a secure future, she is reportedly in the process of creating a prenuptial agreement, leaving nothing to chance.

Interestingly, Nick Cannon, Mariah's ex-husband and father to their twins, Morocco and Monroe, is expected to play an important role in the upcoming wedding. Mariah may even request that Nick accompany her down the aisle. This proposition is not surprising, especially given their recent joint appearance at the 2018 Kids' Choice Awards, highlighting the enduring bond between Mariah, Nick, and their children.

As Mariah Carey contemplates her pursuit of marital bliss once again, it is evident that her love life continues to captivate the public's interest. The possibility of an imminent wedding leaves us eagerly awaiting further developments and an invitation to witness the culmination of Mariah's heartfelt journey."

A source from the Globe asserts that Nicole's tendency to be inconsistent is a source of frustration for her husband, Keith. As she matures, it appears that this trait is becoming more pronounced. With an abundance of responsibilities, she finds it challenging to stay organized and focused. There have been instances where she's engaged in a long-distance conversation with Keith, only to inadvertently neglect him by placing him on hold and subsequently forgetting about him. Not only does her behavior cause annoyance within the movie industry, but she has also acquired a reputation for withdrawing from film projects after initially expressing interest. The source claims that she readily agrees to participate but fails to follow through. As of now, neither Nicole nor Keith have officially responded to the statements made by the Globe."

In her quest to secure the role of the Gotham City heroine, she recently embarked on a Twitter campaign, urging director Joss Whedon to consider casting her. Taking to the platform, she posed the question to her followers: ""RT if I should star in the new BATGIRL movie and everyone tell @joss [sic]"". Lohan's determination to earn an audition for the role has prompted her to reach out to Ben Affleck, renowned for his portrayal of Batman in the DC Extended Universe, for assistance in securing the part of Batgirl, a role known for its captivating portrayal of a courageous redhead.

A reliable source has revealed to Australia's NW Magazine that Lohan has persistently attempted to communicate with Affleck, as she admires his resilience in the face of adversity. Affleck, having overcome personal challenges, notably sharing his experiences with alcoholism while visiting Lohan during her time in rehab in 2013, inspired her to embark on her own journey towards sobriety. This encounter marked the beginning of a friendship between the two actors.

Nonetheless, director Joss Whedon, 53, has expressed his desire to cast an unknown actress, emphasizing the importance of finding the perfect fit for the iconic role. In his own words, ""I doubt it will be a name. This is somewhere where you go and find Batgirl and then you cast her.

Reflecting on her experiences, the accomplished star of ""Mean Girls"" admits that she struggled to navigate fame at a young age. She relishes the serenity offered by Dubai, where she can have fun in a different, more fulfilling manner.

In conclusion, Lindsay Lohan's unwavering determination to portray Batgirl, combined with her friendship with Ben Affleck, has placed her in contention for the highly coveted role. However, she must surpass stiff competition, including Emma Stone, as director Joss Whedon seeks an exceptional yet unfamiliar talent to encapsulate the essence of Batgirl. Lohan, having cultivated a more private and fulfilling life in Dubai, is eagerly awaiting the outcome of this exciting casting process."

For the past seventeen years, Jackman had to maintain peak physical condition to execute shirtless scenes for the movies. He unveiled the rigorous process that accompanied filming such scenes, involving the consumption of ten liters of water daily in the months leading up to filming, which in turn caused dehydration.

gossipcop-888597,"It looks like talk show host and walrus-American Dr. Phil may have made a mistake. And no, we don't just mean catapulting Danielle Bregoli to fame and millions.  No - Dr. Phil was involved in a traffic accident. And the skateboarder he hit might be in for a serious payday. But ... it's complicated.  With the possible exception of a few midwestern grandmas, we don't think that anyone actually thinks that Dr. Phil is infallible.  ... Or the sort of expert to whom you should be listening about the most important things in your life, honestly.  He's just a guy whom some people find charming and folksy and he makes for good television.  Like, one of the statements from his show that's highlighted on his Instagram page is ""Parenting is both a noun and a verb.""  ... Yes.  That is literally how language works. (When a progressive verb is working as a noun, it's called a gerund)  But passing that off as something with profound meaning is more than a little goofy.  So ... you're probably wondering what Dr. Phil did wrong.  The short version? Dr. Phil reportedly hit a guy with his car.  According to TMZ, who broke the story, Dr. Phil's car accident happened when the TV star was emerging from a Universal City parking lot.  This was on Friday.  Apparently, Dr. Phil made an impatient attempt to pass a van, and ended up hitting Terrence Bembury -- a 20-something skateboarder and bodybuilder.  Now, getting hit by a car is most people's nightmare.  Getting hit by a car driven by a guy worth an estimated $400 million ... well, if you're okay afterwards, that's the stuff that dreams are made of, right?  There are a couple of versions of how this went down.  One version, the police account (though it looks like no officers were actual witnesses to the collision), says that Terrence Bembury shook hands with Dr. Phil and told him that he was fine.  (Pro-tip: never tell people that you're fine; an impact from even a slow-moving car can cause injuries that you might not notice right away. Sometimes, those injuries can be very serious.

And no, we don't just mean catapulting Danielle Bregoli to fame and millions.  No - Dr. Phil was involved in a traffic accident. And the skateboarder he hit might be in for a serious payday. But ... it's complicated.  With the possible exception of a few midwestern grandmas, we don't think that anyone actually thinks that Dr. Phil is infallible.  ... Or the sort of expert to whom you should be listening about the most important things in your life, honestly.  He's just a guy whom some people find charming and folksy and he makes for good television.  Like, one of the statements from his show that's highlighted on his Instagram page is ""Parenting is both a noun and a verb.""  ... Yes.  That is literally how language works. (When a progressive verb is working as a noun, it's called a gerund)  But passing that off as something with profound meaning is more than a little goofy.  So ... you're probably wondering what Dr. Phil did wrong.  The short version? Dr. Phil reportedly hit a guy with his car.  According to TMZ, who broke the story, Dr. Phil's car accident happened when the TV star was emerging from a Universal City parking lot.  This was on Friday.  Apparently, Dr. Phil made an impatient attempt to pass a van, and ended up hitting Terrence Bembury -- a 20-something skateboarder and bodybuilder.  Now, getting hit by a car is most people's nightmare.  Getting hit by a car driven by a guy worth an estimated $400 million ... well, if you're okay afterwards, that's the stuff that dreams are made of, right?  There are a couple of versions of how this went down.  One version, the police account (though it looks like no officers were actual witnesses to the collision), says that Terrence Bembury shook hands with Dr. Phil and told him that he was fine.  (Pro-tip: never tell people that you're fine; an impact from even a slow-moving car can cause injuries that you might not notice right away. Sometimes, those injuries can be very serious. Also, never tell the other person ""sorry,"" even if you do feel sorry, as that can be used against you as an admission of fault)  Terrence Bembury now paints a different picture, posting about being injured.

There was no truth to that claim, and the same goes for this latest one.","Tobey Maguire's alleged pursuit of Emma Stone and obtaining her phone number at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles is nothing more than a fabricated tabloid report, according to Gossip Cop. Our exclusive investigation reveals that this incident never took place. 

Life & Style magazine claims that Maguire recently spotted Stone at the famed Hollywood hotel and engaged in observing her attentively, hoping for her acknowledgment. The publication's questionable source suggests that the actor eventually approached Stone and proceeded to shower her with insincere compliments, emphasizing the adoration she receives from the entire entertainment industry. 

Supposedly, Stone exhibited disinterest towards Maguire's advancements but eventually relented, providing him with her contact information and suggesting a coffee meeting, before swiftly departing. The alleged insider insinuates that Stone's actions made it apparent that she was dismissive of Maguire's attempts. 

However, Gossip Cop, in direct communication with a reliable source close to Maguire, found the entire narrative presented by the tabloid to be fabricated and baseless. Our source confirms that these events simply did not occur. Regrettably, it comes as no surprise that Life & Style would publish such a fictitious story. In the past, Gossip Cop had already debunked the outlet's false claim of Eva Mendes experiencing jealousy over Stone's friendship with Ryan Gosling. Both stories lack credibility and should be dismissed."

The young singer, known for his trendsetting ways, chose a unique oval stone for the engagement ring, signaling a resurgence in popularity for this shape. With a captivating six-carat, F-G color grade, and VS clarity diamond, valued at around $400,000, the ring is truly a sight to behold. Baldwin proudly wears the oval diamond on a beautiful rose gold pavé band, accompanied by a standalone wedding-like band.

According to industry expert Andrew Brown, President of WP Diamonds, oval stones have been somewhat rare in recent years, making this choice all the more special. As a close friend of Baldwin's, Bieber knew exactly what he wanted before they embarked on their romantic trip, surprising her with his heartfelt proposal. Despite feeling some nervous excitement beforehand, the Canadian superstar is overjoyed that she accepted his proposal.

The oval diamond bears a striking resemblance to Blake Lively's engagement ring from Ryan Reynolds, which was also designed by Lorraine Schwartz.

As news of their engagement broke, it became evident that this milestone in their relationship was not as sudden as it may seem. Bieber has been incredibly happy in recent weeks, and the couple's long-standing friendship has provided a strong foundation for their romance. The engagement signifies their deep connection and shared understanding.

For the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!","During the production of the Netflix show Maniac, a close friendship developed between the actors Justin and Emma. This has led to speculation about their romantic involvement during a period when Justin and his former wife, Jen, were still married. Jen, who has previously witnessed her spouse becoming involved with a co-star on a film set, understandably has concerns about this situation. Reflecting on Justin's past relationship with Angelina Jolie, Jen cannot help but question if history is repeating itself. Adding to her distress, Jen has considered Emma a close friend for some time and feels betrayed by recent revelations of Emma and Justin's interactions. She interprets Emma's decision to align with Justin after their split as a betrayal of their friendship. Jen seeks clarity regarding the timeline of their involvement, as their recent outing suggested a level of familiarity that goes beyond merely a first encounter. Jen is deeply humiliated by these circumstances and feels manipulated. The separation between Jen and Justin occurred in February of this year, and Justin has maintained his friendship with Emma since then. Publicly, Justin has posted pictures of them together on his Instagram, but he has insisted that they are merely friends. However, they were spotted attending a Louis Vuitton show as a pair just a month after the split. Additionally, Justin has been linked to other women, including Aubrey Plaza and Petra Collins, while Emma has reportedly been dating writer Dave McCarthy since last year. Rumors have circulated that Jen and her ex-husband Brad Pitt, who recently finalized his divorce from Angelina Jolie, may be reconciling. Furthermore, there have been allegations of Jen's pregnancy with Brad's child, supported by her concealment of what appeared to be a baby bump upon disembarking from a private plane a few weeks ago. However, recent controversies suggest that Brad Pitt is secretly involved with architect Neri Oxman, leaving Jen to consider the possibility of single parenthood. Since their separation, Jen and Justin have maintained distance, and sources indicate that they had an intense argument when Justin returned to their Bel Air home to collect his remaining belongings. Now, with the public release of images depicting Justin's intimate date with Emma, it is expected that the relationship between Justin and Jen will become even more strained.

She also claimed that Kayleigh Morris outed her on social media following the huge fight during Vendettas, in which other women in the house threw Kaleigh’s luggage over the balcony. While Natalie claims she was not part of the “mean girls” moment, as the show phrased it, Kaleigh didn’t believe her, later calling her a “lesbian” on social media.  “She did it in a really malicious way, and that’s what really hurt me. The way she did it. She was saying, ‘She doesn’t even like d—k, she likes p—sy. She’s a lesbian.’ I’m not a lesbian, I’m pansexual,” Natalie, 28, told Us Weekly on the “Watch With Us” podcast. “She outed me in a really aggressive way and kept going. It was really homophobic in a way. To me, that’s getting gay shamed. Then there was a whole bunch of people that started gay-shaming me, calling me a ‘dyke,’ going on my social media and attacking me for being gay.”  Natalie wasn’t ready to come out – and didn’t plan on doing so on the show. In fact, she hadn’t told her family at the time of Kayleigh’s comments. Since, she has called everyone and was forced to open up about everything.  “It’s been a 28-year battle for me,” Natalie said. “I wanted to set a standard because you can’t do that. There are so many teenagers and kids that commit suicide every year because they get outed inappropriately. She took something that was mine and made it her own, and she did it really in a nasty way. Outing someone is not right and I want to set that standard … I wanted to come out in the right way, I wanted to turn it into something positive so that viewers that are going through the same thing that I’ve gone through don’t have to go through it for 28 years.”  Natalie also revealed she is in an exclusive relationship with a woman, who she describes as her “biggest supporter.” After Vendettas, Natalie and Johnny Bananas dated casually while both seeing other people. Ultimately, it just didn’t work.  The former NFL cheerleader added: “She’s a really great fit for me, and she’s really special to me.”  Listen to the podcast above to hear more about Natalie’s journey, what happened between she and Johnny, how it’s been working with Paul Calafiore and more.

gossipcop-886177,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Harvey Weinstein, 66, has denied non-consensual sex Hollywood has been rocked by allegations against film mogul Harvey Weinstein - which first came to light in a New York Times article. Since then, the story has developed continuously, with a large number of women coming forward to say they were sexually harassed or assaulted by Weinstein - allegations he has denied. Here is a summary of the events so far: 5 October 2017 The New York Times publishes a story detailing decades of allegations of sexual harassment against Harvey Weinstein. Actresses Rose McGowan and Ashley Judd are among the women who come forward. Among the accusations are that he forced women to massage him and watch him naked. He also promised to help advance their careers in return for sexual favours. Weinstein issues an apology acknowledging he ""has caused a lot of pain"" - but disputes allegations he harassed female employees over nearly three decades.

gossipcop-942572,"Television networks, viewers, readers and restauranteurs are paying tribute to Anthony Bourdain this weekend, one day after he was found dead in a hotel room in France.  His books are occupying six of the top 10 spots on Amazon's bestsellers list, a sign of immense interest in reading or re-reading his books like ""Kitchen Confidential.""  And some of his past TV shows are re-airing in his honor.  On Friday there were pop-up tributes outside Les Halles, the New York restaurant where Bourdain worked in the 1990s. Fans left bouquets and handwritten messages on the walls and door of the shuttered French brasserie.  At CNN in Atlanta, a mourner placed a flower and a note next to a poster of Bourdain in the lobby. And at CNN in New York, an employee placed post-it notes with hearts on one of his posters.  CNN was Bourdain's home for the past five years, so the loss has caused heartache throughout the organization. The network quickly produced an hour-long remembrance that premiered on Friday night and will re-air Sunday at 10 p.m. ET.  Related: Inside Anthony Bourdain's globe-trotting career  Other CNN programs are also honoring Bourdain's legacy.  ""It is hard to imagine he is gone,"" Anderson Cooper said Friday night. ""Hard to imagine he is not just off on some far away journey, hard to imagine he will not soon return with new foods to share, new stories to tell.""  Before Bourdain died, CNN had planned to run a marathon of past ""Parts Unknown"" episodes on Saturday night. The network is moving forward with that plan, but with an adjustment -- the marathon will feature some of Bourdain's all-time favorite episodes.  Additionally, the Travel Channel will air a 12-hour marathon of Bourdain's previous show ""No Reservations"" on Sunday starting at 7 a.m. Eastern.  A new episode of ""Parts Unknown"" featuring Berlin was already scheduled to premiere Sunday at 9 p.m. CNN says it will still air, but now ""with a special introduction by Anderson Cooper.""  That episode will be followed by the tribute special.

His books are occupying six of the top 10 spots on Amazon's bestsellers list, a sign of immense interest in reading or re-reading his books like ""Kitchen Confidential.""  And some of his past TV shows are re-airing in his honor.  On Friday there were pop-up tributes outside Les Halles, the New York restaurant where Bourdain worked in the 1990s. Fans left bouquets and handwritten messages on the walls and door of the shuttered French brasserie.  At CNN in Atlanta, a mourner placed a flower and a note next to a poster of Bourdain in the lobby. And at CNN in New York, an employee placed post-it notes with hearts on one of his posters.  CNN was Bourdain's home for the past five years, so the loss has caused heartache throughout the organization. The network quickly produced an hour-long remembrance that premiered on Friday night and will re-air Sunday at 10 p.m. ET.

""Hard to imagine he is not just off on some far away journey, hard to imagine he will not soon return with new foods to share, new stories to tell.""  Before Bourdain died, CNN had planned to run a marathon of past ""Parts Unknown"" episodes on Saturday night. The network is moving forward with that plan, but with an adjustment -- the marathon will feature some of Bourdain's all-time favorite episodes.  Additionally, the Travel Channel will air a 12-hour marathon of Bourdain's previous show ""No Reservations"" on Sunday starting at 7 a.m. Eastern.  A new episode of ""Parts Unknown"" featuring Berlin was already scheduled to premiere Sunday at 9 p.m. CNN says it will still air, but now ""with a special introduction by Anderson Cooper.""

gossipcop-3308884181,"Beyoncé Rumored To Be Asking For Silent Delivery  As the countdown to Blueprint 1 and Blueprint 2’s arrival continues, the stories about Bey’s birth plans abound. First, we heard she planned to give birth at home, then they said her security has been running weekly drills to practice their approach to Cedars-Sinai and now there’s a report that Bey wants silence in the delivery room.  According to Naughty Gossip reports:  “Beyoncé likes peace and calm around her. She has zero time for drama and gossip. She likes her inner circle to be soft spoken if they have to talk at all. And you can expect the same will be true when she gives birth to the twins,” sources tell Straight Shuter. “You can only get into her private life if you are invited. She is very guarded and protects her privacy at all cost. She likes to be surrounded with peaceful colors and soft sounds. This will be of utmost importance for her when giving birth.”  This story is almost like opening up a fortune cookie or visiting your average storefront psychic. EVERYBODY knows Beyoncé is private. THAT doesn’t take an exclusive source to figure out.  Silent birth is a real thing though – something that Scientologists practice and Katie Holmes even did when she gave birth to Suri, but as much as Bey loves music we don’t really see her doing a silent birth.

GettyImages/Instagram","Rumors Circulate that Beyoncé Plans for a Silent Delivery

With the imminent arrival of Blueprint 1 and Blueprint 2, speculations surrounding Beyoncé's birth plans have been increasing. Initially, there were reports of her intention to give birth at home, followed by claims that her security team has been meticulously preparing for their approach to Cedars-Sinai. Recently, a new report has emerged, stating that Beyoncé wishes for silence in the delivery room.

According to reliable sources from Naughty Gossip, ""Beyoncé values peace and tranquility in her surroundings. She actively avoids unnecessary drama and gossip. When it comes to communication within her inner circle, she prefers soft-spoken individuals or no talking at all. It is only through invitation that others may enter her private life. She is extremely protective of her privacy and prioritizes a serene environment, characterized by peaceful colors and gentle sounds, even during childbirth.""

While it is commonly known that Beyoncé is a private individual, these revelations regarding her birthing preferences are reminiscent of opening up a fortune cookie or visiting an average storefront psychic. Furthermore, the concept of silent birth, although practiced by some Scientologists and even by Katie Holmes during her delivery of Suri, does not seem to align with Beyoncé's deep affinity for music.

Speaking of her love for music, we invite you to view some recently posted images of Beyoncé, captured during a Michael Jackson/Prince themed party, by flipping through the slideshow provided by GettyImages/Instagram."

Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner’s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  ‘She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,’ said the source. ‘But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making ‘I am Cait’ shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner’s ‘unpredictable’ behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: ‘[The book] is definitely something that she’s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  ‘But the family were like, it’s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  ‘They were worried because she’s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.’  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J.

The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’  An insider tells DailyMail.com that the Kardashians learned of the 67-year-old’s plan from her model son Brody, 33.  ‘Brody told them that Caitlyn has planned and booked a full nude photo shoot and they were like, that’s unacceptable, it’s taking things too far,' the source said.  ‘They’re hoping the shoot doesn't come to pass because that would be their worst nightmare. Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner’s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  ‘She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,’ said the source. ‘But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making ‘I am Cait’ shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner’s ‘unpredictable’ behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: ‘[The book] is definitely something that she’s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  ‘But the family were like, it’s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  ‘They were worried because she’s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.’  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty of the murder of his wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.  Kardashian, the father of Kourtney, Khloe, Kim and their brother Rob, was part of Simpson’s defense team during his 1","Caitlyn Jenner, at the age of 67, has recently undergone gender reassignment surgery in January, as detailed in her memoir 'The Secrets of My Life.' In an effort to highlight her journey, Jenner has planned a nude photo shoot, which is anticipated to be a defining moment since her transition was publicly announced in an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer in April 2015, followed by a stunning appearance in Vanity Fair. Although the Kardashian-Jenner family is said to be fully supportive of Jenner's transition, sources close to the family reveal that a nude shoot represents their worst nightmare. A reliable insider has disclosed that the Kardashian-Jenner clan became aware of this plan through Jenner's son, Brody. The family views this as an excessive and unnecessary step. Kris Jenner, who reportedly had prior knowledge of Jenner's surgery, has pledged to prevent the photo shoot from taking place. Communications have been initiated with both Jenner's and the Kardashian family's representatives for further comments on the matter. It's worth noting that Jenner's previous appearance in Vanity Fair, known as the 'I am Cait' shoot, caused tension within the family at the time, particularly between Jenner and Kim Kardashian. However, despite internal conflicts, the family has publicly voiced their support for Jenner's decision to transition, which was ultimately completed in January. Jenner herself expressed her satisfaction with the surgery, stating, 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated. I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.' Unfortunately, these recent developments have strained Jenner's relationship with her former spouse and step-children. The memoir, composed with the assistance of journalist Buzz Bissinger, has intensified the discord and magnified Jenner's unpredictable behavior, causing further estrangement with her family. It is clear that the memoir was a long-desired project for Jenner, and the family was apprehensive about the potential reopening of past conflicts. Given Jenner's recent unpredictable behavior and her desire for attention, the family has been wary throughout this process. Additionally, an embarrassing revelation emerged from another leaked extract of the memoir, wherein Jenner claimed that the late Robert Kardashian knew of O.J. Simpson's guilt in the murder of Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman. Kardashian, who was the father of Kourtney, Khloe, Kim, and Rob Kardashian, was a member of Simpson's defense team during his highly publicized trial."

It’s been a little more than eight years since the mother of eight’s divorce from Jon Gosselin was finalized in December 2009, and now, the Kate Plus 8 star is ready to give love another chance.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  PEOPLE can exclusively reveal that Gosselin, 43, will star in new TLC series Kate Plus Date, which will document the reality star on her dating journey.  “I’m nervous, I’m excited, and I’m forcing myself to do this,” Gosselin, who was married to ex-husband Jon for 10 years, tells PEOPLE about the upcoming docuseries.  In fall 2019, her two eldest children — twins Mady and Cara, both 17 — will go off to college, leaving Gosselin at home with 13-year-old sextuplets Aaden, Joel, Alexis, Hannah and Leah. (Collin is enrolled in a program away from home to help him reach his full potential.)  “As we’re talking about Mady and Cara going off to college which is becoming more and more of a reality, it’s gonna happen, it almost became like a worry for them, too, like ‘Mommy, you’re gonna be all alone soon,’ ” shares Gosselin. “But it was very apparent, now that they’re older and talking about dating and how they’re all gonna get married someday … it became apparent: they want someone for me. They want me to have somebody in my life.”  Larsen & Talbert  In a moment of reflection, Gosselin says she “started picturing myself sitting in a rocking chair, knitting, and words like ‘old maid’ and ‘spinster’ started to come to mind, and I realized that no, I don’t want that to be my fate.”  “I stopped focusing on myself — I used to be a runner, and all of these things sort of fell by the wayside, and I sort of forgot about the dating thing,” she says. “It’s never really fit into my life.”  Though Gosselin admits her life is “very complicated,” she won’t allow that to hold her back from the possibility of finding happily ever after.  “If I’m going to date someone, I can’t just go out on a date — it’s creepy to me to think of just going out somewhere with some stranger, and so I actually feel like doing it like this is the best and safest way for me to go on a date — a camera crew will be there! I’ll be safe!” she says. “And the person will have been vetted by a matchmaker.”  For Gosselin, having her dating life documented for cameras is safer — and far less intimidating — than going online.  “I won’t be just doing some scary online thing,” she says. “I mean, online dating, seriously — I put my profile in there and people will know who it is within 90 seconds. No, this is probably the safest way for me to date, let’s be honest.”  WATCH: Story Behind the Story: A Lesson Kate Gosselin Had to Learn the Hard Way  As for what Gosselin is looking for in a match, she’s “not sure,” but remains “open: whoever they match me with, I’m game.”  “I do want someone with a set career, who is confident. A grown-up with their own life, their own agenda, who knows who they are. If someone travels for work, that would be great, because I’m used to being on my own and being self-sufficient,” she shares.  She doesn’t want anyone she has “to care of,” but rather desires a man who is “self-sufficient, who won’t suffocate me.”  The TLC personality asserts that the lucky guy she could one day introduce to her kids “won’t be my kids’ dad,” but rather “would love my kids to have a mutual friendship and respect with this guy and for him to be someone they can ask for advice. It would be great for my kids to have someone they can feel like is a real friend.”  Most importantly, Gosselin says her perfect match “must love dogs.”  “That is such a deal-breaker,” says Gosselin, who frequently shares photos of her furry family members on social media. “People disappoint you, but your dogs never will.”  Kate Plus Date is coming to TLC this fall.",0,en,0,"Kate Gosselin is ready to get back into the dating scene.

The former Real Housewife of New York, ran around the grounds in an A-line Carolina Herrera dress, posing on the step-and-repeat, taking photos with fans, and catching up with old friends. Trying to track her down for an interview turned into a scavenger hunt.  Scattered around the lawn were tables for vendors selling everything from wine to sex toys. There was a station for guests to get a vitamin infusion, with seats in the direct line of the sun transforming the spot into an inescapable sauna-I.V. drip hybrid.

Upon first try to flag Zarin down for a couple of questions, she sent over her daughter, Ally Shapiro, in her stead. Shapiro reflected on last year’s luncheon, when her stepfather was still struggling with cancer, but encouraged her and her mother to party on.  “He loved drinking and partying. This was the highlight of his year,” she said. “It was this time last year that we were told he wasn’t gonna make it another week, and he pushed us and he said, ‘Go to the party. Maybe I won’t be here when you come back, but go.’”  Shapiro, who now lives in London while she works on her master’s degree, admits that she can’t watch old episodes of Real Housewives, which showed her as 14-year-old struggling to get close to her stepfather. “You want to think that it’s like a home movie, but it’s not. That’s not what our relationship was like,” she said, adding that the reruns play constantly in the U.K. “I’m walking down the street and someone’s like, ‘Oh my God, I just saw you trying on a prom dress!’”  She also said that her mother is dabbling with dating, specifically with a man she plays tennis with. “It’s fun, and I live in London so it’s good for her to have a distraction.”  Dina Lohan, dressed in a metallic green blazer and shorts set and a pair of oversized aviators, arrived fashionably late to the affair, but was immediately greeted by hoards of people trying to chat her up or get a photo. Eventually secured in the same spot for more than a few seconds, she was willing to talk about her daughter Lindsay’s upcoming project for MTV, a Vanderpump Rules–inspired reality show that follows Lindsay and the employees of her new Lohan Beach Club. Bunim/Murray Productions is producing the series, the same company that produced Lohan’s E! reality show Living Lohan a decade ago.  “These kids were like, babies, and now they’re running the show,” she said of the crew. “They lived in my house! And now they’re all corporate. . . . We’re home. It’s cyclical, you know.”  Lohan also revealed that the upcoming series is a bit of a family affair with Lindsay’s younger sister, 24-year-old Ali, providing the theme song.  A friend of Lohan’s interjected, asking if Ali, like her older sister over a decade ago, had moved out to L.A. for work.  “She’s in New York with me,” the matriarch answered. “I keep them close!

The former Real Housewife of New York, elegantly attired in a Carolina Herrera dress, graciously interacted with attendees. The pursuit of an interview with Zarin turned into quite the scavenger hunt. The event featured an array of vendors selling diverse items, ranging from wine to sex toys. Notably, a station provided guests with vitamin infusions, albeit under the direct exposure of the sun, turning the area into an unavoidable hybrid of a sauna and I.V. drip. Housewives from different parts of the country, including Vicki Gunvalson from Orange County and LeeAnne Locken from Dallas, flew in to attend the luncheon. The gathering also served as a benefit for Thyroid Cancer Research, paying tribute to Zarin's late husband, Bobby, who tragically succumbed to the illness in January.

Upon initial attempts to approach Zarin for an interview, she delegated her daughter, Ally Shapiro, to represent her. Shapiro shared her reflections on last year's luncheon, during which her stepfather battled cancer. Despite the circumstances, he encouraged them to attend the celebration, as he himself had cherished the joyous occasion. Shapiro, currently residing in London to pursue her master's degree, admitted her difficulty watching past episodes of Real Housewives, as they portray her struggles at the age of 14 to forge a connection with her stepfather. The reruns of the show are incessantly broadcasted in the U.K., leading to unexpected encounters with recognition from strangers. Shapiro also disclosed that her mother is venturing into the dating scene, specifically with a man she plays tennis with, providing a welcome distraction for her in London.

Dina Lohan, donned in a stylish metallic green blazer and shorts ensemble, arrived fashionably late to the luncheon, immediately attracting a crowd of people eager to engage in conversation or take a photo with her. Eventually finding a moment of respite, she candidly discussed Lindsay's upcoming MTV project, a reality show inspired by Vanderpump Rules, which will follow Lindsay and the employees of her new establishment, Lohan Beach Club. Interestingly, Bunim/Murray Productions, the same company that produced Lindsay's reality show on E! a decade ago, is producing this new series. Reflecting on the past, Lohan remarked on how the crew had grown from young individuals living in her house to now occupying corporate positions. She also shared that Lindsay's younger sister, Ali, has contributed the theme song for the show. When asked if Ali had also relocated to Los Angeles for work, Dina reassured that both of her daughters are together in New York, emphasizing her desire to keep her family close after previous experiences of separation.

Finally, amidst the festivities, Jill Zarin paused to catch her breath. Though no longer a Bravo housewife, she has not lost her ability to engage and socialize with others. Zarin has kept up with the current season of the show, receiving a supportive message from Luann de Lesseps, who recently entered rehab, expressing her well wishes for the event. Concluding our conversation, Zarin promoted her new line of rugs named ""Jill Zarin Rugs,"" which are not only pleasing to the eye, but also resistant to pet-related mishaps. It seems that once a housewife, always a housewife."

The MCU is the shared universe in which all of the films are set. The films have been in production since 2007, and in that time Marvel Studios has produced and released 20 films, with 11 more in various stages of production. It is the highest-grossing film franchise of all time, having grossed over $17.5 billion at the global box office. Kevin Feige has produced every film in the series, alongside Avi Arad for the first two releases, Gale Anne Hurd for The Incredible Hulk, Amy Pascal for the Spider-Man films, and Stephen Broussard for Ant-Man and the Wasp. The films are written and directed by a variety of individuals and feature large, often ensemble, casts. Many of the actors, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Samuel L. Jackson, and Scarlett Johansson signed contracts to star in numerous films. The first film in the series was Iron Man (2008), which was distributed by Paramount Pictures. Paramount also distributed Iron Man 2 (2010), Thor (2011) and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), while Universal Pictures distributed The Incredible Hulk (2008). Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures began distributing the films with the 2012 crossover film The Avengers,[1] which concluded Phase One of the franchise. Phase Two includes Iron Man 3 (2013), Thor: The Dark World (2013), Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), and Ant-Man (2015). Captain America: Civil War (2016) is the first film in the franchise's Phase Three, and is followed by Doctor Strange (2016), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Black Panther (2018), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018), with Captain Marvel (2019) and Avengers: Endgame (2019) still scheduled for the phase. Spider-Man: Far From Home has also been scheduled for 2019, beginning Phase Four. Two untitled films are scheduled for 2020, three for 2021, and three for 2022.

Favreau said that he included the scene as ""a little tip of the hat for the fans...a way to sort of tee up The Avengers."" Jackson was only on set for a day, with a skeleton crew to avoid the news of his cameo leaking.[28] Captain America's shield is also visible in the background of a scene; it was added by an ILM artist as a joke, and Favreau decided to leave it in the film.[29] The Incredible Hulk (2008) After being exposed to gamma radiation that causes him to transform into the monstrous Hulk, scientist Bruce Banner goes on the run and isolates himself from his love, Betty Ross. Hunted by the military, Banner seeks to cure himself and prevent his condition from being weaponized.[30] In January 2006,[31] Marvel reclaimed the film rights for the Hulk character from Universal Pictures after Universal failed to meet a deadline to develop a sequel to director Ang Lee's 2003 film Hulk.[32] Universal retained distribution rights for future Hulk films.[32] Instead of moving forward with a sequel, Marvel hired Louis Leterrier to direct The Incredible Hulk, a reboot.[6] Leterrier initially turned down the job out of respect for Lee, but later reconsidered and signed on.[6] The script was written by Zak Penn, who drafted a treatment for the 2003 film.[33] In April 2006, Edward Norton entered negotiations to portray Bruce Banner and rewrite Penn's script,[34] although Penn received sole credit for the screenplay.[7] Production began on July 9, 2007 and filming primarily took place in Toronto,[35] with additional filming in New York City and Rio de Janeiro.[36] The film premiered at the Gibson Amphitheatre on June 8, 2008, and was released on June 13.[37][38] The film takes place simultaneously with the events of Iron Man 2 and Thor,[39] the former of which is set six months after the events of Iron Man.[40] Downey briefly reprised his role from Iron Man as Tony Stark in a cameo appearance at the end of the film. Downey said that the filmmakers ""were just cross-pollinating our superheroes. It happens to be a scene where I basically approach [actor William Hurt's character General Ross], and we may be considering going into some sort of limited partnership together.

gossipcop-7384566778,"Kylie Jenner may have skipped out on the 2017 Kardashian Christmas card, but she did attend mom Kris Jenner’s annual Christmas Eve party in Los Angeles.  The 20-year-old cosmetics guru — who is expecting her first child, a baby girl, with boyfriend Travis Scott — did not appear in any photos from the bash shared to social media by KarJenner family members. But a source tells PEOPLE she was there celebrating away from the cameras.  “Kylie looked great but didn’t really draw any attention to her baby bump,” the source says. “She still acts like she wants to keep her pregnancy private.”  Meanwhile, her sister Khloé Kardashian, — who earlier this week confirmed that she and boyfriend Tristan Thompson are expecting their first child together — accentuated her own baby bump in a skin-tight, sparkly jumpsuit with a white fur coat.  “Khloé was beaming all night,” the insider says of the 33-year-old Revenge Body host. “She kept touching and showing off her cute baby belly.”  Khloé showed off her bump on Instagram as well.  “Merry Christmas!! May you sparkle and shine this festive season, may all of your wishes and dreams come true,” Khloé captioned a gallery of shots showing her touching her belly. “I pray that we all may feel this happiness all year round. God bless you! ✨ #BabyBump🤗”  “Merry Christmas!!!!!

Kourtney’s ex-boyfriend Scott Disick was there, too — without girlfriend Sofia Richie.  “He mingled, looked good and didn’t drink,” the source says, adding that there wasn’t any awkwardness with Kourtney’s new boyfriend Younes Bendjima.  “Kourtney seemed so happy that Younes joined her,” the insider says. “They are so cute together. He kept bringing her drinks and doting on her. Younes fits right into the family. He didn’t seem uncomfortable that Scott was there. They said hello, but that was it. It was very civil.”  Other guests included Kim’s husband Kanye West, celebrity hair stylists Jen Atkin and Chris Appleton, singer Christina Aguilera and Keeping Up with the Kardashians executive producer Ryan Seacrest.

Maintaining her desire for privacy, Kylie did not draw attention to her baby bump during the event.

Khloé radiated happiness throughout the night, often touching and proudly displaying her cute baby bump.

Ellen Pierson further maintains that Robert had voiced concerns about Khloe's paternity due to Kris' infidelity. Despite the controversy, Khloe has always considered Robert to be her father and has a close relationship with him. Kris Jenner has also commented on the matter, admitting in her new book that she cheated on Robert during their marriage. Ellen Pierson has faced financial difficulties since Robert's passing, filing for bankruptcy in 2010, and subsequently losing the home she shared with him in California. Kris Jenner went on to marry Bruce Jenner, with whom she has two daughters. The Kardashians have often discussed Khloe's physical differences and the questions surrounding her paternity.

gossipcop-5865271192,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.

There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T","Regrettably, Katie Holmes finds herself at the center of swirling reports regarding her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise, and their daughter Suri. According to a recent article on RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the brink of embarking on a $300,000 wedding ceremony. It was believed that their union would solidify their relationship, which has remained mostly concealed for the past five years. However, the 39-year-old actress and devoted single mother perceived that her 50-year-old Oscar-winning partner was not prepared to relinquish his flirtatious habits as a bachelor, including his continued friendly connection with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother of his 8-year-old daughter. The report alleges that Foxx even brought Grannis, not Holmes, as his companion to Leonardo DiCaprio's birthday celebration in November.

Consequently, Holmes made the difficult decision to call off the wedding and privately communicated her decision to end the relationship with Foxx, her co-star in ""Django Unchained."" Sources shared with RadarOnline that Foxx hesitated to agree to a prenuptial agreement containing a clause preventing infidelity because he comprehended the potential consequences should he succumb to temptation. ""Katie noticed a complete lack of respect in Jamie's behavior,"" a source divulged to RadarOnline. ""She understood that it wasn't beneficial for her or Suri and felt compelled to safeguard both of them.""

In the midst of these personal challenges, Holmes has been contending with Cruise's resolute efforts to reestablish a connection with their daughter, Suri. As Hollywood Life reported, citing Star magazine, Cruise has been tormented by the fact that he has been an absent father for over five years due to alleged directives from his Church of Scientology superiors. Tom loyal to Scientology unquestioningly complied with their instructions, thereby sacrificing his relationship with Suri. However, it is now conveyed that he regrets having missed out on so much and yearns to be a part of her life once again.

Holmes, on her part, is torn between her reservations about reuniting with Cruise and her desire to prioritize Suri's well-being. The report from Star stated that Holmes entered an agreement, promising to remain silent about Cruise and Scientology as long as he stayed away from their daughter and refrained from attempting to indoctrinate her into the controversial religious organization. An insider disclosed, ""She's gradually entertaining the notion of a reunion since Suri must be desperately missing her dad. Ultimately, Katie wants what's best for her daughter. Tom has reassured her that his religion will not be a part of their relationship, and Katie is starting to believe him.""

Representatives for Holmes have firmly denied both the breakup rumors involving Foxx as well as the reports about a potential reunion between her and Cruise for Suri's sake. However, it is worth noting that the denial regarding the breakup report was issued by Holmes' publicist, Leslie Sloane, who openly attached her name to the statement. This announcement holds significance since it denotes the first official acknowledgment, on the record, from either Holmes or Foxx regarding the existence of their relationship. Since their alleged dating initiation in 2013, both parties have gone to great lengths to keep their romance concealed – at one point, even necessitating Holmes disguising herself to meet Foxx at a restaurant.

The preservation of secrecy was imperative for Holmes, as her divorce settlement from Cruise allegedly restricted her from publicly dating anyone for five years, as per reports from September 2017. These reports emerged after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo, hand-in-hand, strolling along a Malibu beach. At the time, speculation arose, suggesting that the couple willingly allowed themselves to be captured in this way as the five-year ban on public dating had ostensibly expi"

Premise [ edit ] In season one, seventeen year old Clay Jensen returns home from school one day to find a mysterious box on his porch. Inside he discovers seven cassette tapes recorded by Hannah Baker, his deceased classmate and unrequited love, who committed suicide two weeks earlier. On the tapes, Hannah unfolds an intensely emotional audio diary, detailing why she decided to end her life. It appears each person who receives this package of old-style tapes is fundamentally related to why she killed herself. Clay is not the first to receive the tapes, but there is implied detail as to how he should pass the tapes on after hearing them. There appears to be an order to distribution of the tapes, with an additional copy held by an overseer should the plan go awry. Each tape recording refers to a different person involved in Hannah's life contributing to a reason for her suicide. The tapes refer to both friends and enemies. In season two, months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and the other people mentioned on the tapes, as well as close friends and Hannah's family members, become embroiled in a civil legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Alleging negligence on the part of the school, Hannah's mother pursues her perception of justice, while her reluctance to settle pre-trial and her personal circumstances eventually break up her marriage with Hannah's father. The story unfolds with narratives illustrating Hannah's story told by those who present in court at trial. Clay, who ",1,en,"This article is about the television series.

In response, Netflix added a warning card and from March 2018, a video that plays at the start of each season warning viewers about its themes.[2] In May 2017, Netflix renewed 13 Reasons Why for a second season; filming began the next month and concluded that December. The second season was released on May 18, 2018, and received negative reviews from critics and mixed reviews from audiences. A third season was ordered in June 2018 and is set to be released in 2019. Critical and audience reaction to the series has been divided, with the program generating controversy between audiences and industry reviewers. Premise [ edit ] In season one, seventeen year old Clay Jensen returns home from school one day to find a mysterious box on his porch. Inside he discovers seven cassette tapes recorded by Hannah Baker, his deceased classmate and unrequited love, who committed suicide two weeks earlier. On the tapes, Hannah unfolds an intensely emotional audio diary, detailing why she decided to end her life. It appears each person who receives this package of old-style tapes is fundamentally related to why she killed herself. Clay is not the first to receive the tapes, but there is implied detail as to how he should pass the tapes on after hearing them. There appears to be an order to distribution of the tapes, with an additional copy held by an overseer should the plan go awry. Each tape recording refers to a different person involved in Hannah's life contributing to a reason for her suicide. The tapes refer to both friends and enemies. In season two, months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and the other people mentioned on the tapes, as well as close friends and Hannah's family members, become embroiled in a civil legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Alleging negligence on the part of the school, Hannah's mother pursues her perception of justice, while her reluctance to settle pre-trial and her personal circumstances eventually break up her marriage with Hannah's father. The story unfolds with narratives illustrating Hannah's story told by those who present in court at trial. Clay, who perceives himself as Hannah's failed protector, embarks on an investigation using whatever evidence he can find in an effort to impact on the civil case between Hannah's parents and the school. Clay also endeavours to expose the corrupted culture of the High School and its favour of wealthy, sports savvy male students over the average student, which especially compromises the integrity of young girls such as Hannah. Throughout season two, Clay appears to be communicating with the ghost of Hannah as a plot narrative device. Cast and characters [ edit ] Main [ edit ] Recurring [ edit ] Introduced in season one [ edit ] Josh Hamilton as Matt Jensen, Clay's father, a psychologist. Michele Selene Ang as Courtney Crimsen, a closeted student at Liberty High who is responsible for spreading rumors about Hannah to protect the secret of her own sexual orientation. In season 2, she comes out on the stand during the trial of Hannah Baker, confessing her actions against Hannah that landed her on the tapes. Steven Silver as Marcus Cole, the self-centered student body president at Liberty High, who is responsible for humiliating and attempting to sexually assault Hannah on a date. In season 2, he is suspended from school after lying on the stand during the trial and following the leaked release of the tapes soon after. Ajiona Alexus as Sheri Holland, a student and cheerleader at Liberty High who forms a bond with Clay but is also on the tapes when her actions result in Jeff's accidental death. Tommy Dorfman as Ryan Shaver, a student at Liberty High who betrayed Hannah's trust. Sosie Bacon as Skye Miller, an estranged friend of Clay. In the second season, Skye and Clay date for while before she leaves for a ""fresh start"", following another self-harm incident which resulted in her bipolar disorder diagnosis. Timothy Granaderos as Montgomery de la Cruz, a bully who is a student at Liberty High. In season 2, he secretly terrorizes a number of individuals testifying at Hannah Baker's trial. Brandon Larracuente as Jeff Atkins, a student at Liberty","Thirteen Reasons Why (stylized onscreen as TH1RTEEN R3ASONS WHY) is an American teen drama web television series that has been developed for Netflix by Brian Yorkey. It is based on the 2007 novel Thirteen Reasons Why, written by Jay Asher. The series revolves around the life of Clay Jensen, a seventeen-year-old high school student, and his deceased friend Hannah Baker. Hannah tragically took her own life as a result of struggling to cope with the culture, rumors, and lack of support she faced from her friends and school. Before her death, she recorded thirteen reasons on cassette tapes, explaining why she made the decision to end her life.

The television series is a result of the collaborative efforts of July Moon Productions, Kicked to the Curb Productions, Anonymous Content, and Paramount Television. Brian Yorkey and Diana Son are the showrunners. The main characters in the series include Dylan Minnette as Clay Jensen, Katherine Langford as Hannah Baker, Christian Navarro, Alisha Boe, Brandon Flynn, Justin Prentice, Miles Heizer, Ross Butler, Devin Druid, Amy Hargreaves, Derek Luke, Kate Walsh, and Brian d'Arcy James.

Originally, there were plans for a film adaptation of Thirteen Reasons Why by Universal Pictures, with Selena Gomez set to play Hannah. However, those plans were set aside in favor of a television series. Netflix ordered the show straight to series in October 2015, and Selena Gomez became an executive producer instead. The first season of the series premiered on Netflix on March 31, 2017. It received positive reviews from both critics and viewers due to its engaging subject matter and the exceptional performances of Minnette and Langford. Langford's portrayal of Hannah, in particular, earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Drama Series.

While the series was well-received, it also sparked concerns among mental health professionals because of its graphic depiction of sensitive topics such as suicide and rape. In response, Netflix added a warning card and later included a video at the beginning of each season, cautioning viewers about the themes explored in the show. Despite the mixed reactions, Netflix decided to renew Thirteen Reasons Why for a second season, which was released on May 18, 2018. This season received negative reviews from critics, but the audience's response was more varied.

Following the second season, a third season was ordered in June 2018 and is scheduled for release in 2019. The series has generated controversy among both audiences and industry reviewers, with differing opinions on its impact and portrayal of sensitive subjects. 

The premise of the series centers around Clay Jensen receiving a box of cassette tapes left by Hannah Baker, containing her audio diary in which she explains why she made the tragic decision to end her life. Each person who receives the tapes has some connection to Hannah's reasons for suicide. Clay is not the first recipient, and instructions are given regarding how he should pass on the tapes after listening to them. The tapes follow a specific order of distribution, and an overseer holds an additional copy in case the plan encounters any obstacles. Each recording on the tapes sheds light on a different individual from Hannah's life who contributed to her decision to take her own life. 

In the second season, set several months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and other people mentioned on the tapes, along with close friends and family members of Hannah, become involved in a legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Hannah's mother files a lawsuit against the school, alleging negligence. As the trial unfolds, narratives from several individuals present in court provide insights into Hannah's story. Clay, who believes he failed to protect Hannah, launches his own investigation to gather evidence that could impact the outcome of the case. He also aims to expose the toxic culture at the high school that privileges wealthy, athletic male students at the expense of the average student, especially young girls like Hannah.

Throughout the second season, Clay experiences what appears to be communication with Hannah's ghost, which serves as a plot device. The series features an ensemble cast with various recurring characters who play different roles in the storyline.

Thirteen Reasons Why has garnered both praise and criticism for its portrayal of sensitive topics and its impact on viewers. The series has sparked public debate and divided opinions within the industry and among its audience."

In an exclusive conversation with HollywoodLife.com, a close source reveals Selena's reaction to the situation. It seems that Selena would have preferred if Charlie had kept their history private, as she values her personal life and relationships being kept under wraps. Maintaining her privacy when it comes to her dating life is of utmost importance to Selena. Our source informs us that Selena will eventually have to address Charlie's revelation, but it is frustrating for her when people publicly discuss personal matters.

Rumors of a split between Selena and Justin were put to rest when the two were recently seen together at one of Justin's hockey games, arriving separately but leaving together.

Despite the rampant speculation, the 20-year-old reality star has not publicly confirmed the news. This is surprising, given the Kardashian-Jenner family's history of sharing personal details with the world, which has played a significant role in their overwhelming success and popularity.

The lack of confirmation has only intensified the curiosity surrounding Kylie's rumored pregnancy. With reports suggesting that she is due in February and expecting a baby girl with rapper Travis Scott, fans eagerly await any clues or announcements from the young star. Even Kylie's absence from the family's traditional Christmas card caused a stir among her devoted followers.

Fans have resorted to searching for glimpses of the truth themselves, as TMZ released blurry footage of Kylie's recent public appearance, where she was dressed in loose clothing. Additionally, a magazine photoshoot featured Kylie holding a baby lamb in a way that strategically concealed her growing belly. Some speculate that the official announcement may coincide with an episode of ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians,"" as rumors circulated that the season finale would be titled ""We're Expecting!"" However, this information has since been removed from the Wikipedia page.

If Kylie does give birth this month, her child will join the Kardashian family's newest addition, Chicago West, born via surrogate to Kim and Kanye West in January. Khloe Kardashian is also expecting a baby with NBA player Tristan Thompson, due in March. While some believe that Kylie's baby may make a delayed entrance into the public eye, insiders claim that Kylie is savoring her time away from the spotlight and has no plans to sell any photos of her child.

As the Kardashian-Jenner empire continues to expand in 2018, fans eagerly await any developments in Kylie's pregnancy journey, as her decision to keep this major life event private contrasts with her family's usual transparency."

All proceeds from the annual fundraising event — founded by Miami-based DJ Irie — go towards helping the Irie Foundation provide scholarship opportunities and mentoring programs to at-risk youth living in South Florida.  “Of course he’s aware of the headlines surrounding him and Katie but he doesn’t seem worried about that at all,” a source tells PEOPLE. “He’s just his happy, hilarious self.”  DJ Irie and Jamie Foxx Dylan Rives  “Jamie is in town to support his friend Irie and just enjoy a guys’ weekend,” the source explains. “He never misses this but he’s particularly happy for a little escape this year.”  “He got in Friday night and headed straight to Top Golf to meet up with his boys and enjoy the festivities,” the source continues, adding that while there are “women around,” Foxx isn’t “flirting much this time around.”  “He seems just happy to get away and kick back,” the insider remarks.  During the fun-filled evening, Foxx and friends joined Ludacris onstage to perform one of the rapper’s biggest hits, “Move Bitch.”  RELATED: Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes Step Out Separately After Denying Rumors About Their Relationship  Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx Kevin Mazur/Getty Images  Though the Beat Shazam host and Dawson’s Creek star, 39, first being seen dancing with one another in the Hamptons in 2013, have never confirmed their relationship, they’ve been stepping out more often since a photographer captured a rare photo of the pair together, walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach in September.  They also sat together at Clive Davis’ Pre-Grammy Awards Gala in January, played basketball together on Valentine’s Day and were seen leaving Nobu restaurant in New York City on April 22, followed by Carbone on May 1.","Jamie Foxx is currently attending the Monster 14th Annual Irie Weekend in Miami, enjoying the company of his friends. Amidst recent reports about his alleged split from Katie Holmes and the cancellation of their wedding plans due to trust issues, Foxx has taken some time away to support this important fundraising event. The annual event, organized by Miami-based DJ Irie, aims to raise funds for the Irie Foundation, which provides scholarships and mentoring programs to at-risk youth in South Florida.

While aware of the media attention surrounding his personal life, Foxx remains unfazed by the rumors, according to a source close to him. He simply intends to have a good time, showcasing his happy and humorous personality. Foxx's presence at the event is primarily to support his friend Irie and partake in the traditional guys' weekend. This year, particularly, he values the opportunity to escape his usual routine.

Upon arriving on Friday night, Foxx wasted no time and met up with his friends at Top Golf, eagerly engaging in the festivities. Although there are women present at the event, he is not actively seeking flirtation like previous occasions. Rather, his focus is solely on unwinding and enjoying the moment, as confirmed by an insider.

During the enjoyable evening, Foxx and his friends took the stage alongside Ludacris, delivering a spectacular performance of one of the rapper's biggest hits, ""Move Bitch.""

Although Foxx and Holmes have never officially confirmed their relationship, they have been seen together in public on various occasions since 2013 when they were first spotted dancing in the Hamptons. Notably, a rare photograph captured the couple walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach in September. Furthermore, they were seen sitting together at Clive Davis' Pre-Grammy Awards Gala in January, playing basketball on Valentine's Day, and recently leaving popular New York City restaurants such as Nobu and Carbone.

In summary, Foxx's current presence at the Irie Weekend in Miami is an expression of his support for both the event and his friend Irie. Despite ongoing speculation about his personal life, Foxx remains focused on enjoying himself and taking a break from the limelight."

The source said, “Taylor was so young when they dated, she wasn’t ready for a serious relationship, but now she’s showing Jake how much she’s matured.

Magazine, the renowned singer-songwriter has been reaching out to her ex-boyfriend whilst he has been residing in New York City for his role in the Broadway production, Sunday in the Park With George. Citing an anonymous source, the tabloid claims that Taylor believes she has evolved into a more mature individual since their relationship in 2010 and is using this opportunity to showcase her personal growth to Jake. The source asserts, ""Taylor was quite young during their prior involvement, and she wasn't prepared for a committed relationship at the time. However, she now wishes to demonstrate her newfound maturity to Jake. She is genuinely looking forward to seeing where their interaction may lead."" In 2015, unverified rumors emerged suggesting that Taylor and Jake were in contact, despite her being romantically involved with Calvin Harris at the time. Star magazine reported that an undisclosed source mentioned, ""Jake expressed a desire to apologize to Taylor regarding the way their relationship ended."" As a result, during a chance encounter with Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show in June, Jake supposedly requested Taylor's updated phone number. Since then, they have allegedly maintained secret communication. It would be immensely ironic if this speculation held any truth, as Taylor reportedly composed the popular song ""We Are Never Getting Back Together,"" featured on her Red album, as a direct response to their past romance. The singer revealed during an interview with ABC's Good Morning America, ""A friend of my ex walked into a room and started discussing rumors about us reconciling. This wasn't the case at all.

Angelina and her handsome British guy reportedly started dating in early 2017, and has been keeping the whole relationship “very hush-hush.” That means that Brad has no idea she’s dating, let alone engaged or getting married. Uh oh!  “Angelina could tell Brad what’s going on but she’s choosing not to,” a source told InTouch. She reportedly hopes he “will be taken by complete surprise.

Although she is still technically married to Brad Pitt, it is said that Angelina has her sights set on a new union with a wealthy businessman and philanthropist in his forties. The couple, who reportedly began dating earlier this year, have been keeping their relationship under wraps. This means that Brad is completely unaware of Angelina's new romantic endeavor, let alone any plans for marriage. It appears that Angelina has deliberately chosen to keep him in the dark, with sources suggesting that she hopes he will be taken aback when he eventually discovers the truth. While this revelation may cause some unhappiness for Brad, Angelina seems unfazed by this prospect. In fact, she hasn't even informed their six children about the alleged wedding, fearing that they might inadvertently reveal the secret. This demonstrates her cunningness in managing the situation. As for the wedding itself, it is rumored that Angelina intends to hold a traditional Buddhist ceremony in Cambodia, which she considers her second home. The event will take place on a wildlife reserve and encompass traditional Cambodian attire and local cuisine at the reception. The source also revealed that Angelina plans to involve her children in various roles, such as bridesmaids and the best man. One of their children will even serve as the ring bearer, while another will handle DJ duties and bake the wedding cake. Despite these exciting details, one can only wonder what Brad's reaction will be once he learns of these developments.

Not only is a cliffhanger from “Part Four” resolved, but we finally have our first look at Diane some 9,926 days after she was first mentioned in the series premiere of Twin Peaks. The moment occurs when Albert Rosenfield (Miguel Ferrer) ducks out of a rainy, cold night and heads into a sultry bar named Max Von’s, where he comes face to face with David Lynch’s longtime go-to lead, Laura Dern. Now, if you recall, the set up to this began at the end of “Part Four”, when Gordon Cole (Lynch) told Albert that, before they move ahead with their investigation into Cooper’s reappearance in South Dakota, they need to get him in front of one specific person. When Gordon asks Albert if he still knows where this person lives, he responds, “No, but I know where she drinks,” which made me think beyond the shadow of a doubt that they were talking about Sarah Palmer (Grace Zabriskie). Nope. Turns out that Special Agent Dale Cooper’s (Kyle MacLachlan) secretary, who until now has only been seen in the form of a tape recorder, enjoys a cocktail or two herself. But, let’s back up a bit, because there’s a lot to piece together here, including some newly recovered diary pages, which we’ll certainly touch upon.. “Part Six” opens where “Part Five” closed, with an increasingly bewildered Cooper standing near the cowboy statue outside the office complex that houses his workplace, Lucky 7 Insurance. A policeman patrolling the area attempts to shoo him away, but Cooper is unresponsive, tugging at the sleeve of his jacket and reaching out to touch the officer’s badge as if he’s two hours into an acid trip. The cop is nice enough to drive him home and his wife Janey (Naomi Watts) opens the door and confirms it’s her husband. Granted, the fact that she uses her husband’s full name — “That’s my husband, Dougie Jones” — is a bit odd, but the officers don’t appear phased in the slightest, likely because the night itself has been odd to say the least. Soon enough, Janey brings Cooper into the house and makes him a sandwich and even gives him a little bag of chips like he’s a child. She then insists that he go upstairs to say goodnight to his (would-be) son Sonny Jim (Pierce Gagnon), to which Cooper bumbles his way up each step and eventually sits on Sonny Jim’s bed, continuing to munch away on his bag of chips. In a classic case of Lynchian humor, Cooper offers a chip to Sonny Jim, who refuses it, citing his own clean teeth, and slowly places the chip on his cowboy-themed blanket. It’s all so perfectly ridiculous, and also a welcome reprieve from the madness — kind of like the daytime scenes in a horror movie. It doesn’t last long. Almost immediately, Janey screams for Dougie/Cooper to come back downstairs, and then shows him a file folder that had appeared on their front porch earlier, back when the cops brought him in. Inside the folder is a picture of Dougie and his sex worker pal Jade (Nafessa Williams), who he seems happy to see, saying Jade’s name out loud to an increasingly disgruntled Janey, who is sniffing and shaking like a rabid horse. Watts really shines in this role, and “Part Six” allows her to stretch her comically abrasive legs as a woman unhinged yet still in charge, a familiar archetype of Lynch’s oeuvre. As she prods her husband over Jade, Janey gets a call on their yellow kitchen phone, which is, of course, a landline because, again, what is time? It’s hard to hear exactly who’s on the other end, but Janey quickly lets us know it’s the thugs looking to collect on Dougie’s gambling debt, which has led to over $20,000 in debt. Because she’s all kinds of resilient — could you imagine running that household? — Janey agrees to meet the thugs in a nearby park at “noon 30.” It’s another strange detail that’s so oddly funny.

Inside the folder is a picture of Dougie and his sex worker pal Jade (Nafessa Williams), who he seems happy to see, saying Jade’s name out loud to an increasingly disgruntled Janey, who is sniffing and shaking like a rabid horse. Watts really shines in this role, and “Part Six” allows her to stretch her comically abrasive legs as a woman unhinged yet still in charge, a familiar archetype of Lynch’s oeuvre. As she prods her husband over Jade, Janey gets a call on their yellow kitchen phone, which is, of course, a landline because, again, what is time? It’s hard to hear exactly who’s on the other end, but Janey quickly lets us know it’s the thugs looking to collect on Dougie’s gambling debt, which has led to over $20,000 in debt. Because she’s all kinds of resilient — could you imagine running that household? — Janey agrees to meet the thugs in a nearby park at “noon 30.” It’s another strange detail that’s so oddly funny. Following this, Janey implores Dougie/Cooper to finish his work, lest he lose his job, and leaves him with his case files. Before he attends to his work, however, Cooper looks over to see a flash message from MIKE (Al Strobel), who’s in the Red Room of the Black Lodge and feeling around in the air with his one arm as though he’s looking for a hidden window. When he sees Cooper, he pleads, “You have to wake up! You have to wake up!” and then, after a beat, he insists: “Don’t die! Don’t die!” The significance of this scene is to remind us, in case we forgot, that Cooper is trapped in the life of Dougie Jones, so that Cooper’s evil doppelgänger can remain on the loose in this time shifting earthy realm. If Cooper dies, then Evil Cooper, still under the influence of the parasitic Bob, will have free reign. After receiving this message from MIKE, Cooper goes through the claim forms he brought home from work and scribbles all over them with a pencil. He circles some things, draws what looks like a ladder, and then presses the tip of his pencil into a few heavy circles. As he’s doing this, pin points of green laser light — yes, the same green laser light that ousted Tom Sizemore’s character in “Part Five” — appear on the pages, and on his arm, as though it’s guiding what he’s doing. Now, comes the aforementioned moment, when Albert makes his way in the rain to meet someone at a place called Max Von’s Bar, whose sign looks a hell of a lot like the neon Bang Bar Bar sign hung outside of the Roadhouse in Twin Peaks. (By the way, I’ll now take a few personal liberties in saying that I really wish other"

gossipcop-2892576573,"There’s reportedly trouble in paradise at the Kardashian West house. Kim’s allegedly ready to divorce Kanye! What happened?  This is so sad! Kim Kardashian, 37, is reportedly at her wits end when it comes to dealing with husband Kanye West, 40. She’s struggled since Kanye’s terrifying November 2016 breakdown, and she reportedly can’t see a light at the end of the tunnel, according to an insider who spoke to Star Magazine. “Between his raging ego and mood swings, Kanye has been a total train wreck,” the insider alleged to the Star. “Kim is stressed enough raising two kids and getting ready for the baby without Kanye dragging her down. She’s tried to hang in there, but she just can’t take it anymore.”  Poor Kim! We can’t imagine how hard it must be to have a family member — especially your husband — go through such a huge health scare. Of course she’s stressed! If they’re truly divorcing, things are about to get crazy. She allegedly doesn’t want to make any moves until after their third baby, which they’re having via surrogate, is born. As the source says, she’s totally fine raising the little one as a single mother. She’s Kim effing Kardashian!  “[Their divorce] will be all-out war,” the insider told Star. Kim has reportedly asked Kanye to sign a “mid-nuptial agreement” to protect her assets. Factoring in their revenue, from Kanye’s music, the KUWTK empire, and Kim’s various deals, including KKW beauty, it could be a $1 billion divorce!  Don’t think she’s happy about this, though. “This decision is agony for her,” the source said. “She still loves Kanye, but their marriage may be over!” This is so sad, considering what we just learned from a source. Kim and Kanye were happily including daughter North West in the conversation about her new little sister, the source told us EXCLUSIVELY. If they’re truly having problems, then at least they’re putting on a united front for their little ones.  HollywoodLife.com has reached out to Kim’s rep for comment.

HollywoodLifers, do you think Kim and Kanye are really divorcing? Let us know!","Kim Kardashian, esteemed public figure, is said to be facing a challenging situation within her marital home alongside husband Kanye West. Reliable sources have revealed that Kim has been grappling with the aftermath of Kanye's distressing breakdown in November 2016, causing her considerable distress. In light of these difficulties, it is reported that Kim is unable to perceive a resolution to their challenges, as shared by an individual familiar with the matter in an interview with Star Magazine. According to this insider, Kanye's audacious self-importance and unpredictable mood swings have created an overwhelming burden for Kim, who is already encompassed by the responsibilities of raising their two children and preparing for the arrival of their third via a surrogate. Despite her efforts to endure these tribulations, Kim's emotional and mental well-being has reached its limit, rendering her unable to continue. The toll of witnessing a loved one, especially one's spouse, endure such a profound health crisis is unimaginable. Kim's current state of stress may intensify if the reports of an impending divorce prove to be veracious. However, it has been purported that Kim intends to postpone any firm decisions until after the birth of their third child. As stated by the source, should the separation become inevitable, Kim is prepared to raise their newborn as a single parent, confident in her ability to provide adequate care. It is disheartening to contemplate the possible consequences of this dissolution, as the source predicts a tumultuous legal battle to ensue, potentially resulting in a financially significant divorce of up to one billion dollars. Regrettably, this decision weighs heavily upon Kim's heart, as disclosed by the insider. Despite the impending separation, a recent source has disclosed that Kim and Kanye have maintained an appearance of unity by including their daughter, North West, in discussions concerning her anticipated younger sister. HollywoodLife.com has extended inquiries to Kim's representative for further clarification on this matter. Dear readers, we invite you to share your thoughts on whether you believe that Kim and Kanye are indeed on the path to divorce."

After much anticipation and speculation, Seacrest, who served as host of the talent competition show during its initial 15-season run that ended in April 2016, confirmed the news on “Live with Kelly and Ryan” Thursday morning.  “Is it OK if I announce this big news?” talk show host Kelly Ripa asked Seacrest, who was seated next to her. “I’ve been waiting and waiting.”  With a nod from Seacrest, Ripa said, “We’ve been talking about it for a little while, but I am happy to confirm ... that Ryan Seacrest is returning as the host of ‘American Idol,’” prompting cheers from the studio audience.

On Oct. 23, 2017, the Los Angeles Times published a report, claiming that screenwriter and director James Toback had sexually harassed at least 38 women (via The Washington Post). According to the exposé, Toback would often explain his Hollywood reputation to women he'd meet on the street, offering them a chance to be in his next film. Then, he'd allegedly bring them to his hotel room and ask them questions about their sex lives. Some of his accusers claim he'd then rub his groin against their legs or start masturbating in front of them.  Toback, 72, has denied these allegations, stating that he'd never met the women or, if he had, he couldn't remember their interactions because their meeting ""was for five minutes."" He also claimed that it'd be ""biologically impossible"" for him to have engaged in such behavior due to the medication he was taking for both diabetes and a heart condition.  It appears that many celebrities had heard rumors of Toback's alleged behavior over the years, and, as such, they wasted no time in slamming the Bugsy writer after the Los Angeles Times article was published.  ""The damn has broke. Women will no longer be silent. We have your back and will amplify,"" actress Debra Messing wrote.  ""One of the main jobs of a director is to create a safe environment for the actors. James Toback is a disgrace,"" Bridesmaids director Paul Feig tweeted.

It has been a year since I last spoke to Kim."" 

Although Kardashian West had publicly expressed support for Jenner's personal journey, she decided to sever ties after reading the memoir. The book made claims that Kris Jenner, Caitlyn's ex-wife and Kim's mother, possessed a deeper understanding of Caitlyn's struggle with gender identity than she has previously acknowledged. Consequently, this led to a rupture in their relationship. 

In an episode of the popular reality show KUWTK, the highly successful entrepreneur behind KKW Beauty, Kim Kardashian West, also revealed the emotional impact the memoir had on her. Specifically, she expressed hurt over a chapter in which Jenner suggested that her late father, Robert Kardashian, believed O.J. Simpson was guilty of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. This conclusion was reached despite her father's role as O.J. Simpson's defense attorney during the infamous 1994 murder trial. 

During the episode, which aired in October of the same year, Kardashian West shared her strained relationship with Caitlyn. She emphasized her intention to remain respectful but warned, ""If you speak ill of my dad, I will sever ties with you."" 

Despite their current estrangement, in April of the prior year, Kardashian West assured Ellen Degeneres during an interview that she would always cherish her love for Caitlyn for her role in raising her and her siblings."
gossipcop-906572,"Applicants during ABC's ""The Bachelor"" casting call at McCormick Ranch in Scottsdale on June 16, 2018. (Photo: Patrick Breen/The Republic) For a show that feeds on exposing private affairs and personal heartbreak, the application process for ABC's ""The Bachelor"" doesn't begin to scratch the surface. Phoenix, along with 15 other cities, was chosen as a casting call site for season 23 of the hit reality-TV dating show. I volunteered to brave the high heels and nervous laughs to see what deep, personal secrets the show would be fishing for. As a full disclaimer: I’m a fan of the show. I closely watched the last season, which featured Scottsdale ""Bachelor"" Arie Luyendyk Jr. Not only is he probably the most-hated man in franchise history, but he gave a dismal showing of his hometown on America’s TV screens every Monday night. Scottsdale turned into a place to go bowling and reminisce on the old days. Nevermind that Luyendyk actually grew up in Paradise Valley. While that season was a bit of a letdown, I didn’t let it shift my belief in the process. The show, now with more spinoffs to keep track of, has captivated audiences season after season, following young hopefuls searching for love. Was I looking for love? Absolutely not. Not quite like this, at least. But I had to believe there were some women auditioning in the hopes of finding their forever life partner on a reality show. What's in an application Arizona Republic reporter Rebecca Smouse poses for a photograph prior to auditioning for ABC's ""The Bachelor"" at McCormick Ranch in Scottsdale on June 16, 2018. (Photo: Elizabeth Montgomery/The Republic) I quickly befriended a young woman in the parking lot of The Scottsdale Resort at McCormick Ranch. We both had recently graduated from Arizona State University and decided to stick together through this journey. Following the trail of nicely dressed women, we wandered into a large ballroom to find what seemed like organized chaos. We were handed an application, a clipboard and a number. I was No. 72. A woman at the applications table said she expected about 200 people to filter through the resort by the end of the day. Phoenix has been a frequent destination for the show's casting calls, though few women from the Valley have been in recent seasons. Everything felt like a test. Candy placed on the application table? Avoid that. The ballroom, equipped with a DJ and an open bar, was decorated with women of all ages. Many were dressed to the nines, wearing beautiful dresses, tight fabrics and high heels. My parking-lot friend fit that description, dressed in a tube top and matching skirt with heels much taller than I could ever walk in. I was wearing a matching top-and-bottom set with bright boots and some accent jewelry. I wore an outfit that I felt matched my personality without trying too hard. Others arrived more simply in jeans and T-shirts. A young woman was dressed in a cow costume, clad with sparkly silver shoes, a bold move the producers would either applaud or completely dismiss. Angelie Meehan, of Phoenix, wears a cow costume to her audition for ABC's ""The Bachelor"" at McCormick Ranch in Scottsdale on June 16, 2018.

(Photo: Patrick Breen/The Republic) For a show that feeds on exposing private affairs and personal heartbreak, the application process for ABC's ""The Bachelor"" doesn't begin to scratch the surface. Phoenix, along with 15 other cities, was chosen as a casting call site for season 23 of the hit reality-TV dating show. I volunteered to brave the high heels and nervous laughs to see what deep, personal secrets the show would be fishing for. As a full disclaimer: I’m a fan of the show. I closely watched the last season, which featured Scottsdale ""Bachelor"" Arie Luyendyk Jr. Not only is he probably the most-hated man in franchise history, but he gave a dismal showing of his hometown on America’s TV screens every Monday night. Scottsdale turned into a place to go bowling and reminisce on the old days. Nevermind that Luyendyk actually grew up in Paradise Valley. While that season was a bit of a letdown, I didn’t let it shift my belief in the process. The show, now with more spinoffs to keep track of, has captivated audiences season after season, following young hopefuls searching for love. Was I looking for love? Absolutely not. Not quite like this, at least. But I had to believe there were some women auditioning in the hopes of finding their forever life partner on a reality show. What's in an application Arizona Republic reporter Rebecca Smouse poses for a photograph prior to auditioning for ABC's ""The Bachelor"" at McCormick Ranch in Scottsdale on June 16, 2018. (Photo: Elizabeth Montgomery/The Republic) I quickly befriended a young woman in the parking lot of The Scottsdale Resort at McCormick Ranch. We both had recently graduated from Arizona State University and decided to stick together through this journey. Following the trail of nicely dressed women, we wandered into a large ballroom to find what seemed like organized chaos. We were handed an application, a clipboard and a number. I was No. 72. A woman at the applications table said she expected about 200 people to filter through the resort by the end of the day. Phoenix has been a frequent destination for the show's casting calls, though few women from the Valley have been in recent seasons. Everything felt like a test. Candy placed on the application table? Avoid that. The ballroom, equipped with a DJ and an open bar, was decorated with women of all ages. Many were dressed to the nines, wearing beautiful dresses, tight fabrics and high heels. My parking-lot friend fit that description, dressed in a tube top and matching skirt with heels much taller than I could ever walk in. I was wearing a matching top-and-bottom set with bright boots and some accent jewelry. I wore an outfit that I felt matched my personality without trying too hard. Others arrived more simply in jeans and T-shirts. A young woman was dressed in a cow costume, clad with sparkly silver shoes, a bold move the producers would either applaud or completely dismiss. Angelie Meehan, of Phoenix, wears a cow costume to her audition for ABC's ""The Bachelor"" at McCormick Ranch in Scottsdale on June 16, 2018. She said she was looking for ""that special bull for her life.""

What have you not found yet but would like in a relationship? There were also several questions on prior relationships and marriages. The application explicitly asked if we drank alcohol, only to follow up with the next logical question: What's your favorite drink? My newfound friend had issues with some of the questions, like what our salary was and what was on our bucket list. We both skipped the question asking if we had any interesting talents. The application was coupled with an intense release to agree to everything the producers may do if you get picked for the show. It felt like we were signing our life away, a thought that resonated with many of the applicants sitting around us. All in the name of love, though. Interestingly enough, most people I spoke with who were auditioning had not watched the show before. It seemed strange to me to audition for a process they had never seen on TV before. This would be like someone trying out for ""Survivor"" not knowing you will be trapped on a deserted island. To make it on the show, you must be 21 or older, be single and can't have been convicted of a felony. You also can't be running for any type of political office.

(Photo: Patrick Breen/The Republic) After quite a bit of sitting and waiting, we stood in another line, had a few photos snapped and then were shuffled from the grand ballroom into smaller conference rooms, greeted by a small camcorder and an interviewer. We sat as a small group outside, waiting for our names to be called. I made a new friend, who told me she reluctantly agreed to audition after a friend worried about her love life drove her to the resort. She said her friend even tweeted photos to the producers of the show to get their attention. The empty room was daunting, but the woman behind the camera was kind. She'd been through her fair share of casting calls before"

Anderson Cooper speaks with women who worked at the Spotted Pig, where Batali was an investor and allegedly groped staffers as a diner there.

She later called a crisis hotline and went to a hospital to be examined, but ultimately, she chose not to file a police report. Batali denied the incident.

She told NYPD that she had been drinking at Babbo in January 2004 and then blacked out; when she awakened, Batali was having sex with her, the complain said. She believes she was drugged. That investigation is also ongoing.  Batali stepped away from his Italian restaurant empire in late 2017 after allegations that he inappropriately touched women over the course of his decades-long career. At the time, he admitted that “much of the behavior described does, in fact, match up with ways I have acted.”  Batali and Bastianich Hospitality Group issued a statement saying that the other partners did not know about the allegations made public on Sunday night, calling them “chilling and deeply disturbing.” The company also noted that the terms of Batali’s divestment from two dozen restaurants across the country will finalize on July 1.  This post has been updated to include a statement from B&B, new information from NYPD, and a newly reported incident."

There is a strong chance a friend will be lost.  Diana Falzone  More Kim Kardashian and Beyonce Feud","The longevity of Kimye's relationship may be called into question if Kanye's close friends, Jay-Z and Beyonce, continue to distance themselves from Kim. This was made evident during the recent BET awards, where Jay-Z seemed to barely acknowledge Kim while accepting his award alongside Kanye. As important collaborators and intimate friends, Jay-Z's stance on Kim could potentially affect the couple's future. 

Regrettably, Kim cannot control whether or not Kanye's friends like her. It falls upon Kanye to assert boundaries with his buddies and make it clear that treating his girlfriend poorly is unacceptable. If his friends persist in rejecting Kim, Kanye may have to distance himself from them until they recognize that he and Kim are a package deal. 

It is crucial to acknowledge that Jay-Z and Beyonce may have preconceived notions about Kim and the Kardashian family, without truly knowing her as an individual. If they are able to discard their judgmental lenses, there is a possibility that they could develop a liking or, at the very least, a tolerance for her presence within their social circle. 

It is important to remember that when a friend finds happiness with a new partner, it is essential to refrain from harboring negativity. There is a strong likelihood that friendships may be compromised in the process.

It wasn’t so bad on the scale of celebrity breakups, but after less than three years of marriage (a lifetime in Hollywood), it was a tabloid downer for a day or two.  In case there are still people busying themselves wondering if Aniston is happy (just a note, she really doesn’t want you to), please stop. According to the latest tabloid reports, she’s doing just fine. She’s reportedly back on the dating scene with two different beaus, per Us Weekly, and her friends are having trouble not talking about it. One man is reportedly a bachelor who recently split from his wife and the other is an “industry creative,” whatever that ever means. Neither of them is an actor.  But there’s no reason to believe we’ll learn more anytime soon. In July of 2016, Aniston wrote a pretty searing op-ed for HuffPost in which she scolded paparazzi that are constantly obsessed with whether she’s in love or having babies.  “For the record, I am not pregnant,” she wrote then. “What I am is fed up. I’m fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body-shaming that occurs daily under the guise of ‘journalism,’ the ‘First Amendment,’ and ‘celebrity news.’”  O.K., so, Jennifer Aniston is happy.

E-mail Address Subscribe","Following the public announcement of Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux's separation, which coincided with the release of an Architectural Digest feature showcasing their stunning midcentury home in Los Angeles, the news generated interest but did not reach the magnitude of other celebrity breakups. The couple's marriage, that lasted less than three years, a significant duration in the Hollywood industry, received attention from tabloids for a brief period. 

However, for those still pondering over Aniston's happiness, it is imperative to respect her wish for privacy. Reputable sources, including Us Weekly, reveal that she has moved on and is currently exploring new romantic connections with two individuals. Notably, neither of them is from the acting profession. One gentleman is reported to be a recently divorced bachelor, while the other is described as an ""industry creative,"" although the exact nature of their profession remains undisclosed.

Nevertheless, it is unlikely that further details will be revealed in the near future. Back in July 2016, Aniston expressed her exasperation in a powerful op-ed for HuffPost, addressing the invasive nature of the paparazzi and the incessant focus on her personal life, love affairs, and potential motherhood. In her own words, she firmly stated, ""For the record, I am not pregnant. What I am is fed up. I'm fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body-shaming that occurs daily under the guise of 'journalism,' the 'First Amendment,' and 'celebrity news.'""

Therefore, the latest developments indicate that Jennifer Aniston is content and actively dating, which is undoubtedly positive news. It is now crucial to respect her privacy and shift our attention to discussing other topics, such as Justin Theroux's acquaintances in the South of France, particularly someone with an exceptional hot tub.

Palvin took to Twitter, confirming that there was nothing going on between her and Bieber. photography via instagram.com/ashilrd January 2013: The pair are reportedly back together; Gomez travels to Norway to visit Bieber They clearly can’t stay away from one another for long.

Photography via Instagram.com/selenagomez August 2016: Gomez posts a clip of her singing “Let Me Love You” So, just when we thought the dust had settled between Jelena, this clip surfaced of Gomez singing DJ Snake’s “Let Me Love You,” which features the Biebs on vocals. An official cover has yet to be released; however, suspicions that it’s coming soon have been heightened as DJ Snake posted a longer version of Gomez’s cover on his Snapchat. I think we can all agree that it’s a little odd of Selena to chose to cover her ex’s song after feuding over his new boo Sofia. But hey, you do you, Selena! photography via instagram.com/revivaltour November 2016: Bieber allegedly visits Gomez in rehab Gomez pulled out of her Revival Tour, in late August, due to complications caused by Lupus; mainly symptoms surrounding anxiety and panic.

Relationships can be tumultuous, and when it comes to the romance between Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez, it's been seven years of ups and downs. These two young stars captured the hearts of their fan bases and sparked the iconic #Jelena hashtag. Given their immense fame, their admirers range from loyal supporters to fanatical devotees. Tracking their relationship can be quite challenging, but fear not, as we have meticulously dissected every breakup and reconciliation. Take a seat and get comfortable, because there is a lot to delve into.

In January 2011, the dating rumors surrounding Bieber and Gomez began to circulate. By that same month, the pop stars confirmed their romance with a display of public affection during a vacation in St. Lucia. Their love story was further solidified when they walked the red carpet together for the first time at the Vanity Fair Oscars party in February 2011. Their youthful adoration was on full display at the Billboard Music Awards in May 2011.

Rumors started to circulate in November 2011, suggesting that Gomez had ended the relationship. These rumors stemmed from a Bieber fan's claim that she had slept with him backstage at a show and that he was the father of her child. However, these speculations were eventually debunked. It wasn't until November 2012 that the couple officially broke up, with Bieber briefly being linked to model Barbara Palvin. But don't worry, this was just the first of many breakups.

In January 2013, less than three months after their initial split, Bieber posted a photo of him and Gomez on his Instagram, signaling a possible reconciliation. However, the image was swiftly deleted, leaving fans guessing. At the American Music Awards in November 2014, Gomez performed her single ""The Heart Wants What It Wants"" and openly confirmed that it was about Bieber. The couple made a few more on-again, off-again appearances in the media before officially calling it quits.

In December 2014, Bieber denied dating rumors with model Hailey Baldwin, leading to the rise of the ""Jailey"" ship. Around the same time, Gomez sparked dating rumors with DJ Zedd in January 2015. In September 2015, she opened up about her past relationship with Bieber, expressing her continued support for him. Bieber himself acknowledged their history when he appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in November 2015, revealing which songs from his album Purpose were inspired by Selena.

The roller-coaster continued in January 2016 with Bieber and Baldwin spending New Year's Eve together. However, their romance was short-lived, and they eventually broke up. In August 2016, Bieber was seen with Sofia Richie, and Gomez posted a clip of her singing DJ Snake's ""Let Me Love You,"" a song that features Bieber. Confusion arose, considering her recent feud with Richie, but Gomez's actions remained her own.

November 2016 brought rumors of Bieber visiting Gomez in rehab. Gomez had pulled out of her Revival Tour earlier that year due to complications from Lupus, resulting in anxiety and panic. Meanwhile, in January 2017, Gomez was spotted with Canadian singer The Weeknd, indicating a new chapter in her love life.

The saga of Jelena, as it has come to be known, might be reaching its conclusion. However, with these two celebrities, anything is possible. Only time will tell what the future holds for Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez."
gossipcop-2388806885,"R. Kelly’s time may have finally come. R. Kelly has been accused of sexual relationships with minors going back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah. (The marriage was annulled.) In the 24 years since then, he has been sued multiple times for inappropriate sexual contact with a minor (he settled out of court every time), and he was eventually charged with creating child pornography. (A jury found him not guilty on the grounds that they could not conclusively identify the other figure in his infamous sex tape as a child.) Last summer, he was accused of creating an abusive “sex cult” of very young women, whom he allegedly isolates, brainwashes, and abuses physically and emotionally. Since the story broke, multiple women have added their own testimonies of abuse at R. Kelly’s hands. (Through a lawyer, Kelly denied all accusations, saying he would “work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.”) And in April, another woman accused Kelly of “knowingly and intentionally infecting her with an STD.” Her lawyers say they are currently preparing a federal civil lawsuit. Through a spokesperson, Kelly issued a statement to the Washington Post in which he “categorically denies all claims and allegations.” As man after man has fallen to the #MeToo reckoning, losing jobs and retiring from public life after being accused of sexual harassment and assault, there’s been a recurring whisper: What about R. Kelly? Despite decades of lawsuits and allegations, Kelly’s career has marched steadily on. Last year, he finished an arena tour with a few cancellations. This year, he’s touring with singer Charlie Wilson (some protests are planned). His music appeared in Pitch Perfect 3. At this year’s Coachella, rapper Vince Staples repeatedly referred to Kelly as a “child molester” in an interview with Complex, insisting, “He pees on people.” In our post-#MeToo, post-Time’s Up, post-Harvey Weinstein world, and given the sheer volume of allegations against Kelly, it seems reasonable to raise the question of why he continues to work as much as he does. But Staples’s interviewer only giggled nervously and protested, “We can’t ever talk about this guy. ... You’re about to get me fired from Coachella. It’s my first time here.” Later, Staples tweeted that “R.

But if that’s the case, those consequences took more than two decades to reach him. There is a persistent vagueness to the way we talk about R. Kelly that makes it possible to forget exactly what he’s been accused of, how often he’s been accused, and how much proof there is against him. And most likely, that’s because his alleged victims are overwhelmingly young black women and hence apparently easy for America to ignore. “The saddest fact I’ve learned is: Nobody matters less to our society than young black women,” says Jim DeRogatis, the reporter who broke the R. Kelly story. “Nobody.” To try to combat that vagueness and the erasure that it makes possible, here is a timeline of all of the accusations of sexual misconduct against R. Kelly. Much of the chronology here is drawn from DeRogatis’s invaluable coverage of the R. Kelly accusations, including his own immensely thorough timeline. DeRogatis’s timeline covers the entire span of Kelly’s life, including his major career milestones and unrelated legal issues, but I’ve narrowed the focus of this timeline to specifically the sexual misconduct accusations against Kelly. Over the 24-year span of this timeline, a consistent pattern emerges. Over and over again, Kelly is accused of the same behavior: of targeting girls and very young women, isolating them, and controlling and abusing them. And after the dust from the accusation settles, Kelly goes on living his life with very few changes. Here, from Aaliyah to the alleged sex cult, are all the R. Kelly accusations. August 30, 1994: 27-year-old R. Kelly marries 15-year-old Aaliyah The ’90s music sensation Aaliyah was Kelly’s protégé. They met when she was 12 years old, and Kelly wrote and produced her first album in 1993. It was titled Age Ain’t Nothing but a Number. In 1995, Vibe magazine published a copy of their marriage license, with 15-year-old Aaliyah falsely listing her age as 18. “Family members say Aaliyah thought it was all an elaborate ‘game,’ and she just went along with it,” the Chicago Sun-Times later reported, adding that the marriage license was reportedly obtained by Kelly’s assistant, using a fake ID. “Within hours, she realized what had happened, and she went to her family and sought their help.” The marriage was annulled in 1994, just months after the ceremony. In the settlement, according to documents obtained by the Sun-Times, Aaliyah promises not to pursue further legal action because of “emotional distress caused","R. Kelly’s alleged misconduct, particularly in regard to sexual relationships with minors, has recently been receiving increased attention. These accusations stretch back to 1994 when he infamously married pop star Aaliyah, who was only 15 years old at the time (the marriage was later annulled). Throughout the past 24 years, Kelly has faced multiple lawsuits related to inappropriate sexual contact with minors, all of which were settled out of court. Additionally, he was charged with creating child pornography, although he was found not guilty due to discrepancies in identifying the individuals involved. Most recently, Kelly has been accused of establishing an abusive ""sex cult"" consisting of young women whom he allegedly isolates, manipulates, and abuses both physically and emotionally.

Since these allegations came to light, several women have added their own testimonies of abuse at the hands of R. Kelly. Kelly, through his lawyer, has denied all the accusations, vowing to clear his name by diligently pursuing his accusers. In April, another woman came forward claiming that Kelly intentionally infected her with a sexually transmitted disease, and her legal team is currently preparing a federal civil lawsuit. Kelly, however, has categorically denied these claims as well.

With the ongoing #MeToo movement and the increased awareness surrounding sexual misconduct, it is natural to question why R. Kelly's career has remained relatively unaffected despite decades of lawsuits and allegations. While many high-profile individuals have faced significant consequences for their actions, such as losing their jobs or retiring from public life, Kelly's career has continued to thrive. He completed an arena tour last year, albeit with a few cancellations, and is currently touring with singer Charlie Wilson, albeit with planned protests. Furthermore, his music recently appeared in the film Pitch Perfect 3. Rapper Vince Staples even publicly referred to Kelly as a ""child molester"" during an interview, but the subject was avoided and brushed off.

However, there are signs that this stasis may finally be changing for R. Kelly. The BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes, brought renewed attention to the allegations against him. Moreover, several members of his inner circle, including his assistant, accountant, lawyer, and representative, have publicly distanced themselves from him, suggesting that his alleged misconduct played a role in their departures. DJ Phantom, his longtime musical accompanist, was particularly candid in his departure, expressing regret for not realizing the truth sooner and describing Kelly as a ""shitbag.""

In April, the Women of Color committee within Time's Up endorsed the #MuteRKelly campaign, urging companies like Spotify, Ticketmaster, and RCA to sever ties with Kelly. Spotify responded by announcing that they would no longer promote his music, though it would still be available on their streaming platform. These recent developments indicate that R. Kelly may finally face lasting consequences for his alleged actions, although it took more than two decades for this to occur.

To combat the vagueness and erasure surrounding R. Kelly's accusations, it is crucial to provide a comprehensive timeline of his alleged sexual misconduct. This includes his marriage to Aaliyah in 1994, the subsequent accusations heard through the years, and his recent involvement in the alleged sex cult. By shedding light on this timeline, it becomes apparent that one consistent pattern emerges: Kelly is repeatedly accused of targeting young girls and women, controlling and abusing them, and then continuing with his life relatively unscathed once the dust settles. It is troubling to observe that his alleged victims, who are predominately young black women, appear to be overlooked by American society.

In conclusion, the numerous accusations and evidence against R. Kelly paint a disturbing picture of his alleged misconduct. While it has taken a considerable amount of time for the consequences to catch up with him, recent developments suggest that change might finally be on the horizon. However, it is essential to remember the individuals who have come forward and bravely shared their stories, as they highlight the urgent need for accountability and justice in cases of sexual misconduct."

And although I can navigate Hollywood and I love the business and the opportunities it’s afforded me, I also understand what it’s like not to have all that.”  Wahlberg’s point is well taken.

What makes Hollywood liberals qualified to speak on politics? They should have respect for the President of the United States.  Do you agree?","Mark Wahlberg, renowned actor and star of the recent movie ""Patriots Day,"" has shared a thoughtful message with respect to fellow celebrities who publicly criticized Donald Trump in the lead-up to the 2016 election. Speaking in an interview with Task & Purpose, Wahlberg expressed his belief that many celebrities should refrain from engaging in such political discourse. 

In his own words, Wahlberg highlighted the limited impact that celebrity opinions have on the general public, stating, ""You know, it just goes to show you that people aren't listening to that anyways. They might buy your CD or watch your movie, but you don't put food on their table. You don't pay their bills."" Drawing attention to the potential disconnect between Hollywood and the average citizen, he emphasized the importance of understanding the realities faced by ordinary individuals who work tirelessly to support their families.

Wahlberg, speaking from personal experience, noted his awareness of the dichotomy between the glitz and glamour of Hollywood and the starkness of everyday life. He acknowledged his ability to navigate the complexities of the entertainment industry while remaining grounded in the real world, humbly recalling his own journey from relatively modest circumstances. The actor aptly calls upon his peers to consider their privileges and the potential isolation that comes with living in what he refers to as a ""bubble.""

Wahlberg raises a valid point regarding the suitability of Hollywood liberals as political commentators. He advocates for a respectful approach towards the President of the United States, arguing that those in the entertainment industry should exercise caution when expressing their political beliefs. By extending this plea, Wahlberg encourages celebrities to foster a climate of consideration and respect, recognizing the significance of their platforms and how their words can contribute to public discourse.

It is worth considering Wahlberg's perspective on this matter. What qualifications truly make Hollywood liberals authoritative figures in political discussions? In the interest of maintaining a respectful discourse, should there not be an appropriate level of regard for the elected President of the United States?"

GWYNETH PALTROW: I was trying to remember when we first met, but I’m afraid I can’t.  PENÉLOPE CRUZ: We had lunch at Madeo in Los Angeles. We were alone and talking about our deepest secrets, as if we had known each other for 20 years. It was around the time I was doing All the Pretty Horses [2000].  PALTROW: Wow. We’ve been friends for a long time. We’ve been through so much together.  CRUZ: And even though we live so far away and don’t spend nearly enough time together, when I see you, it’s like it was only yesterday.  PALTROW: I was thinking the other day about how you used to study dance. Was your goal to become â¨a ballerina?  CRUZ: That’s what I wanted as a little girl. By the time I went to ballet school at age 4, I was already asking to play the role of Carmen. I didn’t realize then that the reason I liked dancing was because it was just another form of acting. I was hard-core, training something like five hours a day, six days a week. But when I did my first movie, when I was around 17, I just fell in love with acting. That’s when I stopped dancing.  PALTROW: Do you miss it?  CRUZ: I miss the freedom I felt when I was dancing. I remember it as some kind of trance. I imagine singing is like that for you. You have such an amazing voice.  PALTROW: It’s totally like that. How did you get your first job?  CRUZ: I got an agent when I was 15, and she sent me to a casting for Jamón Jamón [1992]. And I got the job. For both Javier and I, that was the movie that actually started both our careers.  PALTROW: You were 17 when you did that?  CRUZ: I think I was, but I was lying so much about my age that I can’t be sure.  PALTROW: Most actresses try to make themselves younger, but you were making yourself older.  CRUZ: I’ve spent most of my career trying to make myself older, for different reasons. Journalists have been asking me, since I was, like, 22, “Are you afraid of aging?” That is such a crazy question for a 22-year-old girl or, for that matter, for a 42-year-old. I combat that craziness by refusing to answer the question.  PALTROW: It’s amazing, Hollywood’s obsession with the aging of women. And how much scrutiny we get for being whatever age we are.  CRUZ: My mom worked very hard to raise us, as did my dad, without bullshit. I’ve always had a real sense of rootedness in family and reality. It’s not like I’m proud of the values I have, because I don’t feel like they’re up to me—they just come from the way I was raised. I’m rooted by the things I’ve seen in my mom, the things I admire in her. And in my father. When it comes to talking about aging as an actress, I feel like, “What the fuck? I’m not going to give you even two minutes to honor your question. It doesn’t deserve that.” Something changed when I gave birth to my daughter. I started thinking, “Come on, it’s 2017. Why do women still have to be talking about this?

I was hard-core, training something like five hours a day, six days a week. But when I did my first movie, when I was around 17, I just fell in love with acting. That’s when I stopped dancing.  PALTROW: Do you miss it?  CRUZ: I miss the freedom I felt when I was dancing. I remember it as some kind of trance. I imagine singing is like that for you. You have such an amazing voice.  PALTROW: It’s totally like that. How did you get your first job?  CRUZ: I got an agent when I was 15, and she sent me to a casting for Jamón Jamón [1992]. And I got the job. For both Javier and I, that was the movie that actually started both our careers.  PALTROW: You were 17 when you did that?  CRUZ: I think I was, but I was lying so much about my age that I can’t be sure.  PALTROW: Most actresses try to make themselves younger, but you were making yourself older.  CRUZ: I’ve spent most of my career trying to make myself older, for different reasons. Journalists have been asking me, since I was, like, 22, “Are you afraid of aging?” That is such a crazy question for a 22-year-old girl or, for that matter, for a 42-year-old. I combat that craziness by refusing to answer the question.  PALTROW: It’s amazing, Hollywood’s obsession with the aging of women. And how much scrutiny we get for being whatever age we are.  CRUZ: My mom worked very hard to raise us, as did my dad, without bullshit. I’ve always had a real sense of rootedness in family and reality. It’s not like I’m proud of the values I have, because I don’t feel like they’re up to me—they just come from the way I was raised. I’m rooted by the things I’ve seen in my mom, the things I admire in her. And in my father. When it comes to talking about aging as an actress, I feel like, “What the fuck? I’m not going to give you even two minutes to honor your question. It doesn’t deserve that.” Something changed when I gave birth to my daughter. I started thinking, “Come on, it’s 2017. Why do women still have to be talking about this? It’s crazy.” That sense only got bigger when I had children."

Ailes resigned from his post leading Fox News last July, amid allegations of sexual harassment. He was 77.  Ailes helped found Fox News in 1996. On Thursday, the network initially announced his death by citing the Drudge Report, which had published a statement from Ailes' wife, Elizabeth.  According to Fox News, that statement reads:  ""I am profoundly sad and heartbroken to report that my husband, Roger Ailes, passed away this morning. Roger was a loving husband to me, to his son Zachary, and a loyal friend to many. He was also a patriot, profoundly grateful to live in a country that gave him so much opportunity to work hard, to rise — and to give back.""  Remembrances Roger Ailes, Founder Of 'Fox News,' Dies At 77 Roger Ailes, Founder Of 'Fox News,' Dies At 77 Listen · 4:36 4:36  Anchors of the channel's morning show Fox & Friends were noticeably emotional in announcing Ailes' death.  ""Beth, you are in our thoughts and prayers,"" co-host Ainsley Earhardt said, ""and so is Zachary, their beautiful son. Roger, rest in peace.""  Ailes was famous for his shrewd leadership of Fox, including his focus on airing conservative opinions and hiring anchors and reporters with big personalities. But he left Fox with a tarnished legacy, facing legal actions over allegations of sexual harassment.  Ailes denied accusations that he built a culture at Fox that encouraged harassment, after a lawsuit by former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson prompted other women at the network, including high-profile anchor Megyn Kelly, to step forward with similar claims. He abruptly resigned last July.  In the decades before he created a ratings juggernaut in Fox News, Ailes worked in politics, serving as a media adviser and consultant — most famously for Richard Nixon, whom Ailes helped to win the presidency in 1968. He later worked for other Republican leaders, from Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush to New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.  Ailes was a producer of the variety and talk program The Mike Douglas Show when he met Nixon. In the years that followed, as NPR's David Folkenflik has reported, Ailes ""kept toggling between producing television specials and serving as a political consultant, sometimes doing both at once.""  The architect of Fox News was also close to President Trump, to whom he gave a weekly slot on Fox & Friends — a show that the president has regularly touted in his tweets from the White House.  Trump ""sort of represents Roger Ailes' legacy of 50 years of using television to advance a style — a populist style of conservative politics,"" journalist and author Gabriel Sherman told NPR's Terry Gross last summer.  Sherman, who wrote a biography of Ailes titled The Loudest Voice In The Room, also spoke to Terry back in 2014, when his book was first published.  Discussing Ailes' impact on politics and culture in the U.S., Sherman said, ""One of Ailes' lasting legacies will be that for millions of Americans, news is now no longer viewed as a way to be informed about the world; it's a way of gathering information that advances your side.""",0,en,0,"Roger Ailes, Former Fox News CEO, Dies At 77  Enlarge this image toggle caption Wesley Mann/Fox News via Getty Images Wesley Mann/Fox News via Getty Images  Former Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes has died, the network says, citing a statement from the late executive's family.

gossipcop-955765,"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle ‘Found Each Other to Change the World,’ Nacho Figueras Says  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s romance is one for the ages, according to their pal Nacho Figueras. The Argentine polo star, who appeared alongside the couple at the 2018 Sentebale ISPS Handa Polo Cup on Thursday, July 26, raved about the couple on Instagram and Twitter after the match, saying their love story serves a greater purpose.  “This girl really rocks. The more I know you, the more I am convinced that you both found each other to change the world,” he captioned a photo of himself presenting a trophy to the Duchess of Sussex. “Let’s push the envelope!! Let’s make the world a better place.”  Figueras, who is also a Ralph Lauren model, was on Harry’s team — the winning team — at Thursday’s match for Sentebale, an organization founded by the Duke of Sussex and Prince Seeiso of Lesotho. Sentebale aims to “become the leading organization in the provision of psychosocial support for children living with HIV in Southern Africa,” according to its website.  Thursday’s match raised more than £1 million for the charity. “@sentebale currently reaches nearly 4,000 young people a year with our unique programme of psychosocial support, so they can live long, happy, healthy lives,” Figueras captioned another photo. On a throwback pic of himself with Harry, he added that it was “an honor to be the captain of the @stregishotels Polo Team playing with this great man for a great cause.”  Figueras made headlines earlier this week when a photo of him with the royal couple went viral and sparked a series of memes. The image showed Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan celebrating his team’s victory with a kiss, as Figueras stood next to them awkwardly, trying to hand them the trophy.  Fortunately, the athlete had a good sense of humor about the situation and even joked about being the newlyweds’ third wheel in one of his posts. “When you wished the trophy would turn into a violin,” he quipped. “What an incredible love story.”  (photos via Chris Jackson/Getty Images)",0,en,0,"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle ‘Found Each Other to Change the World,’ Nacho Figueras Says  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s romance is one for the ages, according to their pal Nacho Figueras.

Here’s how the Biebs is coping with his time apart from Sel.  Justin Bieber, 24, is going through a tough time as his relationship with Selena Gomez, 25, is on pause. She’s currently on vacation with friends in Sydney, Australia, where she appears to be carefree in this new video. However, a source reveals that the same can’t be said for Bieber. “Justin has Selena on the brain constantly. He is trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time but he keeps thinking about her,” a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “He always wants to be around her, talk to her and be with her. She is like a drug for him, he just needs more and more and more.”  As the Biebs continues to struggle with their time apart, he’s got a few things up his sleeve for when she returns to LA. “He can’t wait until she is back because he wants to really wine and dine her upon her return and really kick start the relationship back up again,” the insider reveals. It’s unclear when Sel is scheduled to return to the West Coast. But, as seen on her Instagram, she is having the time of her life. She posted a video which showed her laughing on a boat, accompanied by a subliminal message, that she “chose” to take care of herself, “not to prove anything to anyone.” Was she trying to give us insight into her most recent split with Bieber?  Jelena fans went into panic mode after seeing Sel in the arms of another man on a boat on March 19. She was photographed hugging and goofing off in photos with Sydney native, Johnny Rays. While all signs point to a friendship between the two, the photos didn’t appear that way to some fans who claimed they looked too close for comfort.  While Sel has been vacationing Down Under, Bieber has been staying active. He’s been photographed playing hockey and soccer with friends. However, his emotions may be getting the best of him as he took a gnarly fall during a soccer game on March 19, and seemingly broke down on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.  As you may recall, Jelena reunited in October 2017, after her split with The Weeknd, 28. They seemed inseparable, having spent New Year’s together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, their romance took a rocky turn around Bieber’s birthday on March 1, according to reports.",1,en,"Justin Bieber’s struggling with his split from Selena Gomez as she’s all smiles on her Australian vacation, a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.

While all signs point to a friendship between the two, the photos didn’t appear that way to some fans who claimed they looked too close for comfort.  While Sel has been vacationing Down Under, Bieber has been staying active. He’s been photographed playing hockey and soccer with friends. However, his emotions may be getting the best of him as he took a gnarly fall during a soccer game on March 19, and seemingly broke down on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.  As you may recall, Jelena reunited in October 2017, after her split with The Weeknd, 28. They seemed inseparable, having spent New Year’s together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, their romance took a rocky turn around Bieber’s birthday on March 1, according to reports.","According to an exclusive source from HollywoodLife.com, Justin Bieber is currently facing difficulties coping with the temporary pause in his relationship with Selena Gomez. While Gomez enjoys her vacation in Sydney, Australia, as depicted in a carefree video, Bieber's mind is consumed by thoughts of her. Despite his efforts to distract himself by spending time with friends and engaging in personal activities, he cannot escape his constant preoccupation with Gomez. The source reveals that Bieber yearns to be in her presence, to communicate with her, and to be connected to her in any way possible. He has become reliant on her presence, comparing it to a potent drug that he craves endlessly.

As Bieber continues to grapple with their separation, he has devised plans for their reunion in Los Angeles. Upon her return, he eagerly anticipates demonstrating his affection by arranging special outings and romantic gestures to rekindle their relationship. Unfortunately, it remains uncertain when Gomez will return to the West Coast. Nevertheless, her Instagram posts portray a joyous and carefree experience, accompanied by a cryptic message suggesting her focus on self-care and a disregard for impressing others. Could this be an indication of her mindset following their recent split?

After witnessing Gomez photographed alongside an Australian man, Johnny Rays, on a boat on March 19, fans of the couple were sent into a state of panic. Although the photos imply a friendly relationship between Gomez and Rays, some fans interpreted their closeness as cause for concern.

Amid Gomez's vacation, Bieber has been keeping himself occupied by engaging in physical activities. Candid shots depict him participating in hockey and soccer games with his friends. However, the emotional toll of their separation seems to have affected him as evident by his severe fall during a soccer match on March 19 and what appears to be a breakdown on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.

It is worth noting that Jelena, as they are known to their devoted followers, reunited in October 2017 following Gomez's split from The Weeknd. Their bond appeared unbreakable, even celebrating New Year's together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, reports indicate that their relationship faced challenges coinciding with Bieber's birthday on March 1."

gossipcop-28284230,"Not so fast! Madonna was hit with a series of “uncomfortable questions” by a judge before she was granted permission to adopt her 4-year-old twin girls from Malawi, the presiding judge said in court documents obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, February 8.  “The petitioner is a professional performer and I guarded myself against the danger of her merely reciting a well-rehearsed speech by asking her some rather uncomfortable questions to which she gave very candid answers,” Judge Fiona Mwale said in her ruling, explaining her reasons for approving the adoption.  After pressing Madonna, 58, to explain her intentions in adding two more little ones to her brood of four, Judge Mwale said she was satisfied that the girls would be in good hands with the Material Girl.  “There is no doubt that the petitioner can offer the infants not only the best education money can buy, but also guidance with a high likelihood of ensuring that the two infants grow to be self-sufficient adults,” Judge Mwale said, adding that she is satisfied that Madonna “is motivated by her desire to offer a home, love, protection and guidance to the infants.”  In the court documents, Judge Mwale addressed prior controversies surrounding Madonna’s adoptions in Malawi. “In determining her motives, I questioned the petitioner at length about the impact of her decision which could be construed as robbing Malawi of its most precious resource, its children,” the judge wrote.  As previously reported, Madonna filed for adoption in High Court in Malawi on January 25 but tried to keep the process under wraps until a final decision was made. (The Queen of Pop issued a statement denying her adoption to Us Weekly that same day, claiming that she was in Malawi “to check on the children’s hospital in Blantyre.”) According to the AP, she has already raised $7.5 million for a pediatric surgery ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, which is set to open early next year.  Madonna previously adopted son David and daughter Mercy James, both 11, from Malawi in 2008 and 2009, respectively. She is also mom to daughter Lourdes, 20, whom she shares with ex Carlos Leon, and son Rocco, 16, whom she shares with ex-husband Guy Ritchie.  Madonna’s twin girls will retain their birth names as a part of an effort to preserve their identity as Malawian nationals, the court documents said, and their father was at the January 25 court hearing with Madonna. (The twins’ mother died within a week of childbirth due to health complications.)  On Wednesday, February 8, Madonna took to social media to share the happy news. “I can officially confirm I have completed the process of adopting twin sisters from Malawi and am overjoyed that they are now part of our family,” she captioned an image of herself walking between the two little girls. “I am deeply grateful to all those in Malawi who helped make this possible, and I ask the media please to respect our privacy during this transitional time. 🙏🏻 Thank you also to my friends, family and my very large team for all your support and Love!”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

RELATED: Celebrity splits of 2017","Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's custody and divorce proceedings have been extended, potentially prolonging the negotiation process for an entire year. Recent reports state that the celebrity couple requested additional time to reach agreements regarding the custody of their six children and the fair distribution of their assets. Prior to this development, Pitt and Jolie were engaged in private and amicable discussions with a focus on prioritizing their family. However, Angelina changed her approach when she perceived Brad as exerting excessive pressure to resolve the situation in his favor. A court order, cited by a tabloid, states that the deadline for all proceedings before the temporary judge has been extended from December 31, 2017, to December 31, 2018. Consequently, the insider reveals that their custody battle may continue for another year. The estranged couple initially split in September 2016, and their current arrangement grants Angelina primary custody while Brad is permitted visitation rights. Sources suggest that Brad is now requesting joint custody. Despite recent claims circulating in an OK report about the couple considering discontinuing the divorce altogether, Gossip Cop has debunked these rumors.

Renowned brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Michael Kors, and Chanel have all recognized her talent and featured her in their campaigns. Born on August 24, 1998 in Los Angeles, California, Sofia is the youngest daughter of the renowned singer and songwriter Lionel Richie. Additionally, she shares a special bond with her adoptive sister, Nicole Richie, who is a notable fashion designer and television personality. 

During her early years, Sofia Richie had the privilege of being the goddaughter of the late Michael Jackson. Fond memories of her visits to the legendary Neverland Ranch have shaped her childhood, and she developed a close friendship with his daughter, Paris. Moreover, Sofia's passion for music, similar to her father's, became evident at a young age. With vocal training from Beyonce's vocal coach, Tim Carter, and collaborating in the studio with her brother-in-law and Good Charlotte lead vocalist, Joel Madden, Sofia exhibited her musical talent. However, due to the immense pressure associated with living up to her father's musical legacy, she decided to pursue a different path.

Education wise, Sofia Richie attended Oaks Christian School, which earned the moniker ""Celebrity High,"" before being homeschooled while her father was on tour. As an active and sports-oriented individual, she passionately played soccer until an unfortunate Segway accident at the age of 16 led to a hip injury.

Sofia Richie's modeling career initiated at the age of 14 when she graced the pages of Teen Vogue, marking her remarkable debut. A year later, she secured her first fashion contract with Los Angeles-based swimwear company, Mary Grace Swim. Consequently, at the age of 15, Sofia joined the esteemed London-based modeling agency, Select Model Management, which further solidified her presence in the fashion industry.

Her influence within the industry is undeniable, having appeared in various advertising campaigns for renowned brands, including DL1961, Madonna's Material Girl line, Chanel, Dolce & Gabbana, Adidas, Michael Kors, and Tommy Hilfiger. Furthermore, her striking features have captured the attention of esteemed magazines such as Elle and Vanity Fair, and she has recently graced the covers of Complex and Billboard magazine's style issue - all testaments to her outstanding achievements and contributions to the world of fashion."

gossipcop-880467,"Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied  Jamie Lee Curtis says in a new interview that she'd happily reprise her iconic role as Laurie Strode in a sequel to 2018's Halloween revival, if director David Gordon Green returns. There's no question that the newest Halloween, which wipes the slate clean with all other sequels in the long-running franchise, is a rousing success. Strong critical reviews gave way to a massive debut at the box office, one of the highest ever in October.  Green's Halloween certainly benefited from a return to the same basic premise as John Carpenter's classic original, trading in decades of increasingly messy follow-ups for a direct line to the Michael Myers that terrified audiences in the first place. The director went back to basics for this one as he avoided the supernatural and went for a renewed focus on the psychological. Clearly, Curtis was happy with the job that Green did, as are theatergoers. And despite the film's commercial success, that's likely not on the legendary actress' radar as far as whether she'd do another Halloween. But the director is.  Related: Halloween's 5 Timelines Explained (And Which Movies You MUST See)  As she explained simply in a new interview with Empire Magazine Australia (via Bloody Disgusting), Curtis says she'd be in for another Halloween sequel if Green takes the helm once again. It's certainly possible, since the original plan from Blumhouse was to shoot two Halloween sequels back-to-back. Producers ultimately decided that making two films at once was too risky. But now, it sure looks like another film will follow, with or without Green behind the cameras. ""If David Gordon Green called me up and said let’s do another Halloween, I would do another Halloween,"" Curtis said.  Producer Malek Akkad expounded upon Blumhouse's decision to keep it to one sequel in a recent interview. Essentially, he found it too ambitious to shoot two Halloween films without knowing how the first one would be received. Well, the next Halloween is reportedly already in motion, but the latest report suggests that Green and co-writer Danny McBride wouldn't be on board for it. That could change, but if Jason Blum is determined to pull a Paranormal Activity and crank out the next sequel in time for Halloween 2019, he'll need a decision from the director pretty quickly.  It's also possible that money talks. Halloween is already becoming one of Blumhouse's highest-grossing films after just one weekend, and it's doing so on a typically tight Blumhouse budget. At over $90 million domestically already, the film has a good chance to ultimately blow by Paranormal Activity ($107.9 million) and Paranormal Activity 3 ($104 million) and settle in at No. 3 behind the studio's crown jewels, Get Out and Split. Green may not necessarily need the money, but it might be hard for the director to turn away from that kind of financial success, especially when he was originally planning to do at least two films anyway.  Still, based on Curtis' comment in her interview, she may not be interested in another appearance as Laurie Strode unless Green is back. It's hard to blame her; Green had established himself as a formidable cinematic storyteller with Stronger, and showed off his horror chops to thrilling effect with Halloween. He and Curtis certainly make a fine duo, but 2018's Halloween may ultimately be the only time they team up.

gossipcop-877012,"Flavor Flav needs money. So says a lawsuit filed in federal court Wednesday, in which Flav accuses Public Enemy co-founder Chuck D and two business managers of cheating him out of royalties and merchandising revenue.  Flav — real name, William Drayton — contends that his Public Enemy royalties have dwindled to almost nothing in recent years. In the last few months, he and his representatives have attempted to get a full accounting of the money owed to him, but have been thwarted.  Flavor Flav and Chuck D were the two core members of the group. Chuck D was seen as the serious musical talent while Flav played the goofy hype man. The suit hints at years of pent-up hard feelings over this perception of their relative importance. Flav contends that there have been many attempts “to minimize his role in the Public Enemy business” over the years, while managers continued to exploit “his fame and persona to market the brand.”  In addition to naming Chuck D as a defendant, the suit also goes after Gary Rinaldo, the group’s business manager since 2008, and Clifton “Greg” Johnson, who was until recently Flav’s longtime personal manager.  Related Chuck D Joins Universal Hip Hop Museum as Chairman of the Celebrity Board LeBron James and Channing Tatum Pitch 'Public Enemy' Lands at New Line  Flav alleges that he has not seen a dime in streaming or download revenue, and that the defendants have licensed Public Enemy’s image without his permission.  The suit states that Rinaldo “entered into merchandising deals for products as disparate as Public Enemy branded watches, dolls of Drayton and bicycles, all without consent of Drayton, all without advance notice or compensation to Drayton.” Flav also alleges that he was not consulted about a set of Public Enemy action figures, which were sculpted in Japan, and has received no payment from the sale of the toys.  This summer, Public Enemy made a new album, “Nothing is Quick in the Desert,” available as a free download for a period of just six days. Though Flavor Flav was listed as an executive producer on the album, he says he was completely blindsided by it.  The suit says that Flav was contacted this spring about the project, and agreed to come to California to record.  “Drayton was in need of money to support his family, and Defendants were aware of that fact,” the suit states.  Flav requested a $75,000 fee. After a day of recording, he was given just $7,500 and told that more money would be wired to him later. He says he went to his hotel to wait for the remaining amount, and when it did not arrive he went back home to Las Vegas. According to the suit, he did not believe that his recordings would be used because they were of poor quality, and was surprised when the album was released on June 29.  “He had never heard of the album, nor heard any of the final mixes,” the suit states.

The suit states that Rinaldo “entered into merchandising deals for products as disparate as Public Enemy branded watches, dolls of Drayton and bicycles, all without consent of Drayton, all without advance notice or compensation to Drayton.” Flav also alleges that he was not consulted about a set of Public Enemy action figures, which were sculpted in Japan, and has received no payment from the sale of the toys.  This summer, Public Enemy made a new album, “Nothing is Quick in the Desert,” available as a free download for a period of just six days. Though Flavor Flav was listed as an executive producer on the album, he says he was completely blindsided by it.  The suit says that Flav was contacted this spring about the project, and agreed to come to California to record.  “Drayton was in need of money to support his family, and Defendants were aware of that fact,” the suit states.  Flav requested a $75,000 fee. After a day of recording, he was given just $7,500 and told that more money would be wired to him later. He says he went to his hotel to wait for the remaining amount, and when it did not arrive he went back home to Las Vegas. According to the suit, he did not believe that his recordings would be used because they were of poor quality, and was surprised when the album was released on June 29.  “He had never heard of the album, nor heard any of the final mixes,” the suit states.

gossipcop-902055,"Christmas is a time for goodwill, seasonal cheer, and forgiveness, so it seems fitting that the royal family is set to move past some recent rumors to once again celebrate Christmas en masse at the royal estate of Sandringham.  Despite talk of sibling rivalry, tearful duchesses, and diva-like behavior in the court of Kensington Palace, William and Kate Middleton and Harry and Meghan Markle will be together on Christmas Day, the Palace has confirmed. The news comes just after Kensington Palace attempted to snuff out reports of difficulty between the duchesses with a terse comment to The Sun over the weekend.  Although it is William and Kate’s turn to visit the Middletons this year (they usually alternate Christmas between their two families and spent Christmas with the Queen last year), royal sources say that they have decided to join the royal family for Christmas Day.  It is believed they will then head to Bucklebury, Kate’s parents’ hometown, to enjoy a second Christmas with her family.  Kate’s mother, Carole Middleton, revealed in her first-ever interview, published in The Daily Telegraph over the weekend, that she has prepared an extra-special Christmas this year to welcome the two newest family members, her grandsons Prince Louis and Arthur, son of Pippa Middleton.  There will be no fewer than 12 Christmas trees at Bucklebury Manor, the Middleton family’s home, with one just for Prince George to decorate, but the Cambridges will have to skip the Middletons’ traditional smoked salmon and Champagne brunch on Christmas morning because they will be with the Queen and the rest of the royal family at church in Norfolk. It will be the first time the Cambridges and the Sussexes, a.k.a the “Fab Four,” will have been pictured together since reports of a simmering feud rocked the Palace.  It was reported this weekend that courtiers have launched a “mole hunt” to try to uncover who has been leaking stories of tensions between Harry and William and Kate and Meghan. Reports of discord between the couples emerged after Kensington Palace announced last weekend that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would be moving out of Kensington Palace in the new year and into Frogmore House in Windsor.  Since then it has been claimed that Kate and Meghan don’t get along and that the brothers have fallen out because William voiced concerns about how quickly Harry’s relationship with Meghan was moving.  The Queen, who dislikes any rumors of discord regarding her family, will no doubt be relieved that the family will be coming together on Christmas Day. After the family celebrates with a turkey dinner on Christmas Eve, the sight of the foursome at church on Christmas morning will, courtiers hope, put an end to the unhappy narrative that the couples have fallen out.

This was essential to solidify the story that Lucas was trying to tell: Anakin Skywalker's fall from grace and transformation into Darth Vader. During the production of Revenge of the Sith, Christensen asked Lucas if a special Vader suit could be constructed to fit his own body, rather than have a different actor don one of the original sets of Vader armor worn by David Prowse.[17] Lucas agreed, and a suit was engineered to fit Christensen's frame, even including extensions to allow for the actor to attain Vader's 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) height. His voice as the ""robotic"" Vader, however, was dubbed over by James Earl Jones, who first made the voice famous in the original trilogy.[18] Stock footage of Christensen was used in the 2004 DVD-release edition of Return of the Jedi, where he was inserted to replace Sebastian Shaw as the ghost of the redeemed Anakin Skywalker.[19] This was one of the most controversial changes.[20][21] Lucas wanted Anakin's inner person to return to who he was before he turned to the dark side.[22] Christensen insisted this was done without his knowledge, an act that was confirmed by Lucasfilm itself in the featurette ""Return of the Jedi: What has changed?"" as seen on the official website to commemorate the 2006 DVDs.[23] His performance in both Episode II and III received generally mixed reviews by critics[24][25][26][27] (earning him the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor in both films).[28][29][30] Christensen was named in both People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People and Teen People's 25 Hottest Stars under 25.[31] For his performance in Episode III, he won the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain.[32] 2006–present Jumper in Rome in 2006 Christensen with then–girlfriend Rachel Bilson filmingin Rome in 2006 Between 2006 and 2007, he starred in Awake, with Jessica Alba, which tells the story of a man who remains awake but paralyzed during heart surgery,[6][33] and co-starred in Factory Girl, opposite Sienna Miller and Guy Pearce.[6][34] Christensen next co-starred with Samuel L.

You feel insane, but I think the studio cut my days because I started speaking total gibberish. Became a total liability."" However, recent information from a reliable source suggests that Robert has found stability and direction in his life with the support of his fiancé FKA Twigs. According to an insider from OK!, they state that ""Rob was essentially a constant pot smoker during his Twilight days, but since his relationship with Twigs became serious, he has significantly reduced his indulgence in vices and seldom consumes alcohol or engages in smoking in the presence of others.""

Considering the stress Robert endured as a result of his fame from the Twilight series, we can only imagine the impact the highly publicized photos of Kristen Stewart kissing her movie producer, while they were still together, had on him. Expressing this sentiment, the insider adds, ""He's shown immense growth and has become a profoundly serious young man. Rob is disappointed that Charlie [Hunnam] has not given up his marijuana habit. He prefers not to associate with him or his other friends known for their excessive partying, such as Tom Sturridge or Eddie Redmayne.""

Since Robert began dating FKA Twigs in 2014, there have been no reports of any negative aspects concerning her. It seems that having a partner who leads a low-profile and exhibits maturity has been exactly what he needed to make positive changes in his life."

But from day one there was open communication with Ricky about what I had gone through. I think one of the reasons I fell in love so quickly is that I could say everything and know I was not being judged.”  Bischoff hasn’t spoken to Soules recently but says she wishes him well. “I hope that he meets someone, if he hasn’t already, just as great for him and Ricky is for me.”  Now, Bischoff still watches The Bachelor, but says she’s moved on from her own reality show past. “That journey was a big part of my life,” she says. “But since I’ve met Ricky, I really haven’t looked back.”  Busy with wedding plans (the couple are looking at a date next fall), Bischoff says she nonetheless has positive associations with the show. “It’s sad that it ended the way it had to end, but I was still looking for that perfect someone.

While millions of people had witnessed her previous engagement to Chris Soules on national television, this proposal was a surprise that left Bischoff truly shocked and overwhelmed with joy. Reflecting upon the moment, she shares, ""It was just perfect. Ricky got me good! I was so happy that I couldn’t quit smiling. My cheeks hurt!""

Bischoff, a 31-year-old fertility nurse, and Angel, a sales manager, initially connected on the dating app Bumble in September of last year. They quickly formed a deep connection, and by May, the couple decided to move in together. Recalling their first date, Bischoff explains, ""On our first date, we just clicked. It was easy and that’s the way it should be.""

However, Bischoff admits that returning to the dating scene after her painful split from Soules in 2015 was a challenging experience. She was still in the process of healing and trying to rebuild her life. Yet, with Ricky, she found solace in open communication, sharing her past experiences and emotions without judgment. This vulnerability contributed to the rapid development of their love. Bischoff expresses, ""I think one of the reasons I fell in love so quickly is that I could say everything and know I was not being judged.""

Although Bischoff and Soules have not spoken recently, she sincerely wishes him well, hoping that he finds someone who is as great for him as Ricky is for her. While she still follows The Bachelor, Bischoff mentions that she has moved on from her own reality show past. She states, ""That journey was a big part of my life. But since I’ve met Ricky, I really haven’t looked back.""

Currently, Bischoff is busy with her wedding plans, targeting a date in the next fall. Despite her positive associations with the show, she acknowledges that its ending was not ideal. Nonetheless, she didn't let her past experiences close her heart to finding the perfect someone. As she confidently asserts, ""Everything works out for a reason."""

If you watch Keeping Up With The Kardashians or read Kourtney’s blog, you might have noticed just how passionate the reality star is about natural beauty.  Ahead, we take a look at some of Kourtney Kardashian’s beauty secrets for natural skin care, including what natural deodorant she uses and how she keeps her skin hydrated with manuka honey.  Kourtney Kardashian uses natural ingredients in her skin care regimen. | Chris Delmas/AFP/Getty Images Kourtney Kardashian uses natural ingredients in her skin care regimen. | Chris Delmas/AFP/Getty Images  Coconut oil  Superfood ingredients such as coconut oil have made their mark on natural skin care and beauty products. And, like many natural beauty devotees, Kourtney is no stranger to its beauty benefits. On top of using the natural oil in her hair, the reality star likes to moisturize her body with it, too. According to her app, Kourtney applies coconut oil to her body skin “right out of the shower” and let it sit for 10 minutes.  In addition, the reality star uses coconut oil in some homemade beauty recipes, too. One of Kourtney’s go-to’s? A DIY lip scrub made with coconut oil, manuka honey, and sugar. The natural concoction gently sloughs off dry skin and nourishes for a silky soft, smooth, lipstick-ready pout.  Manuka honey  Another all-natural ingredient Kourtney Kardashian swears by for skin care? Manuka honey. The reality star is a big fan of Manuka Doctor skin care products and also swears by the all-natural superfood honey for home skin treatments.  Thanks to its natural humectants and anti-aging properties, manuka honey can be used in beauty for many things. For soft, hydrated skin, more youthful-looking skin, apply manuka honey to the complexion as a face mask and let it sit for about 10 minutes before rinsing. You can also add it to homemade beauty product or as a spot treatment on pimples. In addition to being anti-aging and hydrating, manuka honey also boasts anti-bacterial properties that can help combat breakouts and keep the complexion clear.  good morning A post shared by Kourtney Kardashian (@kourtneykardash) on Oct 7, 2017 at 10:57am PDT  Natural deodorant  Like other celebrities and wellness aficionados, Kourtney no longer uses chemical-ridden deodorants and switched to a natural deodorant. “Changing over to an all-natural deodorant seemed like an important thing to do when I heard that when people are diagnosed with breast cancer, they are told to immediately discontinue using conventional antiperspirants and deodorants,” the reality star shared in a blog post. “Although research connecting the parabens and aluminum from these products directly with breast cancer is inconclusive, I like to play it safe,” she concluded.  So, what natural deodorant does Kourtney swear by? Schmidt’s Natural Ylang Ylang + Calendula deodorant. At $8.99 a pop, the natural deodorant is more affordable than other other natural brands. In addition, it features an award-winning formula made with essential oils and free of aluminum, parabens, propylene glycol, and phthalates.

If you watch Keeping Up With The Kardashians or read Kourtney’s blog, you might have noticed just how passionate the reality star is about natural beauty.  Ahead, we take a look at some of Kourtney Kardashian’s beauty secrets for natural skin care, including what natural deodorant she uses and how she keeps her skin hydrated with manuka honey.

And, like many natural beauty devotees, Kourtney is no stranger to its beauty benefits. On top of using the natural oil in her hair, the reality star likes to moisturize her body with it, too. According to her app, Kourtney applies coconut oil to her body skin “right out of the shower” and let it sit for 10 minutes.  In addition, the reality star uses coconut oil in some homemade beauty recipes, too. One of Kourtney’s go-to’s? A DIY lip scrub made with coconut oil, manuka honey, and sugar. The natural concoction gently sloughs off dry skin and nourishes for a silky soft, smooth, lipstick-ready pout.  Manuka honey  Another all-natural ingredient Kourtney Kardashian swears by for skin care? Manuka honey. The reality star is a big fan of Manuka Doctor skin care products and also swears by the all-natural superfood honey for home skin treatments.  Thanks to its natural humectants and anti-aging properties, manuka honey can be used in beauty for many things. For soft, hydrated skin, more youthful-looking skin, apply manuka honey to the complexion as a face mask and let it sit for about 10 minutes before rinsing. You can also add it to homemade beauty product or as a spot treatment on pimples. In addition to being anti-aging and hydrating, manuka honey also boasts anti-bacterial properties that can help combat breakouts and keep the complexion clear.  good morning A post shared by Kourtney Kardashian (@kourtneykardash) on Oct 7, 2017 at 10:57am PDT  Natural deodorant  Like other celebrities and wellness aficionados, Kourtney no longer uses chemical-ridden deodorants and switched to a natural deodorant. “Changing over to an all-natural deodorant seemed like an important thing to do when I heard that when people are diagnosed with breast cancer, they are told to immediately discontinue using conventional antiperspirants and deodorants,” the reality star shared in a blog post. “Although research connecting the parabens and aluminum from these products directly with breast cancer is inconclusive, I like to play it safe,” she concluded.  So, what natural deodorant does Kourtney swear by? Schmidt’s Natural Ylang Ylang + Calendula deodorant. At $8.99 a pop, the natural deodorant is more affordable than other other natural brands. In addition, it features an award-winning formula made with essential oils and free of aluminum, parabens, propylene glycol, and phthalates.

Trivial observations, such as a photo of Aniston placing her hand on her stomach, have been enough for certain tabloids to speculate about her becoming a mother. In the latest issue of Star magazine, the headline reads, ""Jen To Justin: I'll Raise Our Baby Alone!"" The article claims that Aniston, desiring motherhood, has hired a surrogate and is prepared to embark on this journey with or without her husband. Allegedly, Aniston confided in an anonymous source, disclosing her troubled marriage and her commitment to raise the child as a single parent.

However, this account quickly loses credibility when contradictory statements are mentioned. The insider claims that Aniston is actively searching for the right surrogate, which contradicts their previous assertion. This discrepancy raises doubts regarding the authenticity of the claim.

Many individuals view this tabloid story as entirely false, as the contradictory statements within the article suggest a lack of truthfulness. Additionally, the insider's decision to share such private and secretive information with a tabloid raises questions about their motives and credibility. This particular publication has a history of publishing misleading stories; earlier this year, they claimed Aniston was pregnant, only to disregard this in their recent article.

Aniston has openly expressed her views on these pregnancy tabloids in an interview with Glamour magazine in August. She explained that these stories engage in body shaming and violate the privacy she shares with her husband. Aniston firmly asserted that whether or not she has a baby is no one's business but her own. She emphasized that the decision to have a child is a personal matter, and individuals should refrain from passing judgment on others.

Ultimately, Jennifer Aniston reminds us that each person's choices regarding parenthood are unique and should be respected. Behind closed doors, nobody truly knows the complexities and intricacies of another person's life."

Though her 1989 world tour boasted numerous sold out performances (it eventually became the highest grossing tour of 2015), it appears her considerably more expensive snake persona is a tougher sell.  Last month, her “longtime” tour promoter told Billboard, “By the time all the tickets are sold next week, I’ll be celebrating Taylor’s birthday with a cocktail in my hand and sold-out concerts all over the world.” But her birthday has come and gone, and not one date has sold out.  Reputation was the biggest-selling album of 2017 and the tour is shaping up to be far from ill-attended, so the Post’s headline, “Taylor Swift’s Reputation tour shaping up to be a disaster,” is a little much. It does, however, highlight the problems with unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and Ticketmaster in general.  The company’s “Verified Fan” program, which they would like you to believe is all about rewarding music lovers, appears to be nothing but a cash grab that takes advantage of Swift-obsessed teens with easy access to their parents’ credit card numbers.

This comes as a surprise, considering her previous 1989 world tour was immensely successful, becoming the highest grossing tour of 2015. However, it seems that her current persona as a more expensive and edgy artist is proving to be a tougher sell.

Just last month, a tour promoter, who has worked with Swift for a long time, confidently stated to Billboard that all tickets would be sold out by Taylor's birthday, with concerts around the world sold out as well. However, Taylor's birthday has passed and not a single date on her tour has sold out.

Despite this, it is important to note that Reputation was the top-selling album of 2017, indicating that the tour is expected to have a decent turnout. Therefore, while the Post's headline claiming that the tour is shaping up to be a disaster may be an exaggeration, it does bring attention to certain issues such as unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and the role of Ticketmaster in general.

Ticketmaster's ""Verified Fan"" program, which is supposed to reward music lovers, appears to be more focused on profit rather than providing a fair opportunity to fans. The program allegedly takes advantage of teens who are obsessed with Swift and have easy access to their parents' credit card numbers. By spending money on merchandise, fans can supposedly improve their chances of getting better positions in the ticket queue. However, once the tickets are accessible, they often turn out to be too expensive for many fans to afford.

A fan mentioned in the Post article shared that they had paid $150 for their ticket with excellent seats during the 1989 tour. Now, for similar seating, they are expected to pay around $500. This significant increase in ticket prices is certainly a cause for concern.

On a related note, it is worth mentioning that tickets for Katy Perry's upcoming show in New Orleans are currently available starting at $23."

gossipcop-888650,"AMC's zombie drama returned last Sunday with the season 9 premiere---an episode which marked an uptick in overall quality for The Walking Dead, but still made some old, avoidable foibles that almost look like bad habits at this point. New showrunner Angela Kang has been a writer on the show since Season 2, and it appears that even with improved dialogue and cinematography, she's been unable to shed some of the show's most annoying proclivities. Old habits die hard, it seems. But, like Gregory and a few other characters, they really do need to die. Let's take a look at three big mistakes the show made in its Season 9 premiere, and how each could have been easily avoided with a little more quality control and a little bit more courage. With some very small changes, this could have been a much better episode. Spoilers through Season 9 of 'The Walking Dead' follow. 1. The museum scene. Things got off to something of a bad start when our heroes went to D.C. I'm going to list this as a two-part problem. My first problem with this sequence is a creative disagreement with the show's producers and writers. My second is pretty much just the objective truth. First: An excursion to Washington D.C. to find seeds and other tools should have been a much more interesting, extended story. I think you could easily fit in an episode or two with a small group of scavengers going to D.C. and getting into various pickles there. That it was just one not very good scene at a museum really diminished something I was looking forward to, stripping of it of almost all its potential as an interesting little adventure (which the show has so few of these days.) Second: The museum scene was just bad. There was very little explanation as to why they needed all these heavy objects---surely there were more modern versions of things like carts and ploughs which they could find on farms or in hardware stores. Worse, the entire sequence with the glass floor was embarrassingly bad. The floor itself would not have cracked so easily. That kind of glass is made to withstand a great deal more impact. But even if they'd had it broken to begin with, making it more precarious from the get-go, there was no reason they couldn't have found another way around it. Passing items over the railing would have worked. Ezekiel could have avoided walking the entire length of the breaking glass by simply turning to one side or the other once exiting the stairs. This is a classic example of The Walking Dead's writers treating its viewers with contempt. We aren't that stupid. And neither are these characters. These hardened survivors of the apocalypse should know better---and would know better if they weren't continually written into these same corners over and over and over again. This entire sequence was insulting to our intelligence and had no business being in a premiere cable TV show. 2. The death scene. The second big problem of the night came shortly after the first. Our group, comprised largely of characters we know and then also one other guy named Ken, is bringing the museum loot back to Alexandria and Hilltop when a small mob of zombies shuffles up behind them. This leads to much fear and commotion, despite this being a much smaller zombie mob than we've seen the same survivors deal with easily in the past. One thing leads to another and they decide to all run away and, bafflingly, abandon the horses. In an apocalypse where cars are no longer an option, horses must be one of the most prized---and hard to come by---resources out there. But a few zombies can scare Rick and his band of hardened survivors away regardless. Utterly unconvincing. So when Ken (I think that was his name) runs back to save the horses we know right away he's going to die. For reasons the show cannot provide, a zombie manages to sneak up on him and nobody can get to him in time to save him. Maybe that looked okay on paper, but it didn't work on TV and left us with that bad, unconvincing taste in our mout",0,en,0,"AMC's zombie drama returned last Sunday with the season 9 premiere---an episode which marked an uptick in overall quality for The Walking Dead, but still made some old, avoidable foibles that almost look like bad habits at this point.

The Fix: Now, you can fix #1 and #2 in one fell swoop pretty easily (but it won't fix #3.) Simply have the glass in the museum already breaking when they get there. Have them do everything in their power to avoid standing on it (like actual people with a self-preservation motive would do) but have something go wrong. Maybe there's one last item (like the cart) that they can't get around the glass and they lose control and instead of Ezekiel falling through the glass, Ken falls through the glass and is torn apart by zombies in the most gruesome manner possible. Now we can avoid the bad parts of the museum scene and cut the other scene entirely and we get a more shocking, gory death. Everybody wins! There's just one problem . . . . 3. Using a character we don't know as a catalyst for an important event. Don't do that. Every single significant death in a show needs to have a reason or serve some higher purpose, even if it just to shock audiences. Ken's death in the Season 9 premiere served a purpose, but it didn't connect with us emotionally. It was a catalyst for Gregory's final, fatal betrayal of Maggie. It led him to make a very stupid power play, the straw that broke the Maggie's back, as it were, when he got the blacksmith drunk and convinced him to kill Maggie. The problem? There's no payoff. No emotional weight. Because Ken was not an established character at all. He was introduced just to die. His parents were introduced just so that the father could become Gregory's tool in his latest horrible scheme. This is something we saw happen from time to time"

gossipcop-6225895099,"Chris Soules, former star of ABC’s “The Bachelor,” after his arrest. (Buchanan County Sheriff via AP) Iowa farmer Chris Soules, a former star on ABC’s “The Bachelor” who charmed reality TV viewers with his small-town life, was arrested this week after police said he fled a crash that killed a fellow farmer. Soules, 35, was charged with leaving the scene of a fatal crash, a class D felony, and could face up to five years in prison if he is convicted. The case has garnered the attention of Soules’s “Bachelor” fans as well as residents of Arlington, Iowa, where he lives, who had come to appreciate the reality TV star’s work as an unofficial Iowa ambassador and farm industry advocate. “This story is going to spread like wildfire around here and probably all over because of who he is,” Mary Jo Brown, Arlington’s city clerk, told the Des Moines Register. “Sometimes fame isn’t your friend.” Soules, who also appeared in “Dancing with the Stars” and “Worst Chefs in America,” called 911 at 8:20 p.m. Monday evening to report that he had rear-ended a tractor on a rural road north of the tiny town of Aurora, about six miles away from his home. The tractor veered into a ditch after being struck by his 2008 Chevrolet Silverado, Soules said. The tractor driver — later identified as 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, a Vietnam War veteran — was unconscious and not breathing, Soules told the 911 operator, according to audio obtained by local media. The man had a pulse, but there was blood around his mouth, Soules said. Soules identified himself on the call, which lasted nearly six minutes, and sounded frantic. Between heavy breathing, he answered the dispatcher’s questions and took instructions. Soules told the 911 operator he did not know how to perform CPR and could be heard asking unidentified people at the scene if they could perform the lifesaving measure. The call ended abruptly after the operator told Soules law enforcement and medical first responders were on the way. “Can I, can I call you back really quick?” Soules asked the dispatcher. “Yeah, you can call me back,” she says. “Thank you,” Soules responds. Soules left the crash site after emergency responders arrived, but before deputies with the Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office were on the scene, according to authorities. Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Scott Bright told the Des Moines Register that Soules fled the scene on foot and later got into a truck. In police audio obtained by local media, a deputy told a dispatcher that Soules “took off” in a red truck. Authorities are trying to identify who picked up Soules in the truck, Buchanan County Sheriff Bill Wolfgram told the Associated Press. That person could face charges, he said. Alcohol was found at the scene and investigators are trying to determine whose it was and whether it or speed were factors in the crash. Soules was arrested about five hours after the incident and booked into the Buchanan County Jail, the Associated Press reported. He posted a $10,000 bond Tuesday morning and was released on the condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic monitor. During his first appearance in court, the Buchanan County assistant attorney told the judge that Soules refused to cooperate with law enforcement after they located him at his home.

According to court documents, Soules had several run-ins with the law in his early 20s. In 2011, he was charged three times with underage alcohol possession and pleaded guilty and paid a fine for an open container violation, reported the Des Moines Register. The following year, he received three citations for fighting and noise, unlawful use of a license and leaving the scene, which was amended down to defective brakes, court documents showed. Then in 2005, Soules was charged with driving while intoxicated and received one year of probation. A statement from Soules’s publicist earlier this week said he was “devastated” to learn that Mosher had died from the crash and that his “thoughts and prayers” were with the man’s family. Mosher, a lifelong resident of Aurora — population 200 — lived on his family farm near the crash site, reported the Argus Leader. He was married to his high school sweetheart, Nancy, and the couple had two sons and three grandchildren, according to Mosher’s obituary. An Army veteran, Mosher served six years, including a tour in Vietnam. He farmed his entire life and was a member of the Aurora American Legion and the Iowa Corn Growers Association. “Kenny loved playing golf, farming and spending his winters in Florida biking and visiting his mother,” Mosher’s obituary said. “His family was most important to him, especially his grandchildren.” In northeast Iowa, where Mosher and Soules both farmed, community members told local media they were heartbroken for the families of both men.

He proposed to Whitney Bischoff, a contestant from Chicago, but the two split after a brief engagement. He later competed on “Dancing with the Stars” and the Food Network’s “Worst Chefs in America.” Soules has since made guest appearances on various “Bachelor” franchise spin-offs shows and was rumored to be a cast member for this summer’s taping of “Bachelor in Paradise,” where former contestants search for love on","Chris Soules, the former star of ABC’s “The Bachelor,” was arrested this week following a fatal crash in Iowa. Soules, known for his role on reality TV, has been charged with leaving the scene of a fatal crash and could potentially face up to five years in prison. This incident has not only captured the attention of Soules’ fans, but also the residents of Arlington, Iowa, where he resides. Soules had previously been admired in the small town for his advocacy of the farming industry and his unofficial role as an Iowa ambassador. The incident occurred when Soules rear-ended a tractor on a rural road. The driver of the tractor, identified as Kenneth Mosher, was seriously injured and subsequently died. Soules immediately called 911 to report the incident and informed the operator of the situation. He expressed his concern for the injured driver and sought assistance from others at the scene. Soules admitted to not knowing how to perform CPR, leading him to request help from others present. The call ended when emergency responders arrived at the scene. However, Soules left the crash site prior to the arrival of law enforcement officials. Authorities reported that Soules initially fled the scene on foot before getting into a truck. The individual who picked up Soules may potentially face charges. The presence of alcohol at the scene is being investigated, along with the possibility of speed being a factor in the crash. Soules was arrested approximately five hours after the incident and has since been released on bail. He has been ordered to surrender his passport and wear an electronic monitor. Soules has been accused of refusing to cooperate with law enforcement upon their arrival at his residence. The investigation is currently facing some challenges, but Soules is exercising his constitutional rights in the process. Background checks have revealed that Soules has had previous encounters with the law, including charges of underage alcohol possession, fighting, noise, and a previous DUI charge. In response to the incident, Soules issued a statement expressing his devastation at the loss of Mr. Mosher's life and offering his condolences to the family. Mr. Mosher, a Vietnam War veteran and lifelong resident of Aurora, was a respected member of his community, known for his love of golf and farming. The community of northeast Iowa has expressed their sympathy for the families involved in this tragic event. Soules gained fame through his appearances on reality TV, first on ""The Bachelorette"" and later as the star of his own season of ""The Bachelor."" He had also made appearances on other shows such as ""Dancing with the Stars"" and ""Worst Chefs in America."" Soules was expected to appear on the upcoming season of ""Bachelor in Paradise."""

Despite their attempts at mending their marriage through couples therapy after halting a potential divorce, it seems that their efforts have not yielded the desired results. Although the official reason given is Kanye's snoring, insiders reveal that there are deeper underlying issues at play.

According to an insider close to the couple, the once vibrant spark that defined their relationship has vanished, and Kim, burdened by the demands of parenting two young children and another on the way, confesses that she no longer possesses the time or energy to revive the passion in their bedroom. Meanwhile, Kanye, hoping for a miracle, resigns himself to a sexless marriage with a heavy heart.

Throughout their public union, Kim Kardashian, now 36 years old, stood by her husband's side when he faced a highly publicized meltdown last year. Despite her unwavering support, their marriage has never fully recovered from the aftermath. Adding to their challenges, Kim continues to grapple with the emotional aftermath of her notorious Paris robbery while juggling her roles as a mother, reality star, and managing her vast business empire. On the other hand, Kanye's music career has hit a standstill after his departure from the Tidal music streaming service, entangled in a complex legal dispute with Jay-Z.

The strains on their relationship are undeniable, and significant decisions like sleeping apart symbolize the obstacles they currently face. As the couple navigates this delicate period, their fans and the public at large await news of any positive developments.

ET’s Katie Krause spoke with Brolin at the Hallmark Channel and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries winter Television Critics Association red carpet on Saturday, where he revealed that despite his decades-long romance, he still doesn't have all the answers.  “I don’t know, because nobody trains you,” he said of the secret to his and Streisand's marriage. “This is my third time -- third marriage. I picked difficult situations the first two times, but I think you learn with each one. I’m a person that believes that if I’m wrong, that’s when I learn, and when I’m right, I haven’t learned a thing.”  Noting that he takes his relationship “day to day,” Brolin revealed that he’s an advocate of marriage counseling.  “I do believe in counseling if anybody ever has a problem in their marriage. Bring in a referee, talk it over, and I swear to you, it will dispel by the end of the session, each time!” he said. “Sometimes in a tough marriage, it’s tough to talk, but if you do, it works!”  The 77-year-old actor has also learned to maintain his marriage with Streisand by not interrupting her during hectic times.  “When she’s busy, she’s really focused, and part of our good relationship is that I understand that,” he shared. “And if I come to her with something important and she says, ‘I don’t have time right now,’ she doesn’t have time, period. That’s the way the mind works. You gotta focus.”  As for how Streisand, 75, makes him feel special, Brolin said, “I’m always welcome when I get home. I always get notes, ‘Hurry home!’ When I get there, there’s always something kind of great waiting for me, some plan, and I try to reciprocate.”  RELATED CONTENT:  Barbra Streisand Calls Out Golden Globes for Not Awarding More Female Directors  ‘Girls Trip' Star Tiffany Haddish Says She Taught Barbra Streisand All About Cardi B  Josh Brolin on His Ripped Bod and How He Knew Wife Kathyrn Boyd Was the One (Exclusive)  Related Gallery",1,en,"Two decades strong!

In a recent interview with ET's Katie Krause, Brolin shared insights into their successful marriage, acknowledging that despite their long romance, he doesn't have all the answers. With his previous experiences in mind, he emphasized the importance of learning from past mistakes and growing with each relationship.

Brolin emphasized that he firmly believes in the power of marriage counseling, suggesting that it can provide a valuable perspective and help resolve conflicts. By bringing in a third party to facilitate open communication, he believes that many marital issues can be successfully addressed and ultimately resolved.

One key aspect of maintaining their marital harmony is Brolin's understanding and respect for Streisand's busy schedule. He recognizes that during periods of intense focus and productivity, interruptions can be detrimental. Therefore, he makes a conscious effort to respect her space and time. Likewise, when he seeks her attention, he understands that her unavailability is non-negotiable and does not take it personally.

When asked about the ways in which Streisand makes him feel special, Brolin mentioned the warmth and love he receives upon returning home. Whether through thoughtful notes or exciting plans, Streisand ensures that he feels valued and cherished. In return, Brolin endeavors to reciprocate these gestures, striving to create an atmosphere of mutual care and appreciation. 

The enduring love story of James Brolin and Barbra Streisand serves as an inspiration to all, showcasing the beauty and potential of a committed and supportive union. Despite the uncertainties that come with any relationship, their dedication to each other and their willingness to grow and adapt contribute to the continued success of their partnership."

This preoccupation with her routine has become tiresome for those close to her, including Vito Schnabel, often leading him to seek frequent breaks from their relationship. It appears that Heidi's youthful appearance requires more effort than previously assumed. However, her insistence on flaunting her perceived perfection has become a point of contention for her loved ones. An additional annoyance stems from Heidi's attempts to portray herself as ordinary, even going so far as to simulate indulging in junk food while in front of the camera. In reality, she has not consumed a burger in years. Given that she recently spent time in Italy with her boyfriend, it remains unknown how she managed to avoid pasta and pizza during their trip. The insider remarks that conversations with Heidi predominantly revolve around her workout routine and her daily food intake, which typically consists of no more than a few nuts and steamed kale. Such discussions hardly sound enjoyable."

gossipcop-858931,"The Leftovers has closed the book on its final chapter. The HBO drama from Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta aired its finale Sunday night, and it did so by offering more closure than most viewers had been trained to anticipate — not only for all the major characters but even for the show's biggest mystery. (Note: spoilers abound below, so proceed with caution if you haven’t yet watched ""The Book of Nora."") Lindelof had long tempered expectations about the finale, telling The Hollywood Reporter last year when he was writing the final script that The Leftovers is in no way a mystery-solving show. ""If the takeaway from Lost was that there was a disgruntled portion of the fan base that said, 'You did not give satisfactory answers to the mysteries,' then I feel somewhat liberated with The Leftovers because that’s off the table,"" he said at the time. But in an emotional monologue that concludes the third and final season of the thought-provoking drama, Carrie Coon's character Nora Durst actually provides one possible answer to what happened to the 2 percent of the population that suddenly departed years ago. Whether or not she's telling the truth is up for debate. Seated across from an aged Kevin (Justin Theroux), Nora explains that years earlier she got into a machine that transported her to a parallel earth where the departed now live. It was the closure she'd always longed for — except that when she found her three children and husband, it was apparent that they were happy and had moved on with their lives. Realizing there was no place for her in their world, she had the creator of the machine send her back home. ""I knew that if I told you what happened that you would never believe me,"" Nora tells Kevin as she finishes her poignant tale. ""I believe you,"" Kevin assures her, tears streaming down his face. ""You do?"" she asks incredulously. ""Why wouldn't I believe you? You're here,"" he responds before reaching out to grab his former wife's hand. ""I'm here,"" Nora echoes, her mouth slowing turning upward into a smile. And with that, The Leftovers concluded its story, leaving the credibility of Nora's account open to interpretation. ""I definitely feel like there are going to be people out there who watch the show who don’t believe her story,"" says Lindelof, ""and then for a lot of people, it won’t even occur to them to disbelieve it."" Ahead of the finale's debut, THR chatted with Lindelof about why not revealing the fates of certain characters would be a ""travesty,"" the questions he doesn't want to have to answer about the finale and whether or not he personally believes Nora (hint: he really wants to). Now that people have gotten a chance to watch the finale, what's the most surprising question you're getting about it? I can’t explain why it is surprising to me — I mean, I could explain it but I’m not going to — is why didn't we show the story that Nora is telling as she’s telling it? Was that ever a consideration in the writers room? It was something that was discussed very early on when we first were talking about the ending of the series, but once the storytelling process began and scripts started getting written, we landed on the idea of this season, if not the series, being about people telling stories. And, more important, people telling stories that would either give themselves a degree of comfort or that they believed would give comfort to others. That tradition goes all the way back to season one with Matt at the pulpit, and in season two, with Tom [Chris Zylka] speaking in front of the ex-guilty members like AA meetings, saying that he can give magic hugs. So, there’s always been a tradition on the show of characters delivering monologues that are fantastical or believable or unbelievable stories, with themselves at the center of those stories. They’re told in the first person, and it was sort of like, “Oh, yeah, how could we not end the series with Carrie Coon doing that?""

""I'm here,"" Nora echoes, her mouth slowing turning upward into a smile. And with that, The Leftovers concluded its story, leaving the credibility of Nora's account open to interpretation. ""I definitely feel like there are going to be people out there who watch the show who don’t believe her story,"" says Lindelof, ""and then for a lot of people, it won’t even occur to them to disbelieve it."" Ahead of the finale's debut, THR chatted with Lindelof about why not revealing the fates of certain characters would be a ""travesty,"" the questions he doesn't want to have to answer about the finale and whether or not he personally believes Nora (hint: he really wants to). Now that people have gotten a chance to watch the finale, what's the most surprising question you're getting about it? I can’t explain why it is surprising to me — I mean, I could explain it but I’m not going to — is why didn't we show the story that Nora is telling as she’s telling it? Was that ever a consideration in the writers room? It was something that was discussed very early on when we first were talking about the ending of the series, but once the storytelling process began and scripts started getting written, we landed on the idea of this season, if not the series, being about people telling stories. And, more important, people telling stories that would either give themselves a degree of comfort or that they believed would give comfort to others. That tradition goes all the way back to season one with Matt at the pulpit, and in season two, with Tom [Chris Zylka] speaking in front of the ex-guilty members like AA meetings, saying that he can give magic hugs. So, there’s always been a tradition on the show of characters delivering monologues that are fantastical or believable or unbelievable stories, with themselves at the center of those stories. They’re told in the first person, and it was sort of like, “Oh, yeah, how could we not end the series with Carrie Coon doing that?"" When did you know that this is how you wanted to end the show? Very early on. The holdover writers from season two got together in January, and all we talked about was, “What’s the last scene of the finale, and when and where does the finale take place? And what are the things we want to resolve definitively, and what are the things that we’re OK not resolving definitively, etc.” They were both esoteric, enthymematic conversations and then they became much more directed toward the scene we ended up with and we explored different permutations. It was always going to be that Nora tells the story of going through, but there were a couple different permutations of who she was telling that story to — and then it became very obvious to us that it had to be Kevin. That was locked in before we even started breaking the season premiere. Who were the others that you considered for her telling the story to? Erika Murphy was a contender, and then a grown-up version of Lily who would be maybe a 19- or 20-year-old young woman at the time that this would be taking place. Those were really the only other two contenders, other than Kevin. And how did you land on it being Kevin? Well, it isn’t to say that Kevin isn’t an incredibly important character in The Leftovers — of course he is — but I think the idea is that the third and final season was just as much about Nora’s journey as it was about Kevin’s. His journey would resolve in the penultimate episode and then her journey would resolve in the finale. And that’s inevitable for us because she just lost so much more. He’s been suffering in this kind of existential way. He feels like he’s a coward and he feels like he"

gossipcop-904068,"Multiple women have accused Oscar-winning movie director Paul Haggis of sexual assault. Last month, publicist Haleigh Breest filed a civil suit alleging that the filmmaker, who picked up Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay Academy Awards for 2004’s Crash, of rape. On Friday, three other women came forward to The Associated Press with accusations of sexual misconduct.  Haggis denied the claims in Breest’s suit, which was filed in mid-December, and filed a countersuit, claiming the publicist and her lawyer had attempted to extort $9 million from him in exchange for withholding her suit. Breest claimed that Haggis assaulted her in 2013 after he offered her a ride home after an event, but instead took her to his Manhattan apartment; there, she said, he forced her to perform oral sex on him, fondled her, asked if she enjoyed anal sex and raped her. Haggis’ lawyer, Christine Lepera – who represented producer Dr. Luke in the wake of pop-star Kesha accusing him of sexual assault – said, “He didn’t rape anybody,” in a statement.  “Mr. Haggis denies these anonymous claims in whole. In a society where one of a person’s fundamental rights is the ability to confront an accuser, that right has now been eviscerated when it comes to anyone being charged in the press with any sort of sexual misconduct,” a rep for Haggis said in a statement to Rolling Stone. “Notably, no one has reached out to anyone on Mr. Haggis’ team other than the press to report this. He views the fact that these reports appear to be spearheaded from the law firm representing Ms. Breest, as a further tactic to try to harm him and continue their effort to obtain money … We reiterate our claim against Ms. Breest, and note again that we initiated the legal proceedings, not Ms. Breest.”  The new accusers said they felt empowered to come forward after learning of Breest’s story and seeing women report stories of powerful men engaging in sexual misconduct as part of the #MeToo movement. The women, who all chose to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution, claimed to have stories similar to Breest’s: they were all in their 20s or early 30s and they all said Haggis allegedly attempted to set up private meetings with them to discuss business but subsequently tried to kiss them. Two said that Haggis allegedly became more antagonistic when they resisted him.  A lawyer for Breest did not immediately reply to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment but told The AP that Haggis’ countersuit was “a preposterous and transparent PR stunt that will not succeed” and “a further act of aggression.”  One of the new accusers said she was 28 when the alleged attack took place in 1996. She claims she was working on a television show that Haggis produced when he asked her to review some photos from the show. When they met in a back office, she claimed he tried to kiss her. “He said, ‘Do you really want to continue working?'” she claimed. He then allegedly forced her to perform oral sex on him and pushed her onto the floor and raped her.  Another new accuser said she was in her 30s in the late 2000s when she set up a meeting with Haggis to pitch him on a TV show. She said that Haggis told her that he and his wife had an understanding about extramarital sex and came around a table attempting to kiss her. She ran to her car as Haggis allegedly pursued her, though she was able to drive away.  The last new accuser said she was in her late 20s in 2015 when Haggis allegedly held down her arms, kissed her and followed her into a taxi in Canada. When the cab took her to her apartment, she said Haggis allegedly tossed money at the driver, pursued her and kissed her again before she could get inside and close the door. She said that he then waved at her from outside her residence and claimed that he sent aggressive text messages over the next 24 hours until she blocked him.

While it is true that they often spend time apart, this is due to various reasons and not because they have broken up or are taking a break. In fact, they were seen leaving church together in Los Angeles just recently, although in separate vehicles. It is important to note that despite their continued commitment, their relationship, like any other, is not without its challenges. They have overcome several obstacles since they started dating in 2010 and have had an on-again, off-again relationship until 2015. However, they reconnected last year and have chosen to keep their relationship private, allowing Selena to prioritize her health issues and personal needs. As a sufferer of lupus and a recent kidney transplant recipient, the 25-year-old singer has been working hard to take care of herself and make decisions that are in her best interest. Contrary to any speculation, Justin has been supportive and understanding of Selena's circumstances. It is worth mentioning that Selena's family, particularly her mother, Mandy Teefey, has had reservations about their reunion due to past ups and downs. This ongoing conflict continues to affect Selena's relationship with Justin. However, if they are able to resolve these issues or if her family's perspective changes, it could greatly improve the dynamics of their relationship. Despite these challenges, Selena publicly acknowledged their rekindled romance for the first time on Justin's 24th birthday, hinting at their deep connection and shared humor.

While vacationing in Italy, Jillian Michaels claims a yacht crew member tried to extort her through an “aggressive and threatening” exchange.  The fitness star opened up on Facebook saying she had chartered a boat for 12 days for $60k, but when she arrived on Tuesday, the boat was rusted and damaged.  The 43-year-old trainer said the crew demanded extra money for fuel because the “gas cash had been drained by mobsters in Capri,” writes the Daily Mail.  In a video sent to the Daily Mail, Michaels is seen arguing with a crew member and is insisting the interaction be filmed. She claims she is being scammed and held hostage.

gossipcop-878828,"In an interview with Channel 4, a British public service television network, American actress Jennifer Lawrence blamed the recent hurricanes on Donald Trump’s voters, because they don’t believe in man-made climate change. During the lengthy interview on her new movie Mother!, the conversation turned political about halfway through. After discussing the alleged pay gap between men and women, the interviewer asked Lawrence about climate change and the political climate in America.  “I mean when the director was asked about the film, why it was so dark, he said, ‘It’s a mad time to be alive.’ And there is certainly an end of days feeling about it. For many people, in America who would say, [grimaces] perhaps it’s truer there at the moment than anywhere else,” the Channel 4 reporter prompted Lawrence to comment.  “It’s scary,” she responded. “You know, it’s this new language that’s forming, I don’t even recognize it. It’s also scary to know, that climate change is due to human activity, and we continue to ignore it, and the only voice that we really have is through voting,” Lawrence stated.  “And you have voted very recently, as a country” the interviewer acknowledged.  “And we voted, and it was really startling,” Lawrence added. She then insinuated that the hurricanes were “Mother Nature’s rage and wrath” at America for Trump.  “You know you’re watching these hurricanes now, and it’s really hard especially while promoting this movie, not to feel mother nature’s rage and wrath,” she stated.  “It’s not just about climate change though is it, in America? It seems to be a time of huge division,” the reporter added.  “Yeah, it’s really polarizing and upsetting. You know I’ve heard things and seen things on T.V. in my own country that devastate me and make me sick, and it’s just really confusing,” Lawrence stated.  “Do you find President Trump confusing?” the reporter pressed further.  “I don’t find him confusing. I think I know exactly what he is,” Lawrence said solemnly before smirking.  Wrapping up the interview, the reporter asked Lawrence how she felt about the future. The Hollywood actress didn’t have much hope with Trump leading the country, calling her recent film a “howl of rage” in response to what’s going on in America:  SUPPORT PRO-LIFE NEWS! Please help LifeNews.com with a donation  “I have to feel hope, you know you have to feel hope. You can’t just fall into despair. But a producer on the movie called this film, ‘an impotent howl of rage.’ It’s like a helpless howl to the moon, like, it’s just an assault.”  Lawrence has been outspoken about President Trump before he was even president. Back in 2015, she cried that it would be “the end of the world” if he took office, and told Trump “f**k you” during a 2016 televised talk show appearance. After he won the election, Lawrence penned an open letter to young women on the feminist side Broadly, that the election should “enrage them.”  “[L]ike Hillary, you can still be an inspiration and get important things done. Do not let this defeat you — let this enrage you! Let it motivate you! Let this be the fire you didn’t have before.

The former WWE wrester, 38, and the businessman, 43, secretly tied the knot in March 2014. They welcomed their first child, daughter Ava Grace, now 3, that August.  Three months after giving birth to their daughter, Keibler, who dated actor George Clooney from 2011 to 2013, revealed she never thought about marriage or parenthood until she started a relationship with her now-husband.  “Life can be unpredictable. You feel one way, and then … boom!” Keibler wrote on her lifestyle blog in December 2014. “You need to entirely change your perspective. That is certainly what happened to me this past year. Until I started dating Jared, the idea of being married and having a family was never on my radar. I was just hoping that the right love would find me.”  “But after a serendipitous reconnection with Jared, a friend who turned out to be my soulmate, we created a family together almost instantly,” she continued. “Talk about a serious change in my reality! This year and the holiday season especially has me feeling so nostalgic about family — my family, my new family, and of course, the newest addition to our family. Ava has graced us with such joy, such light and such love–we never saw it coming. She is our special little lady, and I couldn’t be more thankful for how she has opened my heart.”  The Dancing With the Stars season 2 alum has maintained a low profile since becoming a mother. In addition to shutting down her blog, Keibler has not updated her Instagram account since September 2015. The last post she shared on the social media platform was of herself reading a book titled “What Does It Mean to Be Kind?” to Ava.  Clooney, for his part, also started a family after his split from Keibler. The Oscar winner, 57, welcomed twins Alexander and Ella in June 2017 with his wife, Amal Clooney, whom he wed in September 2014.

Angie be careful what you wish for. Seems like 6 kids are going to be without a mom and dad in one place. Good luck with that","After attending the Academy Awards show, Jen's relationship with Brad took a negative turn. Previously, Angelina Jolie had made significant efforts to keep Brad away from Jen, going to great lengths to prevent any semblance of friendship between them. Her constant traveling was motivated by her desire to isolate Pitt from any potential connections. This extended to his own family as well. It was only a matter of time before this strategy backfired. Brad took longer than expected, but eventually saw the truth behind Angelina's extreme mental instability. This is likely why their children are not enrolled in school; she shares this same possessiveness over them. Angelina had likely believed her hold on Brad would last, given her confidence in her own attractiveness. However, her mistreatment and dismissal of Holly, who served as their surrogate, opened Brad's eyes to her manipulative ways. Furthermore, Jen's claims of constant communication with Brad made it evident that Angelina herself was still in contact with her exes. Years of trying to convince Brad that Jen was unworthy of him finally unraveled, as he realized the truth. Angelina's tactics of manipulation are no longer effective. Reports suggest that she possesses an intense jealousy and cannot tolerate Brad even glancing at an attractive woman. It is clear how challenging this can be. The National Enquirer claims that Brad is relieved to be separated from her. As Brad's closest friendships are with women, this would naturally create tension for Angelina, who begrudges sharing him. Angelina's decision to take on a film role greatly angered Brad, as she had promised to prioritize her role as a mother. It is apparent that she acts according to her own will, regardless of their agreement. Although they have twin babies, her commitment to bonding with them appears minimal. It is perplexing that any woman would not cherish the opportunity to spend quality time with her newborns. Such behavior is indeed troubling. The only thing preventing Brad from finalizing their separation is their children. Angelina should be cautious of her desires, as it seems that six kids may find themselves without the presence of both parents in one location. She will undoubtedly face challenges in managing this situation."

Palace insiders say it's this tight-knit circle of friends that has prompted the couple to focus their search on the Cotswolds rather than Norfolk, where William and Kate rule the roost at Anmer Hall, a grand Georgian pile boasting a swimming pool and tennis court. 'They don't want to be second-runners to Kate and William,' one source says. Locals have spotted the Prince — without his girlfriend — discreetly checking out several Cotswolds hotspots in recent months. The blacked-out Range Rovers driven by royal protection officers have been spotted navigating the country lanes around Cirencester and Stow-on-the-Wold, while Harry has apparently been sipping pints of bitter in low-key village pubs. £7.75million - Luckington Court, Chippenham, Wiltshire: This 11th-century house with original Tudor features is set in 157 acres of woodland and pasture, surrounded by a secure fence. There are eight bedrooms, four reception rooms, two kitchens, a music room, study and plenty of space for staff — a must for any royal retreat 'I'm not surprised he's moving here — he's in the local quite often,' says one resident. 'You'd see his security men sitting outside and you'd know he'd be in there.' Of course, there are practical reasons for moving to the Cotswolds. Harry's royal duties require him to be close to London and Toronto-based Meghan, whose time on the U.S. TV series Suits is coming to an end, wouldn't cope well with","Prince Harry, 33, and his girlfriend Meghan Markle, 36, have reportedly begun searching for a new home together. Rumor has it that the couple is particularly interested in high-end properties located in Oxfordshire, nestled within the picturesque countryside of the Cotswold hills. The Cotswolds hold special meaning for Prince Harry, as it is the area where he spent much of his childhood at Highgrove, the weekend home of his parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana. The allure of this region, with its lush green landscapes and rustic charm, has attracted a number of celebrities, politicians, and media executives, including the likes of the Camerons, Beckhams, Kate Moss, Lily Allen, and Stella McCartney. Not wanting to merely follow the crowd, Prince Harry is following his heart and seeking a place where he feels at home. The connections he has with the Cotswolds, such as family members and close friends who already reside there, make it an ideal location for the couple to establish their own roots. In recent months, the Prince has been spotted discreetly exploring the area, accompanied by his royal protection officers, checking out potential properties where he and Meghan could build a future together. The couple is said to be drawn to the Cotswolds' beauty, privacy, and serene surroundings, which provide a welcome escape from the demands of their public lives. With Prince Harry's requirements of being near London for his royal duties and Meghan's impending departure from her television career, the Cotswolds seems to be the perfect place for them to start their next chapter."
gossipcop-914729,"Teen Mom’s Briana DeJesus Shows Off Body Transformation After Plastic Surgery  After pregnancy, many moms are expected to bounce back to their pre-baby bodies.  While some women are able to lose pregnancy weight and regain their figures through diet and exercise, most women experience physical changes that may require additional help.  Fortunately, plastic surgeons are able to perform a mommy makeover to address sagging breasts, loose abdominal muscles and skin, and excess fat in the abdomen, flanks, hips, and thighs.  For most patients, a mommy makeover is something that they want to do to look and feel better about themselves.  Women may have friends that have had this procedure or know of celebrities or social media stars that have had a surgical body transformation. Such is the case with Teen Mom’s star Briana DeJesus, who recently underwent a Mommy Makeover procedure.  What Is a Mommy Makeover?  A mommy makeover includes several plastic surgeries, which may be performed at once, to help women reshape and contour their bodies after they have given birth.  Many patients will be treated with a breast lift, breast augmentation, tummy tuck, liposuction, and other body contouring treatments.  Who’s a Good Candidate?  Most plastic surgeons recommend that women have a mommy makeover once they are finished having children.  Many female patients may begin considering this series of surgeries anytime during their child-bearing years, but may delay treatment until after their last pregnancy.  Additionally, women that are breast-feeding will often wait until they have transitioned their child to a bottle or solid foods, before undergoing any type of surgery.  What Surgeries Are Involved?  A breast lift can tighten breast issue, remove excess skin, and resize or reposition the breast and areola for a perkier appearance. Women, especially those that breast feed, may also have a breast augmentation to address volume loss.  An abdominoplasty or tummy tuck tightens muscles, eliminates saggy skin, and creates a new belly button to restore feminine curves and a streamlined silhouette.  Additionally, liposuction may be perfumed on one or more areas of the body to target excess fat, and a Brazilian butt lift can boost a women’s less than pert backside.  For DeJesus, her doctor combined a tummy tuck with a breast lift.  “I did a tummy tuck, a breast lift with an implant exchange because she did have implants from before—she wanted to be smaller, higher and perkier—so we changed her implants out for smaller ones,” said Dr. Miami, via E! News. “And we also did some contouring and reshaping of her booty, of her shape overall. We did that, I think it was a week ago Monday.”  Recovery  Depending on the number of procedures, women may have one to four weeks of downtime following a mommy makeover. They can expect to be evaluated by their surgeon several times during this period.  Patients will receive detailed post-operative instructions from their treating physician including exercise and other physical restrictions. They will continue to be under the care of their plastic surgeon for routine follow-ups over the next 12-18 months.  Additionally, it’s important for patients to have physical and emotional support from their significant other, family, and friends during the recovery process.

It’s no secret that Jennifer Lopez-at 48-has a body that won’t quit and skin that needs to be studied so we can all age like the goddess she is.  Dramatic? Not even close.  And while a lot of it may be down to great genes, Lopez has revealed in a new interview some of her beauty secrets and yep, they’re as diva as you might expect.  Lopez credits her glow to positive affirmations, revealing she says one in particular to herself every day to keep her radiant, youthful look intact.  So what is this magic phrase?  “I am youthful and timeless at every age,” Lopez says every single day—but it’s not enough to just say the mantra daily, because Lopez also has a handful of pillows with these words and more mantras embroidered into them all over her home. “I tell myself that every day, a few times a day. It sounds like clichéd bullshit, but it’s not: Age is all in your mind. Look at Jane Fonda.”  Lopez continues, “The affirmations are everywhere. I forget that they’re all here. They’re just part of the house now.”  Before you scoff at Lopez’s positivity there is a school of thought that believes negative thoughts can age you. Australian-born Dr Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, co-authored The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer, with anti-aging psychologist Dr Elissa Epel, which investigated the link between telomeres, which protect our chromosomes, and the effect stress, sleep and diet can have on telomeres and how that directly corresponds with our health.  The book asserts there is a correlation between depression and anxiety and shorter telomeres and that “when pessimists develop an aging-related illness, like cancer or heart disease, the illness tends to progress faster.”  And really there's only so far a little highlight can go, step one is all about a positive attitude. Step two is to find yourself a great pillowcase and settle on your new mantra.  So what’s the lesson here?

It’s no secret that Jennifer Lopez-at 48-has a body that won’t quit and skin that needs to be studied so we can all age like the goddess she is.  Dramatic? Not even close.  And while a lot of it may be down to great genes, Lopez has revealed in a new interview some of her beauty secrets and yep, they’re as diva as you might expect.

Your inner glow is only a glass half full attitude away.","Jennifer Lopez, at the age of 48, possesses a remarkable physique and awe-inspiring skin that has captivated the attention of many. While some may attribute her beauty solely to her genetic makeup, Lopez has recently shared her beauty secrets in a revealing interview. These secrets, while perhaps channeling her diva persona, have proven to be effective in maintaining her radiant and youthful appearance.

One of the key factors that Lopez credits for her luminosity is the practice of positive affirmations. Every day, without fail, she recites a specific mantra to herself to uphold her youthful and timeless appearance. However, uttering these words alone is not enough for Lopez. She remains surrounded by a collection of pillows, adorned with various mantras, strategically placed throughout her home. By reinforcing her affirmations multiple times a day, Lopez firmly believes that age is merely a state of mind, referencing the timeless beauty of Jane Fonda as evidence.

Before we dismiss Lopez's positive mindset as mere whimsicality, it is important to acknowledge the scientific research that emphasizes the impact of negative thoughts on the aging process. The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer, authored by Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, and anti-aging psychologist Dr. Elissa Epel, delves into the connection between telomeres and various lifestyle factors such as stress, sleep quality, and diet. The book reveals that depression and anxiety are correlated with shorter telomeres, and individuals with pessimistic attitudes tend to experience accelerated progression of aging-related illnesses.

Given these compelling findings, it becomes evident that attitude plays a vital role in maintaining a youthful appearance. However, promoting a positive outlook is just the first step in this journey. The second step involves investing in a quality pillowcase that aligns with your newfound mantra. By embracing a glass-half-full mentality and practicing affirmation techniques, one can unlock their inner glow and radiate a youthful aura.

In conclusion, Jennifer Lopez's commitment to positive affirmations and her embellished pillows may seem eccentric at first glance, but scientific evidence supports the notion that cultivating a positive mindset can indeed contribute to a more youthful and vibrant appearance. The lesson here is clear: by adopting a positive attitude and investing in self-affirmation practices, we can enhance our inner radiance and embrace the potential for timeless beauty."
gossipcop-897530,"Instagram It’s strange to think that just over a year ago, only a handful of people truly considered themselves die-hard Timothée Chalamet stans. Ever since 2017’s awards season rolled around, the 22-year-old actor -- who stole our hearts by being dangerously charming in Call Me By Your Name and the ultimate face of fuccboi existentialism in Lady Bird -- has been that Hot Young Thing. It seems like everybody, whether they’re 15 or 50, gay or straight, man, woman or non-binary, is professing to be the New York native’s greatest admirer. The natural byproduct of a young actor being thrust suddenly into the spotlight nowadays, is that the fashion world fawns over them. When it comes time to suit up for awards ceremonies or to head out on the road for a massive promo tour, the fashion cognoscenti try and predict who will be gunning for gold, and reach out to forge relationships with the next generation of acting talent. He’s yet to be a campaign boy (Lucas Hedges and Charlie Plummer, for example, were the final faces of Kris van Assche’s Dior Homme), but Timothée’s already delivered some stellar red carpet looks thanks to a loyal link-up with menswear master Haider Ackermann. It’s a far cry from those high school days rocking snapbacks for his now infamous rap persona. But with each passing year, from cocky high school drama kid, to dressing modestly at schmoozy film events, to flat-out dominating the red carpets last awards season, Timothée has always proved that he’s a man of growth. These, in our humble opinion, are a selection of his most important looks; the ones that have acted as bookmarks in his style story from the very beginning. 2013: Lil Timmy Tim Okay, we don’t know about you, but we feel it’s unfair for anybody to judge the fashion choices of a kid, purely because we’ve all dressed like an absolute dickhead at some point in your lives. But Timothée Chalamet ain’t no normal kid -- he’s got a bloody Academy Award nomination! -- so we’ll start our journey at his first (and so far only) foray into the music world, with his now prolific Lil Timmy Tim act. At 17 years old, his fashion sense was clearly still in its formative stages. As he jumped on stage at LaGuardia High School’s Rising Stars of 2012 event, Dougy-ing like no white boy had ever Dougied before, Lil Timmy Tim decided to don a pair of MC Hammer-worthy white adidas sweats and a pastel-pink T-shirt. We’d call this the ultimate ‘ask for your number and never actually call you’ outfit, and as he strips the tee off to reveal a DIY vest bearing Nicki Minaj’s face on the back and his digits scrawled in Sharpie on the front, our worst fears are confirmed. In hindsight, this is a troubling but necessary step in Timothée’s fashion journey. We low-key love him for it anyway. 2014: Timmy’s first TIFF At this point in Timothée’s impending rise to fame, a full three years before Call Me By Your Name premiered, the then 18-year-old had shed the Lil Timmy Tim persona in favor of something a little less ostentatious. At the Toronto Film Festival premiere of his 2014 movie Men, Women and Children he left the sweatpants at home and opted for a modest, if crowd-pleasing, grey and white striped roll-neck. But if you thought he was going all conservative on us, think again! He kept it young by pairing it with some frayed black denim and camo-print desert boots. The hair, still a few years away from reaching its iconic tousled state, is channelling Jimmy Neutron in the most endearing way possible. 2014 TC? We stan. 2015: Soft florals for the Berlinale When we first started putting together this guide, we swore that Timothée wore nothing but suits for the entire duration of 2015, but among that endless slew of black lapels and loosely hanging ties, there lies this jacket, which we’re sort of into.

The billowy shirts; arse cheek-scraping short shorts; classic wayfarer sunglasses; jewelry bearing the Star of David -- all elements of Call Me By Your Name’s flawless wardrobe design that imbued Guadagnino’s queer love story with a stunning sense of sex, electricity, and romanticism. As soon as Elio’s outfits reached the public, inspiring thinkpieces a plenty, the world went gaga for his 1980s wardrobe. That vintage shirt from the final scene (you know, the one covered with faces on it) soon became the most sought-after piece for every London fashion queer’s wardrobe. Meanwhile, we spent this summer seeing men of all ages bin their board shorts in favor of the teeny-tiny kind instead. Timmy’s character’s impact -- as well as his older companion Oliver’s -- was wild. Of course, Timothée tried to pocket some of the film’s most coveted pieces, including an endless array of Lacoste polo shirts that belonged to the film’s producer, but wasn’t so lucky. Instead, all he got was a breakout role, an Oscar nomination and the promise of a lengthy career forever tethered to an encounter with a peach. 2017: Back to Berlin, a Berluti Boy By this point, just after its Sundance premiere, the film world was starting to go wild for Call Me By Your Name and Timothée was"

She has expressed that she sees it as a period of growth and believes that relationships can evolve into something better for all parties involved. However, recent developments indicate that the situation is not as harmonious as initially perceived. According to a source, Channing and Jenna have been unable to reach agreements during their divorce mediation sessions, leading to contentious meetings. One significant point of contention is the custody of their five-year-old daughter, Everly.

Finances also play a crucial role in their divorce proceedings. Channing, with his successful acting career that includes blockbuster hits like Magic Mike and 21 Jump Street, has amassed an estimated fortune of $60 million, making him the primary breadwinner.

The couple jointly acquired valuable assets throughout their marriage, including a $6 million Beverly Hills home and expensive cars such as a Tesla and a vintage Chevrolet truck. Dividing these assets has proven to be a challenging task, with both parties eager to bring an end to the process.

Jenna never anticipated that their divorce would reach this point.

Meanwhile, Tyga, an up-and-coming rapper, and model Blac Chyna welcomed their son King Cairo Stevenson in October 2012. Tyga shared his joy on Twitter, describing it as an incredible feeling. The couple confirmed their engagement later that year through an Instagram post featuring Chyna's impressive diamond ring.

In early 2012, shortly after his breakup with Rose, West began dating his longtime crush and friend, Kim Kardashian. Their relationship became a topic of public interest, with Kardashian's family eagerly seeking details about their romance. 

As West's romance with Kardashian blossomed, so did Rose's relationship with her new fiancé, Wiz Khalifa. In April 2012, West released the song ""Cold,"" wherein he confessed his love for Kardashian and his respect for Khalifa. 

Rose and Khalifa welcomed their first child, Sebastian, in February 2013 and secretly tied the knot in July that same year. The following month, they had a more elaborate ceremony, with Rose stunning everyone in a Pnina Tornai for Kleinfeld gown.

In June 2013, Kim Kardashian gave birth to their daughter, North West, following a complicated pregnancy. West dedicated the song ""Only One"" to his newborn daughter. 

Blac Chyna began appearing in Kim Kardashian's Instagram photos in 2014. As Kim strived to regain her pre-baby figure before her wedding to West, she posted gym selfies alongside Chyna. 

The high-profile couple tied the knot in May 2014 after gracing the cover of Vogue and celebrating with a luxurious European wedding weekend.

Things took an awkward turn when Rob Kardashian, Kim's younger brother, left her wedding festivities early. His behavior had become erratic, as he withdrew from the family's reality television show, gained significant weight, and battled depression. Rob has remained out of the public eye since then.

In August 2014, Blac Chyna and Tyga ended their relationship, aiming to keep things amicable due to their shared friendships with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian.

Rose, despite her previous intentions to spend her life with Khalifa, filed for divorce in September 2014, just 14 months after their marriage. She expressed her heartbreak on Twitter, revealing the pain she was experiencing.

During the fall of 2014, Tyga and Kylie Jenner, the youngest of the Kardashian-Jenner family, sparked dating rumors when they were frequently seen together. Although they never publicly acknowledged their romance due to Jenner's underage status at the time, the couple became the subject of speculation.

Following her split from Khalifa, Rose formed a close bond with Chyna, who had become estranged from Kim Kardashian due to the Tyga and Kylie dating rumors. Rose made her opinions known on The Breakfast Club radio show in February 2015, condemning Tyga's involvement with the much younger Jenner. 

Not one to stand by, Khloé Kardashian defended her sister on Twitter, engaging in a feud with Amber Rose. The exchange on social media highlighted the tension between Rose and the Kardashian-Jenner family."

Photo credit: BACKGRID","Ben Affleck is currently facing a crisis involving potential brain damage as a result of a recent motorcycle accident, as reported by RadarOnline.com. Friends of the 45-year-old actor express immense concern that he has pushed himself to dangerous limits following the end of his marriage to Jen Garner. Photos of the disturbing crash scene have been exclusively obtained by Radar, showcasing the severity of the incident. A peculiar twist of fate occurred when Affleck wrecked his new high-powered motorcycle, touted as the fastest in the world, on his way to church. The crash led to him hitting his head against a curb, although he managed to limp away from the accident. However, friends and medical experts fear that there may be long-term effects resulting from this collision. According to an unnamed source, Affleck's head absorbed most of the impact even though he was wearing a helmet. The true extent of the potential damage is unknown, but doctors believe that serious injuries could have occurred to his skull. Subdural hematoma, characterized by blood pooling and exerting pressure on the brain, is one possible consequence of such blunt force trauma. If untreated, this condition can lead to permanent brain damage or even death. Medical experts caution that the effects of the fall may not become apparent until they reach a life-threatening stage, making immediate attention crucial. Dr. Stuart Fischer, who has not treated Affleck, recommends thorough medical examinations such as X-rays or CT scans within 24 hours of head or neck trauma. Affleck's crash is not surprising to friends, who claim that he constantly embraces a high-octane lifestyle. His decades-long struggle with alcoholism, which led to his first rehab stint in 2001, has become well-known. Additionally, his affinity for blackjack has resulted in his expulsion from a prominent casino."

(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Ivanka Trump’s products weren’t always the hottest items online. In January, for instance, the first daughter’s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes. That changed dramatically the following month. Sales of Trump’s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst’s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before. Yes, Feb. 9 — the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump’s clothing and jewelry line on “Fox & Friends.” “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would tell you,” Conway said. “I’m going to give a free commercial here.

Sarah Tanner, Lyst’s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton’s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter’s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company.

According to Lyst, February drew unusually large numbers of orders across many Ivanka Trump-branded products, including dresses, shoes, pants, coats, knitwear and tops. Heels were the bestsellers, followed by dresses. “We’ve never seen such a large uptick,” Tanner said. “Typically, she’s not in our top 100 sellers.” Comparing February’s numbers with last year’s average number of orders of Ivanka Trump products shows a difference of 557 percent. (Tanner said company policy prohibits her from sharing the actual numbers of online sales.) The excitement of the brand, however, may be slumping. The company’s numbers show sales were gradually tapering off toward the end of February. March does not appear to be as remarkable, but sales are still on track to be about 8 percent better than they were in January, according to Lyst.

Some retailers have partially or completely distanced themselves from the Trump brand. Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and Belk have stopped selling Trump’s branded line of clothing, shoes and jewelry. T.J. Maxx and Marshalls have instructed employees to stop promoting Trump products in stores and to move Trump clothing into general merchandise racks. Sears Holdings and subsidiary Kmart discontinued online sales of 31 items from the Trump Home collection last month, though their websites still contain items sold by third-party sellers.","Ivanka Trump, despite not holding an official position in the Trump administration, is emerging as one of the most influential first children in American history. According to Forbes, her fashion line, initially not performing well, experienced a drastic change in February. Sales of Ivanka Trump's products on Lyst, the world's leading fashion e-commerce website, skyrocketed and made her the 11th most popular brand. The sales spike occurred on February 9th, the same day when White House counselor Kellyanne Conway openly endorsed Trump's clothing and jewelry line on ""Fox & Friends."" Apparently, viewers responded to Conway's endorsement, as sales soared by 219 percent from the previous day. Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, stated that the beginning of February was the best performing period in the brand's history, with some categories even achieving the best performance ever. Sales of Ivanka Trump's products tend to be influenced by current events, similar to how interest in pantsuits surged by 460 percent due to Hillary Clinton's preference for that style. When Donald Trump won the presidential election in November, sales of Ivanka Trump's products rose by 86 percent. Thus, it is plausible that Conway's endorsement played a significant role in the increase of sales for Ivanka Trump's brand. Lyst spokesperson Sarah Tanner acknowledged that the brand received significant media coverage in February. Conway's endorsement occurred after President Trump expressed dissatisfaction on Twitter about Nordstrom, a department store that dropped his daughter's clothing line due to sluggish sales. It is reasonable to assume that Conway's interview contributed to the surge in sales by generating substantial media attention for the brand. Both Democrats and Republicans criticized Conway's actions, as it seemed to violate an ethics rule forbidding federal employees from endorsing products while holding public office. Representative Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, stated that Conway had crossed the line and should be reprimanded. Although the White House insisted that Conway received counseling, concerns regarding her comments remain. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, criticized the White House for not taking disciplinary action against Conway. In a letter to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues, Shaub emphasized the importance of disciplinary action to deter future misconduct and ensure the integrity of the ethics program. Last month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway, highlighting her on-air endorsement of Trump's products as one of the reasons. Lyst reported unusually high numbers of orders for a wide range of Ivanka Trump-branded products in February, including dresses, shoes, pants, coats, knitwear, and tops. Heels were particularly popular, followed by dresses. Such a sharp increase in sales was unprecedented, as Ivanka Trump's products typically do not rank among the top 100 sellers on Lyst. Comparing February's sales with the average number of orders from last year revealed a remarkable difference of 557 percent. Although the excitement around the brand seemed to be declining toward the end of February, Lyst projected that sales in March would still exceed those of January by approximately 8 percent. Despite an aggressive boycott campaign called ""Grab Your Wallet,"" initiated in October 2016, the Ivanka Trump brand appears to have survived. The campaign encouraged shoppers to avoid retailers that carried Trump-branded products. Nevertheless, some retailers, such as Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, and Belk, ceased selling Trump's line entirely or partially distanced themselves from it. T.J. Maxx and Marshalls instructed employees not to promote Trump products in their stores and relocated Trump clothing to general merchandise racks. Sears Holdings and subsidiary Kmart stopped online sales of 31 items from the Trump Home collection, but third-party sellers still offer Trump-branded products on their websites."

But Daniel Craig may now be regretting his words, as he has confirmed he will, for one final time, play James Bond.  Speaking on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on US TV on Tuesday night, the actor finally put an end to the long-running saga of will he/won’t he play the character for a fifth time.  “I have been quite cagey about it. I have been doing interviews all day and people have been asking me and I think I’ve been rather coy. But kind of felt like if I was going to speak the truth I should speak truth to you.”  Asked by Colbert directly whether he could deliver some “good news” about returning as Bond, Craig finally replied: “Yes.”  He revealed he had known for a “couple of months”, adding: “We’ve been discussing it, we’ve just been trying to figure things out. I always wanted to, I needed a break.”  However, he was keen to reiterate it would indeed be his last outing as the lothario spy. “I think this is it. I just want to go out on a high note and I can’t wait,” he said.  It is not surprising news, as his return was first reported in July. However, Craig’s renewed enthusiasm for the role marks a change of mind after comments he made in 2015, following the release of Spectre.  Edan Clay (@EdanClay) Thank f*cking GAWD! Daniel Craig is coming back as BOND!  Hurry the f*ck up!!! pic.twitter.com/tx8MqPhpnR  The film garnered rave reviews but Craig, clearly frustrated with the promotional commitments that accompanied playing Bond, said he would rather “slit my wrists” than reprise the role.  “I’m over it at the moment. We’re done. All I want to do is move on,” he said, adding: “If I did another Bond movie, it would only be for the money.”  But explaining his heated comments, Craig told Colbert that they had been made in the moment, two days after Spectre had finished shooting when he was exhausted. “Instead of saying something with style and grace, I said something really stupid,” he said.  It is the source of much speculation of how much the film studios will have promised Craig to tempt him back. He was rumoured to have been paid $65m (£48.66m) for Spectre, and in 2016 it was reported he had been offered $150m to shoot two more Bond films, almost back to back.

Elba said he was already weary of the attention that the speculation had attracted. “I’m probably the most famous Bond actor in the world, and I’ve not even played the role,” he said in 2015. “Enough is enough.

As fans contemplate the future of this love story, let's take a reflective look at the journey of Jelena thus far. The book of Jelena began in December 2010 when Justin and Selena were seen holding hands in Philadelphia. This moment marked the start of an impactful chapter in their lives. Throughout the years, they faced numerous breakup speculations, with one notable incident in November 2011 when Justin was involved in a paternity suit that was eventually dropped.

Despite occasional breakup rumors, Jelena appeared together at the premiere of Katy Perry: Part of Me in June 2012. October 2012 brought a cryptic photo from Justin, fueling speculation of a single status. Reports in November 2012 indicated a breakup between Justin and Selena due to their busy schedules. During this time, Justin was briefly related to Victoria's Secret model Barbara Palvin and later Miranda Kerr, but Barbara clarified on Twitter that they were merely friends. Immediately after kissing in an airport in Salt Lake City, Jelena's relationship reportedly ended in December 2012 during their New Year's Eve vacation in Mexico. Selena tweeted about new beginnings and a fresh start. In January 2013, Selena indirectly mentioned Justin by sporting a hat representing his hometown hockey team. March 2013 saw Selena suggesting a lack of heartbreak during an interview, while in April, she reportedly flew to Norway to visit Justin. However, the photo he shared on Instagram in response was promptly deleted. In May 2013, Selena greeted Justin with a kiss on the cheek at the Billboard Music Awards, which drew a reaction from Taylor Swift. Although they spent Fourth of July together, Selena claimed to be ""single"" in a subsequent interview. Justin kicked off January 2014 with an affectionate photo of Selena hugging him, expressing his love for her. In March, they appeared in videos where they could be seen dancing, although these were soon removed. Justin also shared photos of Selena from the Vanity Fair Oscar party, lavishing her with admiration. During April 2014, rumors circulated about a fight between Justin and Selena at Coachella, sparked by photos of Kylie Jenner found on Justin's phone. Selena was later linked to Orlando Bloom. In June, Justin posted and deleted another black and white photo with Selena, highlighting their unconditional love. They were subsequently seen together at various events, reinforcing the notion of a rekindled romance. At the same time, Justin faced criticism for a racist joke shown on video, with reports suggesting that Selena stood by him during this controversy. July 2014 brought an altercation between Justin and Orlando in Ibiza, evidenced by a widely circulated video. This incident was accompanied by Justin posting and deleting a provocative photo of Miranda Kerr on Instagram. In August, Justin shared a photo of himself with Selena, hinting at a renewed connection. In October, a public argument between Justin and Selena erupted at a French airport, leading Selena to tweet about loneliness. Rumors circulated that Kendall Jenner played a role in their breakup, while Justin attempted to win Selena back through romantic social media posts. In November, Selena released a song titled ""The Heart Wants What It Wants,"" confirming it was about Justin during an interview with Ryan Seacrest. Selena expressed her support for Justin and revealed it was difficult for him to watch the accompanying video. Justin responded to the song on Instagram. At the American Music Awards, Selena performed ""The Heart Wants What It Wants."""
gossipcop-780888,"Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn’t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family’s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million — as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.  What is the ‘Kate effect’?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world. While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as “the Kate Effect,” ",0,en,0,"Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.

Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.

Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall.

Exiting #ParisAgreement imperils US security and our ability","In response to President Donald Trump's announcement of the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, Hollywood figures swiftly expressed their concerns. Former Vice President Al Gore labeled the decision ""reckless and indefensible,"" emphasizing how it compromises America's global standing and endangers our ability to address the urgent climate crisis. Gore stated that if the President fails to lead, the American people will step up. The Weather Channel even updated its homepage to address the potential consequences of this announcement.

Leonardo DiCaprio, who previously urged world leaders to join the Paris Agreement, voiced his disappointment on Twitter and called for collective action. Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, announced his resignation from Trump's advisory councils, citing the damaging effects that leaving the Paris accord will have on America and the world.

Actor Kal Penn, who served in the White House Office of Public Engagement during the Obama administration, encouraged activism, urging individuals to take action and not just be angered by the situation. Jon Favreau, Obama's former chief speechwriter, highlighted potential motives behind President Trump's decision, drawing attention to commentator Ann Coulter's remark that it was primarily to provoke opposition.

Renowned director Ava DuVernay expressed her disapproval with a concise but powerful word: ""Shameful."" Bette Midler criticized the press for their role in electing what she deemed a destructive President. Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson took a broader swipe at the entirety of Trump's administration, suggesting that their lack of understanding of science may be a factor in this ill-advised move.

Filmmaker and activist Michael Moore unleashed a string of messages highlighting the severity of Trump's decision and referred to it as a crime against humanity. Jeff Immelt, CEO of General Electric, stressed that climate change is a genuine concern and emphasized the need for industry to lead in the absence of governmental support.

Molly McNearney, wife of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, discredited climate change deniers by drawing a parallel between their denial and previous misconceptions about harmful substances, such as tobacco.

These are just some of the reactions to the President's decision, reflecting the deep concern and disappointment among various industry figures. Their sentiments demonstrate the impact and importance of the Paris climate accord, beyond just environmental considerations, and how this withdrawal places America and the world in jeopardy."

gossipcop-911679,"EXCLUSIVE: In a very competitive situation, Netflix has landed The Politician, a new hourlong comedy series from longtime collaborators Brad Falchuk, Ian Brennan and Ryan Murphy, I have learned. The project, starring Tony winner Ben Platt (Dear Evan Hansen), with Oscar winners Barbra Streisand and Gwyneth Paltrow in negotiations to co-star, has received a two-season straight-to-series order, I hear.  The deal, believed to be the biggest TV package sale of the year, came after a weeklong bidding war among top streaming players, including Amazon and Hulu, sources said. It gives prolific creator-producer Murphy two series on Netflix, along with the upcoming Ratched.  RESX/Shutterstock  As he does on all of his shows, Murphy will direct the pilot for The Politician, described as a one-hour comedy with social commentary. If Streisand and Paltrow’s deals close, Streisand will be part of the production team as well as directing, with Paltrow also expected to produce. It would be the first major TV series role for both feature actress.  Details about the plot and characters in The Politician are being kept under wraps, but according to a source close to the project, it revolves around the politician aspirations of Platt’s Payton, a wealthy Santa Barbarian, and every season will revolve around a different political race his character is involved in.  Rex/Shutterstock  I hear that Platt will have musical numbers in several episodes of the show. That, along with the potential involvement of Paltrow and Streisand, helped drive interest in the project, sparking a heated bidding and leading to the big Netflix deal.  Frequent collaborators Falchuk and Murphy had been quietly working on the script for The Politician for the past year. The two brought in their Glee co-creator Brennan, with the three expected to share co-creator credit. Platt also was attached early on and is heavily involved in the casting of the series, which eyes a potential late summer production start.  The project hails from Fox 21 TV Studios under Murphy’s overall deal at 20th Century Fox TV. Its packaging was guided by Fox TV Group chairman Dana Walden, a longtime Murphy collaborator who oversees the studio.  Paltrow previously worked on Falchuk, Murphy and Brennan’s Glee. The actress, who is engaged to Falchuk, won an Emmy for her guest-starring role on Fox’s high school musical dramedy.  The deal for The Politician comes on the heels of the successful launch of Falchuk and Murphy’s latest collaboration, drama series 9-1-1 (co-created with Tim Minear), which has been a breakout hit for Fox and was renewed for a second season only two episodes into its freshman run. The Politician marks Murphy and Falchuk’s fourth television series as co-creators, joining 9-1-1 as well as FX’s American Horror Story and the upcoming Pose (co-created by Steven Canals). Murphy is also the mastermind behind FX’s American Crime Story and Feud as well as Netflix’s upcoming Ratched starring Emmy winner Sarah Paulson (AHS franchise, People v. O.J. Simpson) as a younger version of the diabolical Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.  Netflix  Netflix has emerged as the streaming home of Murphy by snagging both of his series to hit the premium space in the past five months. The latest development is sure to further fuel speculation about the future of Murphy, one of the top creator-producers working in television today who has pulled off the rare feat of launching commercial and award-winning hits on both broadcast and cable. Netflix has been widely rumored to be among a slew of suitors for Murphy, whose current deal with 20th Century Fox TV expires later this year.  “I haven’t made a decision of where I’m going to go, I’m going to sit back and wait,” Murphy said at TCA last month when asked whether he would stay at the studio, which is in the process of being acquired by Disney.

Jennifer Holliday is backing out of performing at Trump's inauguration celebration after receiving backlash from her fans. Kareem Quow for KQ Photography  Holliday, best known for her Tony-winning role in Broadway's ""Dreamgirls,"" faced pressure from her gay, lesbian and black fans when it was announced she would sing at a Thursday concert at Washington's Lincoln Memorial.  Holliday said in a statement Saturday that she apologized for her lapse of judgment, for being uneducated on the issues and causing heartbreak for her fans.  Several prominent entertainers have declined to perform at Trump inaugural festivities. Country star Toby Keith and actor Jon Voigt are in the lineup for Thursday's concert.  Holliday's reversal was first reported by The Wrap; the publication obtained a letter Holliday wrote to her fans. Her representative, Bill Carpenter, confirmed the details in the letter to The Associated Press.  ""My only choice must now be to stand with the LGBT Community and to state unequivocally that I WILL NOT PERFORM FOR THE WELCOME CONCERT OR FOR ANY OF THE INAUGURATION FESTIVITIES!"" she wrote.  ""Please know that I HEAR YOU and I feel your pain. The LGBT Community was mostly responsible for birthing my career and I am deeply indebted to you,"" she added. ""You have loved me faithfully and unconditionally and for so many years you provided me with work even though my star had long since faded.""

""I didn't see it as singing for Trump; I saw it as singing for the people on the mall,"" Holliday told the AP.  The performer, who most recently starred on Broadway in ""The Color Purple,"" said she was hurt by the angry backlash, which included calls to boycott her music. Others called her ""Uncle Tom"" and there was even a suggestion that she take her own life.  ""It just really made my heart drop to my feet,"" Holliday said.

In a statement released on Saturday, Holliday expressed regret for her lack of understanding regarding the implications of her participation, which was interpreted as a show of support for President-elect Donald Trump. The announcement comes after the acclaimed actress faced pressure from her gay, lesbian, and black fan base upon the announcement of her involvement in the Lincoln Memorial concert scheduled for Thursday in Washington. It should be noted that several notable entertainers have also declined to perform at the Trump inaugural festivities, while some, such as country star Toby Keith and actor Jon Voigt, remain in the lineup for the concert. Holliday's reversal was initially reported by The Wrap, which obtained a letter she wrote addressed to her fans. Her representative later confirmed the authenticity of the letter to The Associated Press. In the heartfelt letter, Holliday pledged her support to the LGBT community and firmly stated her decision not to perform at any of the inauguration festivities. She expressed her deep gratitude and indebtedness to her fans, particularly from the LGBT community, who showed unwavering support throughout her career. Though the controversy has garnered attention, it is worth noting that Trump's inaugural festivities lack the celebrity attendance seen at former President Barack Obama's inaugurations, where A-list stars such as Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen, and U2 performed. Trump, however, has emphasized that the focus of the swearing-in celebrations should be on the people rather than the presence of high-profile entertainers."

While public debate rages about Donald Trump’s health, Melania has told friends and associates that the once robust and high energy man she knew and loved has been replaced with a “slower, damaged version”.  “By 8pm he is slurring,” she said. “This is not the man I know.”  Fearing that the sedatives are being pumped into the body of the POTUS via Coca-Cola that he orders by pressing a button he had installed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Melania has insisted he stop drinking from the tap and instead revert to drinking from cans she brings herself.  “Donald’s heath improved out of sight when he stopped drinking from the tap,” Melania said.  However the First Lady fears the active campaign to poison the president is “a high level operation” and “not the work of a solitary loon.”  Melania is popular in the White House—as she is with the rest of the country—and she has befriended senior intelligence agency staff who remain loyal to president. They have educated her about Ronald Regan’s poisoning by the Deep State after his assassination attempt in 1981. They have also warned her that George W. Bush was reduced to a “brain damaged” state after years of steady poisoning.  But the advantage Trump may hold over his GOP predecessors in the Oval Office is that he has a wife who is wise to the ruse and is insisting he watch his food and drink intake closely for signs of adulteration.  Donald Trump’s food choices say a lot about the man. The president’s Howard Hughes-level pickiness when it comes to food is partly motivated by a desire to avoid being poisoned, according to Melania. He doesn’t trust those around him – and rightfully so.  As President Trump knows all too well, there are enemies of the state dug in deep at the White House.  Reporters from TIME recently got a glimpse behind-the-scenes at the White House, where they reported on what goes down at the president’s dinner table. Of particular interest was a meal enjoyed by the reporters, Trump, and Vice President Pence.  Pence’s meal was not unusual—he ate what everyone else did.

But the POTUS received a meal fully customized to his own preferences, and closely observed by Melania who insisted on watching the chef prepare the meal with ingredients she provided herself.","According to reports, First Lady Melania Trump has recently expressed concerns about a potential poisoning threat in the White House. Melania believes that her husband, President Donald Trump, may be slowly poisoned with sedatives that are smuggled into his drinks. Worried about his declining health, Melania has confided in friends and associates that the once energetic President she knew and loved has become a slower and damaged version of himself. She noted that by 8pm, he often experiences slurring speech, which deeply worries her.

In an attempt to safeguard the President's well-being, Melania suspects that the sedatives are being added to President Trump's favorite Coca-Cola drinks, which are conveniently delivered to him via a button he had installed on his desk. In an effort to prevent any possible tampering, Melania has urged him to stop drinking directly from the tap and instead opt for cans that she personally provides. Surprisingly, this change in drinking habits has resulted in a noticeable improvement in the President's health, according to Melania.

However, the First Lady believes that the campaign to poison her husband is not the work of a solitary individual, but rather a sophisticated operation conducted by a group or organization of high prominence. Melania, who is well-liked in the White House and has established friendships with senior intelligence agency staff loyal to her husband, has been educated on previous instances of poisoning in the political sphere. She was informed about the poisoning attempt of Ronald Reagan after his assassination attempt in 1981, as well as the alleged gradual poisoning of George W. Bush, which led to his diminished cognitive abilities.

Unlike his predecessors, President Trump may have an advantage in the form of Melania, who is keenly aware of the potential dangers and insists that he closely monitors his food and drink intake for any signs of adulteration. Melania has revealed that her husband's discerning food choices stem from a deep-rooted concern about being poisoned, as he holds a level of mistrust toward those around him—a sentiment that Melania believes is justified. She is fully aware that the White House harbors individuals who pose as enemies to the security and wellbeing of the state.

Recently, TIME magazine managed to gain insight into the President's dining experiences at the White House. During a particular meal attended by reporters, President Trump and Vice President Pence, it was observed that while Pence's meal was ordinary, Trump's was fully customized to his specific preferences. Melania closely watched the chef prepare the President's meal using ingredients that she personally provided, ensuring utmost vigilance against any potential threats.

Melania's unwavering commitment to President Trump's safety and well-being demonstrates her dedication as a First Lady. Her understanding of the risks and her proactive approach in protecting her husband from any potential harm is a testament to her astuteness and concern for his welfare."

In fact, there has not been any confirmation that Tom Cruise has dated anyone since Katie Holmes.  Alberto E. Rodriguez / Getty Images  Katie Holmes, however, continues to attempt to keep her romance with Jamie Foxx a secret, despite the fact that the pair has been spotted on numerous occasions over the past year on beach getaways and romantic locales like Paris. Most recently the mysterious duo were spotted celebrating Jamie’s 50th birthday at a Santa Monica beach hotel last week, as Page Six relays.  Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx were spotted on another romantic beach getaway https://t.co/ZwdutxFdYe pic.twitter.com/dhoszJ2wg3 — Travel + Leisure (@TravelLeisure) December 19, 2017  Onlookers at the hotel stated that the duo appeared to be quite awkward while Katie kept looking around cautiously. The couple was also seen walking along the beach while Foxx had his arm around the beauty. This report is similar to the one earlier this year that stated Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx were spotted strolling along the beach hand-in-hand in Malibu.","Tom Cruise, known for his successful movie career, has recently found himself amid dating rumors following the end of his marriage to Katie Holmes. However, all previous rumors linking him to various individuals have been proven false. Nonetheless, recent claims suggest that members of the Church of Scientology have once again been involved in setting up the actor with potential partners. It has been reported that Cruise has been secretly dating, adopting a disguise similar to the one Holmes used in the early stages of her relationship with Jamie Foxx. According to a source, Cruise's familiar face makes it difficult for him to go unnoticed, prompting him to have a silicone mask created by his makeup artist. To maintain authenticity, the mask, along with makeup, takes approximately five hours to apply. However, Gossip Cop has dismissed these claims as completely untrue, emphasizing that there is no confirmation of Cruise dating anyone since his split from Holmes. In contrast, Holmes continues to keep her relationship with Foxx hidden, despite being frequently spotted together on vacations and in romantic settings. Recently, the couple celebrated Foxx's birthday at a Santa Monica beach hotel, where onlookers commented on their cautious behavior. They were seen walking along the beach with Foxx's arm around Holmes, reminiscent of previous reports of their hand-in-hand stroll in Malibu."

Raised in SoHo and on the Lower East Side by a father descended from Spanish nobility and a mother who is a policy analyst on women’s issues in Third World countries, de la Huerta had been acting and modeling since her teens, and now seemed to be breaking through. The year before she had co-starred in Gaspar Noé’s Enter the Void, which had recently opened in the U.S. And her recurring role on HBO’s just-premiered Prohibition-period gangster drama, Boardwalk Empire, as mistress to Steve Buscemi’s Enoch “Nucky” Thompson, had earned her critical praise.  One night that November, de la Huerta ran into Harvey Weinstein at the Top of the Standard bar at the Standard, High Line hotel in Manhattan. She had first met Weinstein while making the movie Cider House Rules when she was 14. De la Huerta had communicated with the producer over the years after their first meeting. At around age 21, she said, Weinstein sent her some science-fiction books and suggested she might be right for a role in one of his projects. When they met at the hotel in 2010 de la Huerta was 26 and Weinstein was at the height of his powers as an Oscar-winning producer. The Weinstein Company was about to enter a streak that would see it win best picture at the Academy Awards two years in a row, first for The King’s Speech in 2011 and then The Artist in 2012. Weinstein offered de la Huerta a ride home to Tribeca. In de la Huerta’s account of the night, Weinstein arrived at her apartment demanding to come inside and have a drink. “Things got very uncomfortable very fast,” the actress, now 33, told Vanity Fair in a phone interview on Wednesday.  “Immediately when we got inside the house, he started to kiss me and I kind of brushed [him] away,” de la Huerta said. “Then he pushed me onto the bed and his pants were down and he lifted up my skirt. I felt afraid. . . . It wasn’t consensual . . . It happened very quickly. . . . He stuck himself inside me. . . . When he was done he said he’d be calling me. I kind of just laid on the bed in shock.”  De la Huerta described a second assault that allegedly happened in late December 2010, when Weinstein showed up in her building lobby after she came home from a photo shoot. The actress said she had been drinking, and was frightened by Weinstein, who had been repeatedly calling her, despite her asking him to leave her alone. “He hushed me and said, ‘Let’s talk about this in your apartment,’” de la Huerta said. “I was in no state. I was so terrified of him. . . . I did say no, and when he was on top of me I said, ‘I don’t want to do this.’ He kept humping me and it was disgusting. He’s like a pig. . . .

gossipcop-866076,"CLOSE Jay-Z's new album ‘4:44’ is basically his reaction to Beyoncé's 'Lemonade.' USA TODAY  As part of his apology tour surrounding his new album 4:44, Jay-Z admitted an uncomfortable new truth about his marriage — and he's getting other male celebrities to do the same.  The rapper is releasing a series of Tidal documentaries digging deeper into specific tracks from 4:44, which dropped earlier this month. The latest video, Footnotes for 4:44, is an 11-minute clip released Monday featuring celebrities including Jesse Williams, Chris Rock, Will Smith, Kendrick Lamar, Aziz Ansari and Mahershala Ali discussing race, relationships and masculinity.  For his part, Jay got candid about his sometimes-troubled relations with Beyonce, after spending a considerable part of 4:44 owning up to the misdeeds she sang about on Lemonade.  “This is my real life,"" he said. ""I just ran into this place and we built this big, beautiful mansion of a relationship that wasn’t totally built on the 100% truth and it starts cracking.""

Sources who have viewed the video state that it consists of multiple clips. The initial clip showcases Kevin and a woman in a club, engaging in intimate behavior. The video then transitions to a bedroom scene, where the individuals are not visible, but suggestive sounds can be heard in the background. The second clip does not feature Kevin, while the third clip captures two individuals, with one resembling Kevin. 

We have been informed that the person supposedly extorting Kevin has demanded payment from him to prevent the release of the video. In response to this troubling development, Kevin Hart has taken the initiative by publicly apologizing to his wife and children. He expressed deep regret for his recent mistakes in an Instagram post, emphasizing his commitment to rectifying the situation. 

According to TMZ sources, a woman claims to have recorded a video involving Kevin, showcasing sexually suggestive behavior. It should be noted that this is not a sex tape but rather appears to be a prelude to such activity. Notably, during the most explicit moments of the video, Kevin cannot be visibly identified. 

A spokesperson for Kevin has stated, ""Someone attempted to set Kevin up in a failed extortion scheme. As law enforcement is now involved, we are unable to provide further details to avoid compromising the ongoing investigation."""

Nelson, who still goes by her married name on social media, shared a tearful selfie on Thursday with the caption, ""PSA: If Staci Felker can make it through this week, so can you.""","Blake Shelton appears to be entangled in a complex web of personal relationships that tests the concept of karma. Recent events have sparked controversy surrounding the country singer, as he sent out a cryptic tweet referencing karma just as news broke that his ex-wife Miranda Lambert was allegedly involved with a married man. In his tweet, Shelton proclaimed his adherence to the high road for a significant period of time, yet expressed a newfound belief in the workings of karma. This statement was made after multiple outlets reported that Lambert had begun dating Evan Felker, the married frontman of Turnpike Troubadours.

However, Lambert's ex-boyfriend Jeff Allen has shed light on Shelton's past, asserting that the singer is not as blameless as he may want to appear. Allen recently tweeted, but later deleted, a post calling out Shelton for engaging in a romantic relationship with Lambert while Shelton himself was still married to his first wife, Kaynette Williams, back in 2006. Allen's tweet revealed his discontent with Shelton's audacity in invoking karma, stating, ""You know, I’ve always given you the benefit of the doubt and chalked it up to just being human, but you must be one arrogant SOB to pop off something like this when I know damn good and well you were cheating on your wife and Miranda was cheating on me when you two started up."" Despite holding his silence for over a decade, Allen felt compelled to share his frustrations, asserting that the notion of karma held no relevance for Shelton's actions towards him.

Allen's comments serve to shed light on the complexities of the situation, but he also acknowledged that his feelings towards Lambert remain positive. He described her as a loving, caring person and a good girlfriend, indicating his lack of animosity towards her in light of their past. Representatives for both Lambert and Shelton did not provide any comment in response to Fox News' inquiries.

Reports have surfaced regarding the origin of Lambert and Shelton's relationship, with allegations of it beginning as an affair. However, both singers have consistently denied these claims in the past. Their romantic journey commenced with an engagement in May 2010, followed by their wedding in Texas the following year. Unfortunately, after four years of marriage, the two musicians announced their divorce in July 2015.

Recent developments indicate that Lambert, who recently ended her two-year relationship with Anderson East, began a romantic involvement with Felker when his band joined her ""Livin’ Like Hippies"" tour in January. It is worth noting that Felker was married to global strategist Staci Nelson in September 2016. However, it appears their relationship has reached a pivotal juncture, as Felker filed for divorce on February 16th, followed by Nelson's filing 12 days later. Nelson, who continues to use her married name on social media, recently shared a tearful selfie along with a caption that reads, ""PSA: If Staci Felker can make it through this week, so can you.""

In conclusion, the ongoing saga involving Blake Shelton, Miranda Lambert, and Evan Felker continues to captivate audiences and raise questions about the concept of karma. While Shelton's recent tweet displays his belief in the workings of karma, Jeff Allen's tweet highlights the complexities of their intertwined past. Despite the lack of comment from Lambert and Shelton's representatives, the couple's previous denial of an affair adds another layer of intrigue to their history. Ultimately, it remains unclear how these relationships will unfold, as recent divorce filings and emotional social media posts further entangle this narrative."

A third pregnancy was not in the cards for Kardashian: She suffered from placenta accreta in her first pregnancy, a painful and potentially life-threatening condition that makes giving birth difficult because the placenta is attached too deeply to the uterine wall.  Kardashian detailed on her blog how her doctor had to insert his arm inside her to scrape the placenta from her womb after delivering her first baby.  ""How disgusting and painful!!! My mom was crying; she had never seen anything like this before,"" she wrote. ""It was the most painful experience of my life!""  Kardashian's recent discussions on the show about her desire for another baby have also involved her sister, Khloé, who offered to act as a surrogate until they went to a fertility specialist who found Khloe has fertility problems of her own.  Chrissy Teigen also offered to act as Kim's surrogate, telling Access Hollywood that she would do it in ""a heartbeat.""  “I really enjoyed the pregnancy process,"" said Teigen, 30, and a new mom herself.

gossipcop-913462,"May we never forget the bizarre story that set Bachelor Nation ablaze: The Bachelor's Bekah M. was reported missing, yes, full on listed as a missing person in Humboldt County, California, even while people were watching her on the show. Though she has commented on it via Twitter in the past, as it turns out, why Bekah M. was reported missing is a totally relatable story. While appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Kimmel interviewed Bekah M., or Bekah Martinez, over a video call. After he asked if she got her pink fringed earrings from the marijuana farm — the North Coast Journal reported that the former Bachelor contestant had gone to Humboldt to work on a marijuana farm — Martinez got a chance to explain the whole story.  TheNorth Coast Journal listed her as a missing person in Humboldt County, California on Feb. 1. (The Northern California newspaper reported Bekah M. as being one of the ""Humboldt 35,"" which included a list of 34 other missing persons. The list is now down to 33, according to the Journal, thanks to Bekah M. being accounted for.) ""First of all,"" she told Kimmel. ""A lot of people thought I lied to my mother saying I was on a farm when I was actually on the Bachelor but no, I had already been eliminated from the show.""  ABC/YouTube  According to the missing persons report, Martinez left for Northern California on Nov. 12, and her mother reported that she'd been missing on Nov. 18 after not heard from her daughter. Since The Bachelor began filming on Sept. 20, and now everyone knows that Martinez was eliminated after the seventh week, that means that she left the show sometime in early Nov. 2017. The fact that she then went away to have a fun week with her friends makes sense, but it also led to some of the confusion as to why she'd gone MIA since many people suspected that Bekah M. was chosen by Arie Luyendyk, Jr. on The Bachelor.  After all, since Bachelor contestants have strict rules about phone usage, it made sense that Bekah M. would not call her mom for a few days in a row. And, since Nov. 18 would likely be when The Bachelor was wrapping up, it made fans think that she had made it to the final two — or that she was the one Luyendyk picked.  But, as it turns out, Bekah M. had been eliminated and she simply went away. ""I just decided to go up to the mountains with friends for a couple weeks and I was there for six or seven days without phone service,"" she told Kimmel. ""I thought that I was going to have phone service, and I told my mother that I would. I just had this weird feeling on the six or seventh day and I was like 'I need to go home now' so I got in my car, drove to where I had service, called my parents, and then come to find out only 12 hours before, my mother had called the Humboldt Sheriff's Department saying that I was missing.""  As for why the North Coast Journal reported that Martinez was on a marijuana farm when she'd just told Kimmel she wanted to go to the mountains, well, you'd have to know a bit about the local geography. ""I was on a marijuana farm?"" she said before laughing and then explaining, "" It's Humboldt County."" In case you're not from California, you should probably know that Humboldt County is densely populated with marijuana farms. Her simple explanation makes sense, and she also clarified to Kimmel that she's still a nanny in Los Angeles and not a weed farmer.  Besides the much-needed clarification, one of the best revelations to come from Bekah M.'s appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live was the fact that the Bachelor contestant remained close with Kendall. It even sounds like she has stayed close with most of the contestants from Arie's Bachelor season, except Tia, who played a big part in Martinez's elimination. Hopefully, this means that the young Bachelor contestant will come back for Bachelor in Paradise.

Gwen Stefani Needs a Sweet Escape, Calls off Wedding to Blake Shelton  Tarek and Christina El Moussa's Divorce Details Are Messy AF — So We Broke It All Down for You  Miranda Lambert Shades Blake Shelton With ""Little Red Wagon"" Lyrics","In a recent development, it has come to light that the relationship between music's hottest couple, Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani, has come to an end. According to exclusive information obtained by In Touch, Shelton decided to end the relationship before embarking on his tour in February, leaving Stefani feeling heartbroken and confused. Despite a recent photo posted by Stefani featuring Shelton on social media, it appears to be an attempt to ignore the truth of their separation. Another insider reveals that while Stefani continues to show her support for Shelton online, he has significantly reduced communication with her. This lack of reciprocation has left Stefani even more distraught.

The source explains that Shelton's decision to end the relationship stems from his frustration with Stefani's neediness, as well as the ongoing drama involving her ex-husband and her jealousy towards other women. In particular, Stefani's jealousy over Shelton's friendship with The Voice winner, Chloe Kohanski, became a breaking point in their relationship. Stefani expressed her concerns about living in constant fear of Shelton's potential infidelity, which ultimately led to his decision to continue his month-long Country Freaks Tour without her.

The breakup took an emotional toll on Stefani, as she was accustomed to accompanying Shelton on tour. After a heated argument, Shelton left without even saying goodbye, further intensifying the pain and upheaval in their relationship. Adding to Stefani's distress, it has been discovered that Shelton has sought solace in his newly-single ex-wife, Miranda Lambert. According to an insider, Lambert reached out to Shelton and they have since formed a close friendship, providing support and sharing intimate details of their lives. The news of Shelton and Lambert's newfound closeness surely adds another layer of complexity to Stefani's already heart-wrenching situation.

In conclusion, the end of Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani's relationship has left Stefani devastated and struggling to come to terms with the breakup. Shelton's decision was influenced by Stefani's insecurities and their ongoing disputes over trust. The abrupt departure and subsequent emotional support sought by Shelton from his ex-wife serve to further compound Stefani's emotional turmoil. It remains to be seen how she will cope with this unexpected turn of events."

In an effort to document her recovery process, the renowned actress shared a video on her Instagram Story where she can be seen applying ice to her healing shoulder. In a rather lighthearted manner, Cuoco mentions that it's the third consecutive day she's worn the same shirt, while a bag of ice cubes rests comfortably on her shoulder. She even teases her husband Karl about the need to redo her hairstyles, stating that it could be the inspiration for a sitcom. In addition to the video, Cuoco emphasizes the significance of ice in her healing journey, describing it as her ""best friend"" at the moment.

In another video, Cuoco amusingly shares how her dog Ruby is benefiting from her forced downtime while she recovers from the procedure. She jests that Ruby is quite content with her constant presence, allowing her to lay and stare at Cuoco for hours on end. Cuoco jokingly inquires if this is Ruby's ultimate dream come true.

Contrary to popular belief, Cuoco clarifies that the surgery was not the result of a spontaneous injury. Rather, it was a premeditated decision she made over a year ago. She explains through her Instagram Story that she had injured her shoulder more than a year ago, and though immediate surgery was not required, she cunningly planned it to coincide with her wedding. Cuoco humorously adds that she knew she would have a ""babysitter"" in the form of her newlywed husband, Karl Cook.

Taking into account the length of the recovery process, which could extend up to six weeks, Cuoco mentions her intentions to keep a low profile during this period. Playfully panning the camera towards Cook, she exclaims that she is now confined to a sizable cast, and temporarily unable to engage in horse-related activities. Cuoco adds a jestful remark, hoping that they both survive the recovery process unscathed.

Cuoco initially unveiled news of her surgery on Thursday, alongside a selfie taken at the hospital. Expressing her gratitude for the support and love she has received, she anticipates that her husband, Cook, will provide entertaining updates throughout her recovery. True to her expectations, Cook promptly posts a photo of Cuoco during her hospital stay, humorously referring to her ""shoulder surgery honeymoon"" and emphasizing her unique post-operation glow.

And while it would be wholly reasonable for her to spend this next week in bed (or at least on a couch in sweatpants, maybe sequinned sweatpants) relaxing and eating carbs, in the day and a half since her victory, she's upped and moved to New York City and begun an already-intense round of media appearances. Heavy is the head that wears the crown, after all, even if Kára says that crown is actually super light. As her first in-depth interview, Kára spoke with Cosmopolitan.com on Tuesday morning. Read on for her take on the controversy surrounding her Q&A moments, both health care and ""equalism,"" as well as what she's most looking forward to now she's in NYC. OK, it's street food, but guess what kind?! So, you’re coming off just a kind of busy weekend, you know? How are you feeling this morning?! I'm well. I feel well-rested! I looked in the mirror this morning, and I was like, Whoa, I am Miss USA. And it just hit me [for the first time] like a ton of bricks. This entire experience has been so life-changing. And it’s just begun! I'm just so excited. I know there'll be tiring days coming up, but I'm really energized. I think the two bags of green tea that went in my cup this morning are really helping. What does the crown feel like? Oh my goodness. It feels like a halo. If I could really explain it, it’s like that halo Snapchat filter; just imagine that. It’s so light, and I just can’t even believe that I’ve been honored and graced with this opportunity to wear it. Courtesy of Miss USA During the live broadcast, was there a moment when you went from being “confidently beautiful” to, say, confident you could win? Well, I showed up to win! But really, I think [that moment] came when they called me for top three. I was the first one [called]. I remember standing on the little box that they had us positioned on, and I just lifted my head and asked God for guidance, and just let him know I was extremely thankful. I think that was like my turning point, like OK, Kára, you could really have this in the bag. You could take this all the way back to D.C. Last year’s Miss USA, Deshauna Barber, was also Miss District of Columbia. Was that something that ever psyched you out or made you second-guess your chances? Absolutely. There were like a lot of naysayers in my ear, saying, ""Ah, bad luck, states don't win back-to-back."" But I had to let them know Drake put that out there in the universe for us and [D.C.] came back strong. Deshauna is just such a phenomenal person and she really broke so many pageant stereotypes. I'm just so thankful to have her as a sister, a friend, and a mentor — and her crowing me is by far one of the most honorable achievements that I've had. In many respects, I think you’re also breaking some of those “pageant stereotypes” — your career in nuclear sciences, for example. How did you get into that line of work? I have a degree in chemistry [with a concentration] in radiochemistry from South Carolina State University, and I started my career at the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2013. My day-to-day job now involves nuclear licensing and regulations; the agency focuses on emergency preparedness for nuclear energy domestically. I can't even begin to tell you how much [my colleagues] have supported me. Initially I kept it a secret that I ran for Miss D.C. USA, but someone shared it on Facebook, and then the word got out, and there’s been a real outpouring [of love]. Everyone has been great. Will promoting the sciences be part of your Miss USA platform? Absolutely. [I run] a self-funded program called Science Exploration for Kids, which encourages students to find joy in the STEM subjects, as well as a career path. I run after-school programs and tutoring sessions and symposiums. It’s about any or all of the sciences, although I am biased; I love to see people major in chemistry — beca",0,en,0,"Kára McCullough, Miss District of Columbia, was crowned Miss USA 2017 during the sparkly pageant Sunday night in Las Vegas.

I think that was like my turning point, like OK, Kára, you could really have this in the bag. You could take this all the way back to D.C. Last year’s Miss USA, Deshauna Barber, was also Miss District of Columbia. Was that something that ever psyched you out or made you second-guess your chances? Absolutely. There were like a lot of naysayers in my ear, saying, ""Ah, bad luck, states don't win back-to-back."" But I had to let them know Drake put that out there in the universe for us and [D.C.] came back strong. Deshauna is just such a phenomenal person and she really broke so many pageant stereotypes. I'm just so thankful to have her as a sister, a friend, and a mentor — and her crowing me is by far one of the most honorable achievements that I've had. In many respects, I think you’re also breaking some of those “pageant stereotypes” — your career in nuclear sciences, for example. How did you get into that line of work? I have a degree in chemistry [with a concentration] in radiochemistry from South Carolina State University, and I started my career at the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2013. My day-to-day job now involves nuclear licensing and regulations; the agency focuses on emergency preparedness for nuclear energy domestically. I can't even begin to tell you how much [my colleagues] have supported me. Initially I kept it a secret that I ran for Miss D.C. USA, but someone shared it on Facebook, and then the word got out, and there’s been a real outpouring [of love]. Everyone has been great. Will promoting the sciences be part of your Miss USA platform? Absolutely. [I run] a self-funded program called Science Exploration for Kids, which encourages students to find joy in the STEM subjects, as well as a career path. I run after-school programs and tutoring sessions and symposiums. It’s about any or all of the sciences, although I am biased; I love to see people major in chemistry — because the numbers [in that field] are so low. I was actually the only person in my class to graduate with a degree in radiochemistry, and so every summer, I had a phenomenal internship and I got paid! That's why I always try to encourage students to find joy in science, because the opportunities are endless. And I love getting to see children having fun and enjoying their projects, and I just hope to expand their imagination through science. Do you have a go-to experiment to pique kids’ interest from the get-go? My favorite one I call an ""explosion of colors.” It’s about how soap reacts with, like, fatty acids, and what I do is take a plate, fill the plate up with milk, and then put food coloring— your favorite colors, of course— in the middle of the plate. Then I’ll take a Q-tip with some soaps [on it] and put it right smack down in the middle of the plate amid the food coloring, and you'll see how the soap interacts with the milk. Basically, [the chemical reaction happening] makes the colors just spiral everywhere. I have to confess I hated science in school but I do like pretty colors. I'm going to make you love it. You'll come over and we're going to do some projects together. What’s been the response from your friends and family since the big win? I literally have 500 text messages on my phone right now. It might have gone up to 600 actually — all my family and friends were saying, ""Kára you’ve always been someone who is chasing after their dreams and actually executing them,"" and they're like, ""You're encouraging people"

July 2015 -- The nanny scandal Us Weekly broke the story on July 29, claiming that Affleck had secretly been dating Ouzounian, and that the two frequently texted and emailed after she was let go as his children's nanny. Earlier that month, Ouzounian tipped off the paparazzi, telling them she'd be at the L.A.-area rental house that Affleck was staying in at the time, a source later told ET. The former nanny was seen smiling wide as she handed Affleck a bottle of champagne during their late-night meetup. She also arrived at Affleck's in his Lexus, which she had also been seen driving earlier in the day while running errands. Affleck's rep slammed the reports, telling ET that ""all allegations of a romantic relationship are baseless and untrue"" and that they are considering legal options. ""The story is complete garbage and full of lies,"" his rep stated. April 2017 -- Garner and Affleck officially file for divorce Affleck and Garner legally filed for divorce in April 2017, after a two-year separation. Still, the pair have made it clear that their three children -- Violet, Seraphina and Samuel -- remain their priority. Just one month earlier, Affleck thanked Garner for her support after announcing that he had just completed treatment for alcohol addiction. ""I'm lucky to have the love of my family and friends, including my co-parent, Jen, who has supported me and cared for our kids as I've done the work I set out to do,"" he wrote in his statement on Facebook. July 2017 -- Affleck steps out with Shookus Affleck was photographed with Shookus for the first time on July 6, when the two had dinner at Giorgio Baldi restaurant in Los Angeles.

They have kept their relationship very low key and private."" Another source also tells ET that much like Affleck and Garner, Shookus and her ex -- whom she married in 2010 -- are also ""extremely amicable."" ""They live separately but","Some reports suggest that Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus began their relationship while they were still married to their respective spouses. According to a source, Affleck first encountered Shookus when he was still married to Jennifer Garner and Shookus was married to Kevin Miller, a fellow producer on Saturday Night Live. The source reveals that Affleck and Shookus were seeing each other as early as late 2014, several months before news of Affleck's alleged fling with his children's nanny, Christine Ouzounian, broke in the summer of 2015. However, a source close to Affleck disputes these claims, asserting that the actor and Shookus did not become romantically involved until after his separation from Garner in 2015. It is important to note that both Affleck and Shookus were married at the time, but our sources suggest that they were discreet about their relationship and took precautions to keep it hidden. 

A timeline of their alleged relationship reveals that Affleck and Shookus reportedly started seeing each other in 2013, two years prior to Affleck and Garner's separation. One month after Affleck's monologue on a Saturday Night Live episode in May 2013, eyewitnesses apparently observed Affleck and Shookus looking flirty at The Heat premiere after-party in New York City. Over the years, their relationship supposedly continued, but it was not until 2015 that they became involved romantically, according to a source close to Affleck. This source claims that Affleck and Shookus had an affair, frequently meeting up in New York City and other locations. 

In 2015, Garner and Miller reportedly discovered Affleck and Shookus' alleged relationship at the same time. However, a source close to Affleck asserts that Shookus was not the cause of their marriage's end, claiming that they faced numerous other problems. Affleck and Garner officially announced their separation on June 30, 2015, emphasizing their commitment to co-parenting their children and requesting privacy. 

The nanny scandal involving Affleck and Ouzounian emerged in July 2015. Us Weekly reported that Affleck and Ouzounian were secretly dating, with frequent texting and emailing occurring even after Ouzounian was no longer employed as the children's nanny. Affleck's representative denied these allegations, calling them baseless and untrue. 

Affleck and Garner filed for divorce in April 2017 after two years of separation. They have consistently emphasized their children's well-being and continue to co-parent. In July 2017, Affleck and Shookus were photographed together for the first time, and sources suggest that their relationship is going well. Shookus, who has experience in the entertainment industry, understands the expectations and limitations of a relationship with someone in the public eye, which reportedly puts Affleck at ease. Both Affleck and Garner, as well as Shookus and her ex-husband from her previous marriage, are said to maintain amicable relationships despite their separations."

Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It’s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.”  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer “pinches me on the ass a lot.” A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer’s firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC’s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer’s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.

The movement inspired the new Time’s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time’s Up was a major focus at this year’s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  “I think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,” Couric tells PEOPLE about Time’s Up. “Clearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.”  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  “One of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,” she says. “I just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this.

Couric, 61, expresses her distress over the distressing and disorienting accounts she has come across regarding Lauer's actions towards women at the Today show, stating it is completely unacceptable. During her tenure and even after her departure, Couric claims to have had no knowledge of such behavior. She emphasizes that the Matt she knew was a kind and respectful colleague, contrary to the troubling allegations. Despite the turmoil, Couric admires the way Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb, and the entire Today show staff have handled this difficult situation. 

The late-night show joke Couric refers to occurred in 2012 on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, where she jokingly mentioned that Lauer would frequently pinch her on the backside. This comment resurfaced online following Lauer's firing. 

Having co-hosted NBC's Today show with Lauer for 15 years, Couric left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News. 

In November, Lauer was fired by NBC News due to a ""detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,"" with indications that this may not have been an isolated incident. Anonymous reports in Variety and The New York Times have also accused him of sexual harassment and assault. Lauer addressed the initial allegations in a statement, expressing deep sorrow and regret for the pain he has caused others. 

While this PEOPLE interview marks the first time Couric delves into the details surrounding Lauer's departure, she briefly acknowledged the scandal on social media in December, mentioning that it is incredibly upsetting and hinting that she will speak out when ready. 

The accusations against Lauer emerged alongside numerous others against powerful individuals in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey. This prompted the creation of the Time's Up initiative and legal defense fund, which aims to support victims of sexual misconduct in pursuing legal action against their perpetrators. The movement was prominent at this year's Golden Globes, where attendees wore black to raise awareness. Couric expresses her admiration for the solidarity amongst women and the demand for change in various industries, seeing it as a long overdue course correction. 

Furthermore, Couric shares that an episode in her upcoming Nat Geo documentary series will focus on workplace harassment experienced by women in Hollywood, Silicon Valley, and other sectors. She had recently interviewed Elisabeth Moss on the subject, highlighting that harassment represents just one facet of the challenges women face."

(Image: REX/Shutterstock)  (Image: Getty Images)  “But when you look at it, in a weird way, there are no accidents. “Life works out how it should and I made sure I did everything I could so that if I was sat here two years on, I know I tried everything I could as opposed to being steadfast or arrogant or assuming I didn’t need help or we didn’t need help.  “I kind of embraced the help.”  The couple have three sons with Gwen - Kingston, 11, Zuma, nine and Apollo, three.  (Image: NIJO)  Gavin is now dating German model Sophia Thomalla, 27, while Gwen is dating Blake Shelton, 41.  When asked whether he had told his children about his girlfriend, he said that they hadn't.  He revealed: ""Not yet no. [We’ve had] a bit of FaceTime to ease it in you know.”","Gwen Stefani dismisses rumors of her breakup with Blake Shelton in a recent Instagram post. The photo captures a tender moment between the couple, reaffirming the status of their relationship. Speculations about the breakup were fueled by claims of jealousy and drama surrounding Gwen's ex-husband, Gavin Rossdale. According to a source from In Touch Weekly, Gwen's alleged neediness and her fear of infidelity from her famous partner became a breaking point in their relationship. Blake apparently decided to continue his country tour without Gwen after a contentious argument, leaving her feeling upended. Mirror Online has reached out to Gwen's representative for any comments. Gavin recently revealed in an interview on Loose Women that he and Gwen had undergone extensive counseling in an attempt to salvage their marriage. However, after 13 years together, they finalized their divorce in 2016. Gavin expressed his belief that life ultimately unfolds as it should and acknowledged the importance of seeking help when needed. Gwen and Gavin have three sons together, while Gavin has moved on to a relationship with German model Sophia Thomalla. So far, Gavin hasn't introduced his children to his new girlfriend."

McEnroe suggested that if Williams were to compete against male players, she would struggle to place higher than 700th in the world rankings. However, Dmitry Tursunov, the current male player ranked 701st, expressed confidence in his ability to defeat her. In an interview with US radio station NPR, McEnroe clarified his remarks, emphasizing his respect and admiration for Williams while acknowledging the possibility of exceptional female talent surpassing their male counterparts in the future. Yet, he maintained that based on his observations across various sports, including tennis, he has not witnessed such a phenomenon. Williams later responded to McEnroe's comments on Twitter, politely requesting that he refrain from sharing unfounded opinions about her abilities and respect her privacy, particularly as she is currently focusing on starting a family. At the age of 35, Williams secured her 23rd Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January, unknowingly while pregnant. Tursunov, a former top 20 male player, remarked that he did not believe McEnroe intended to belittle women's tennis, but rather highlighted the physical advantage men generally possess. He expressed his belief that he could win against Williams in a hypothetical match, drawing a parallel to the debate over who would run faster, the fastest woman or the fastest man. Tursunov acknowledged that factors beyond physicality influence match outcomes and noted that despite his lower ranking, he considers himself a formidable opponent. Reflecting on the history of gender-based tennis matches, the famous ""Battle of the Sexes"" between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs in 1973 stands out. Riggs, a retired former world number one, believed he could defeat any top female player at the age of 55. Initially, King declined his challenge, leading Margaret Court, the number one female player, to step in, only to lose to Riggs. However, King later faced Riggs in an exhibition match and emerged victorious. Another notable match occurred in 1992 between tennis greats Jimmy Connors and Martina Navratilova, where Connors prevailed following adjusted rules to level the playing field."

Brothers, James Stanford Poore, 32, and Cedric Dwayne Poore, 39, were arrested and booked on four complaints each of first degree murder, Chief Chuck Jordan said.  On Monday, January 7, 2013, twin sisters Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Powell-Melchor, 23; Misty Nunley, 33, and Julie Jackson, 55 were found shot in the head, with their hands tied behind their backs inside a south Tulsa apartment, police say. A 3-year-old boy was also found inside the apartment, unharmed.  Chief Jordan said the murders were not gang-related. According to arrest reports, witnesses told investigators that the brothers left an apartment in the same building at Fairmont Terrace Apartments, near 61st and Peoria, saying they were going to pull a ""lick"" at the victims' apartment.  Witnesses told police the brothers returned about 20 minutes later with a bag full of drugs, cash, and jewelry. According to the report, James Poore told the witnesses that he shot one of the victims because she could identify him and that Cedric shot the other three. The witnesses told investigators the brothers split the money and that Cedric Poore took the jewelry to pawn.    When he was interviewed Wednesday, James Poore confirmed to investigators that he knew one of the victims and that he was in the apartment where the witnesses placed him. Before invoking his right to remain silent, he told investigators he knew one of the victims had used and sold illegal drugs and that Cedric drove a black van to the apartment the day of the murders.    The arrest report shows Cedric Poore denied being in the apartment the day of the murders and refused to speak to investigators any more.

Cedric Poore has been in Tulsa County jail on a traffic violation since January 14, and James Poore was arrested Wednesday morning.

Brothers James Stanford Poore, aged 32, and Cedric Dwayne Poore, aged 39, were apprehended and charged with four counts each of first-degree murder, according to Chief Chuck Jordan.

The victims, twin sisters Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Powell-Melchor (23 years old), Misty Nunley (33 years old), and Julie Jackson (55 years old), were tragically found with gunshot wounds to the head, their hands bound behind their backs inside a south Tulsa apartment. A three-year-old boy, who was also found in the apartment, was unharmed.

Chief Jordan stated that the motive behind these horrifying murders was not related to any gang activity. Information gathered from witnesses revealed that the suspects left their own apartment in the same building as Fairmont Terrace Apartments, situated near 61st and Peoria, with the intention of carrying out a criminal act at the victims' residence. Approximately 20 minutes later, the witnesses reported seeing the brothers return with a bag containing drugs, cash, and jewelry. One witness informed investigators that James Poore shared his motivation for shooting one of the victims, fearing she could recognize him, while Cedric Poore was responsible for shooting the other three victims. The witnesses further disclosed that the brothers divided the stolen money between them, with Cedric Poore pawning the stolen jewelry.

During the interview on Wednesday, James Poore admitted to investigators that he knew one of the victims and was present at the apartment complex at the time specified by the witnesses. He also provided the information that one of the victims had a history of using and selling illegal drugs, and described how Cedric had arrived at the apartment that day driving a black van. Shortly after making these statements, James Poore invoked his right to remain silent. In contrast, Cedric Poore denied being present in the apartment on the day of the murders and declined any further communication with investigators.

Chief Jordan revealed that both brothers were residents of Fairmont Terrace Apartments. However, the property manager confirmed that neither of them were on the lease agreement. Cedric Poore had been confined in Tulsa County jail since January 14 for a traffic violation, while James Poore was apprehended on Wednesday morning. Records from the Department of Corrections indicate that both brothers had been previously incarcerated for armed robbery.

Chief Jordan concluded the press conference by mentioning the possibility of additional arrests in connection with this case. Mayor Dewey Bartlett also released a statement in response to the news of the arrests, commending the Tulsa Police Department for their swift action. He expressed his unwavering faith in Chief Chuck Jordan and the entire police force, highlighting the importance of public assistance in solving such heinous crimes."

gossipcop-954445,"Karlie Kloss just announced she married Joshua Kushner on October 18 with a surprise wedding portrait on Instagram. The news arrives about three months after the model revealed she and and her longtime boyfriend became engaged.  The model has kept her relationship with Kushner fairly private since the pair began dating. While most people are aware of Kushner's famous White House connection, Kloss' husband is still a bit of an enigma. Here's everything you need to know about Joshua Kushner:  1. His brother is Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump's husband—but he doesn't share their politics.  Despite keeping a relatively low profile himself, Joshua's older brother, Jared, has been making a name for himself in the Trump administration as a senior advisor. However, Joshua doesn't share Jared's political views.  ""It is no secret that liberal values have guided my life and that I have supported political leaders that share similar values,"" the 33-year-old revealed in a 2017 Forbes interview. ""But neither political party has a monopoly on the truth or on constructive ideas for our country. It's important to be open minded and learn from differing opinions.""  Forbes also reported that the Democrat did not vote for Trump in the 2016 election. According to The Daily Mail, ""Josh and Jared’s parents were Democratic donors until 2016.""  It seems as though Joshua shares his wife's political views—Kloss was vocal about voting for Hillary Clinton. She regularly gets involved in political campaigns, with Joshua supporting her at political marches including March for Our Lives in 2018.  2. He's been dating Kloss since 2012.  According to Bustle, Kloss and Kushner first met in June 8, 2012, with the model revealing on the same date in 2016, ""Four years ago today I met my best friend. I love you more everyday.""  Rumors about their relationship initially started when Kushner attended a Victoria's Secret Fashion Show afterparty in November 2012, with Us Weekly reporting via a source that, ""They are really cute together. [Kushner] seemed nervous and shy around everyone but handled it well. Karlie is stunning and the sweetest girl ever. She stuck close to him.""  Of keeping her relationship private, Kloss told Porter in April 2018, ""I know in my life what really matters to me. I'm not trying to hide that from the world; I just really like having a more private, private life. I've got nothing to hide, though!""  The couple recently made a rare public appearance together at the 2018 Met Gala.  3. The Kushner family's net worth is estimated at $1.8 billion.  Forbes estimated in 2016 that the Kushners were worth $1.8 billion, with their main sources of income being real estate ($1.15 billion) and venture capital investments ($420 million). $240 million of that share comes from Oscar, a millennial-focused health insurance company Josh founded in 2012. However, CNBC reported in March that the start-up is now valued at $3.2 billion.  According to Celebrity Net Worth, Josh Kushner's net worth is $800 million, although the accuracy of that exact figure is unclear.  Kloss' new husband also co-founded investment firm Thrive Capital, which has ties to Instagram. He's also a graduate of Harvard Business School.  Of his business ventures, Kushner told Ariana Huffington in 2015, ""It's incredibly difficult to build a business... I think it's important to kind of ignore when people say good things about you especially in this industry... Just be incredibly focused.""  4. Kloss converted to Judaism for Kushner.  A source revealed to People that in June 2018, Kloss converted to Judaism, a step which Ivanka Trump also took before marrying Jared. It's clear that the Victoria's Secret model is extremely serious about her husband.  5. He's not into fashion.

We suppose the only non-family members who know the truth are those blubbering crew members then.","Regardless of any preconceived notions about Keeping Up With The Kardashians, the long-running and popular show delves into some deeply emotional storylines. Beyond the surface-level focus on technology, healthy eating, and colloquial language, there are truly moving moments to be found.

Consider Kim's account of the terrifying ordeal she experienced in Paris, or Khloe's concerns about her fertility. The dysfunctional relationship between Scott and Courtney is also undeniably unsettling. It seems that shedding a tear for the Kardashians is not an uncommon occurrence, as revealed in their celebratory cover story with the Hollywood Reporter. Kendall explained that even the crew members can't help but be moved to tears when one of the girls opens up.

The personal connection between the family and their crew is undeniable. Kendall acknowledges the intimate relationship they share, stating that when someone cries on the show, it often prompts tears from the camera operators and producers as well. Kim reinforces this sentiment, emphasizing that these crew members witness every detail of their lives. The crew size can vary, ranging from a single person with an iPhone to a team of 30 individuals, all diligently observing their every move.

Anyone present on set during Kendall's controversial Pepsi advertisement would have also been privy to her reaction amidst the criticism she faced. While the public has not been provided with evidence of how Kendall responded to the backlash (as she deleted all related content from her social media and never made an official statement), Kim sheds some light on the situation. According to Kim, Kendall never allowed herself to be shown crying on camera. Despite the inner turmoil she experienced, Kendall made a conscious decision to appear resilient in the media. Kim, however, believed that Kendall should have spoken up, viewing the situation as unjust.

Ultimately, it appears that the only individuals who truly know the extent of Kendall's emotions during that time are the crew members who witnessed it firsthand."

The comedian began the movement on Twitter in protest of Trump not appointing a Latino to his cabinet, which every president has done since 1988. Lopez encouraged his followers to change their avatar to a brown square in support.

One social media movement, sparked by comedian George Lopez, called for a #Brownout in protest of Trump's failure to appoint a Latino to his cabinet. This movement encourages individuals to change their avatar to a brown square, symbolizing solidarity and support for Latino representation. Chrissy Teigen, known for her criticism of Trump, drew attention for her comments on the prayer portion of the inauguration, referencing Trump's past controversial remarks. Shonda Rhimes, on the other hand, praised Hillary Clinton and highlighted a list of alternative activities to engage in during the inauguration. Singer Katy Perry announced her intentions to sleep in instead of watching the ceremony and expressed her participation in the Women's March on Washington the following day. Other celebrities, such as Patton Oswalt, Christie Brinkley, and Elizabeth Banks, also suggested alternative activities to occupy their time. Despite the variety of responses, it is clear that the inauguration has already sparked political activism and debate amongst public figures."

According to The Sun, Tess, a well-known blogger and chef, recently decided to end things with Harry due to lingering feelings for her previous partner. The reason for this decision was not taken lightly. 

An undisclosed source revealed, ""Harry and Tess have been unable to meet in person for several weeks as both are constantly on the move, traveling the world. Tess also came to realize that she still harbored emotions for her ex-partner, which she sincerely admitted to Harry, expressing regret for her romantic involvement with the singer.

Harry was reportedly taken with Tess almost immediately. ""Once Harry met Tess, there was an immediate spark between them,"" the source revealed. ""Their shared interests in unique fashion and culinary delights deepened their connection, and romance blossomed quickly.

As she gears up to compete against coaches Miley Cyrus, Adam Levine, and Blake Shelton in season 13, it appears that she is also engaged in a battle with the show's executives, who have expressed their disapproval of her using the platform to promote her own production company, JHud Productions.

Sources close to production have revealed that Hudson received a clear message from NBC's higher-ups, requesting that she cease using The Voice as a means to plug her company. However, instead of complying with this directive, Hudson retaliated by sharing an Instagram post that not only promoted her production company but also showcased her doing so while sitting in her judge's chair on The Voice.

While tensions continue to rise, it seems that Hudson has also faced challenges in her relationship with her fellow coaches. Reports indicate that there is an underlying tension between Hudson and Miley Cyrus, and rumors circulate that both Cyrus and Blake Shelton often engage in negative discussions about Hudson behind her back.

Despite these conflicts, it appears that Hudson knows where to draw the line. When the cameras aren't rolling, she keeps to herself, avoiding unnecessary confrontation. However, according to an insider, she has come to terms with the fact that her return to The Voice is unlikely.

Fibromyalgia, a chronic pain disorder, is characterized by widespread tenderness and pain throughout the body. While it is not curable, 10 million Americans, predominantly women, are affected by this lifelong condition, as reported by the National Fibromyalgia & Chronic Pain Association. 

The documentary aims to raise awareness and connect individuals who are dealing with fibromyalgia. Lady Gaga, who previously disclosed her struggles with chronic pain on social media, now explores the depths of this disease in ""Gaga: Five Foot Two"".

Even if you're the Pope.  The only time it can affect you, however, is when you hear about it.  Or, worse, if someone makes the unpleasant comment directly to you.  Which brings us, quite naturally, to Twitter.  Here's a place that's just too perfect for the nasty, uncontrolled insult.  You can hide behind your egg and toss Bons-Molotovs at anyone you choose.  Some people choose Kim Kardashian.  She's an easy target.  Her life seems effortless. She's painfully wealthy, with a TV show, branded products left and right and an appearance fee surely only rivaled by Hillary Clinton.  Hers is such a cushy life that she can listen to Kanye West any time she wants.  Small wonder, then, that a Twitter user called Kevin James offered a wry dig at her countenance.

You can reply aggressively. This is rarely worth it with a troll.  You can ignore it and even block the person who directed their bile your way.  You can wait for your own fans to descend upon this poor individual and shred him from tweet to tweet.  Or, you can be splendidly disarming.  This last path was the one taken by Kardashian.  No it's not you, I totally am! https://t.co/9ZxgPyVkko -- Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) January 22, 2018  Not everyone can pull this off with a straight face.  But here, Kardashian showed she understood the emotional essence of her interlocutor.  His biggest problem was surely that he isn't Kim Kardashian.  So she brought him onto her side with something so blessedly charming that it not only made her seem entirely self-aware -- rather than merely self-absorbed -- but also must have enticed a chuckle from Kevin James himself.

People are always saying unflattering things about you.  Even if you're the Pope.  The only time it can affect you, however, is when you hear about it.  Or, worse, if someone makes the unpleasant comment directly to you.  Which brings us, quite naturally, to Twitter.  Here's a place that's just too perfect for the nasty, uncontrolled insult.  You can hide behind your egg and toss Bons-Molotovs at anyone you choose.  Some people choose Kim Kardashian.  She's an easy target.  Her life seems effortless. She's painfully wealthy, with a TV show, branded products left and right and an appearance fee surely only rivaled by Hillary Clinton.  Hers is such a cushy life that she can listen to Kanye West any time she wants.  Small wonder, then, that a Twitter user called Kevin James offered a wry dig at her countenance.  Is it me, or is @KimKardashian Sooo Self-absorbed.. even when she's saying Nothing.. lol.. & I Like the Kardashians #KUWTK -- Kevin James (@kevinjames4good) January 22, 2018  If you've ever been attacked on Twitter, you have choices.  You can reply aggressively. This is rarely worth it with a troll.  You can ignore it and even block the person who directed their bile your way.  You can wait for your own fans to descend upon this poor individual and shred him from tweet to tweet.  Or, you can be splendidly disarming.  This last path was the one taken by Kardashian.  No it's not you, I totally am! https://t.co/9ZxgPyVkko -- Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) January 22, 2018  Not everyone can pull this off with a straight face.  But here, Kardashian showed she understood the emotional essence of her interlocutor.  His biggest problem was surely that he isn't Kim Kardashian.  So she brought him onto her side with something so blessedly charming that it not only made her seem entirely self-aware -- rather than merely self-absorbed -- but also must have enticed a chuckle from Kevin James himself.  Indeed, it incited James to respond with quite considered contrition.  @KimKardashian Listen: altho my tweet came across ""seemingly"" disrespectful, it was just a thought/tweet worthy reaction.. lol...

On most other days, we walk away from a tense situation and only then do we start kicking ourselves that we didn't react a different way.  Harnessing it surely takes practice. A lot of practice.  Something Kardashian has surely done.","Absurdly Driven, a column that approaches the business world with a discerning perspective and a lighthearted touch, delves into the subject of public criticism. In today's society, no one is exempt from receiving unflattering comments, not even esteemed figures like the Pope. The impact of such remarks, however, is solely determined by one's awareness of them or, worse yet, when confronted with unpleasant comments directly. This brings us to the realm of Twitter, a platform notorious for the uncontrolled dissemination of insults. From behind the guise of anonymity, users can launch verbal attacks on anyone they choose. Predictably, some individuals choose to target easy marks such as Kim Kardashian. Celebrities like her, seemingly leading effortlessly luxurious lives with their wealth, TV shows, and branded products, become prime recipients of malicious criticism. 

Recently, a Twitter user named Kevin James took a mild shot at Kardashian's persona, evoking the notion that she exudes self-absorption even without speaking. James humorously expressed his thoughts while simultaneously confessing his fondness for the Kardashian family. 

When faced with such attacks on Twitter, users have several choices in how to respond. Reacting aggressively to trolls rarely proves worth the effort. Ignoring and blocking those who spew negativity is an option, as is relying on one's fans to come to their defense. However, there is an alternative path – one that is disarmingly gracious. Kardashian, adeptly navigating this path, responded with a self-deprecating tweet that cleverly captured the emotional essence of her interlocutor's quip. By doing so, she portrayed herself as more self-aware than self-absorbed. Additionally, her response likely earned a laugh even from Kevin James himself. Appropriately, James reciprocated her disarming approach, expressing thoughtful contrition and appreciation for Kardashian's sense of humor.

Thus, rather than succumbing to the emotional strain that public criticism can bring, Kardashian transformed the situation into a lighthearted exchange, infusing it with one of life's greatest joys: laughter. This skill of turning tense situations into pleasant ones is a coveted trait that most of us aspire to possess. On the rare occasions when we achieve this feat, it brings us immense satisfaction. In other instances, we often reflect on encounters and wish we had responded differently. This ability to harness the power of humor and charm requires extensive practice, an art that Kardashian has undoubtedly mastered."
gossipcop-211703249,"His sweet escape. Blake Shelton credits Gwen Stefani for getting him back on his feet following his divorce from Miranda Lambert. The country superstar opened up about his romance with the No Doubt frontwoman in a new interview with Billboard magazine.  As previously reported, Shelton told Stefani that he was splitting from Lambert during a meeting with their Voice coworkers. The “Misery” singer, who was new to the team at the time, got emotional.  “I won’t forget that day. I looked over at Gwen — who I didn’t really know — and she had these huge tears in her eyes. I thought, ‘Wow, she feels super bad for me!’” Shelton recalled. “She didn’t tell me much, because we didn’t know each other at the time, but she said, ‘I’m going through something very similar to what you’re going through. I understand. And I hate it.’”  Stefani was dealing with her own breakup at the time with Gavin Rossdale. (As Us Weekly exclusively revealed, the Bush rocker was cheating on her with their children’s nanny, Mindy Mann.) They announced they were ending their 13-year marriage in August 2015, one month after Shelton and Lambert announced they were divorcing after four years.  The “Came Here to Forget” singer and Stefani leaned on each other for support during the difficult time. The closer they got, the more Shelton saw Stefani in a new light.  “That’s kind of how our friendship and bond started, that day. It went from that, to checking in on each other once a week through email — ‘This s–t happened to me, what happened to you?’ — to maybe three times a week, then every day, to ‘Hey, here’s my phone number if you ever want to text,’” Shelton told Billboard. “Next thing I know, I wake up and she’s all I care about, and I’m ­wondering if she feels the same about me.”  “Gwen saved my life,” he added. “Who else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician? You can’t even imagine the similarities in our divorces.”  The two teamed up professionally too. Shelton included their collaborative track, “Go Ahead and Break My Heart,” on his 12th studio album, If I’m Honest.  “When we recorded the vocals for some of these songs, I was only six months removed from when all the crap went down,” Shelton said of his split from Lambert. “When you have a broken heart — at least, when I do — you got to get it out of your system. You want people to sympathize with you. I was at rock bottom, in the middle of hell.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

Her journey commenced within the fashion industry and later transitioned into the field of journalism, fueled in part by her parents' encouragement. In 1970, Wintour commenced her career as an editorial assistant for the newly launched Harper's & Queen fashion magazine. Even at that nascent stage, her aspirations of editing Vogue were evident, eventually fulfilled almost two decades later.

Wintour, from her inaugural issue onwards, swiftly implemented significant transformations within the pages of Vogue. Notably, these modifications were apparent right on the magazine's cover. Departing from the magazine's previous preference for tightly framed headshots, Wintour favored a more naturalistic style of photography, showcasing lesser-known models in outdoor settings. Moreover, Wintour's debut Vogue cover shattered conventions as it featured a model clad in jeans, the first of its kind, accentuated by a lavishly adorned T-shirt valued at approximately $10,000.

Under Wintour's leadership, Vogue has remained a pivotal pillar within the realm of fashion journalism, maintaining its influential stance without wavering."

The case is now closed and the body is ready for pick up,” Ed Winter of the Los Angeles Coroner Office tells Us Weekly on Thursday, February 1.  As previously reported, the coroner confirmed to Us that the Glee alum died on Tuesday, January 30. Salling was found by a riverbed in the Sunland-Tujunga neighborhood of L.A., and was pronounced dead at the scene. Us confirmed that one of Salling’s family members reported him missing at 3 a.m. before his body was discovered on Tuesday.  The 35-year-old actor, who pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography involving a prepubescent minor in December 2017, was set to be sentenced on March 7. In October, he agreed to a plea deal that included four to seven years in jail. According to the court documents previously obtained by Us, Salling was also ordered to pay approximately $50,000 in restitution and register as a sex offender after his stint in jail.  However, a source close to his child pornography case explained to Us on Wednesday, January 31, that Salling’s estate might not have to pay his victims because he was not sentenced before his death.  “Restitution would be a part of his sentence. The amount of the restitution is determined by the sentencing judge … He will not be sentenced. Therefore there will be no restitution order,” the insider told Us. “Therefore I doubt that there is anything to take to civil court. Any restitution order would be allocated among multiple known victims.”  The source added, “I’m not saying that there isn’t some lawyer out there willing to file suit on behalf of someone claiming to be a victim. But I am saying, that there is no order to be enforced, for $50,000 or any other amount on behalf of anyone.”  Criminal defense attorney Troy Slaten, who is not directly involved in Salling’s case, further explained that Salling’s victims would have to file a suit in civil court to pursue any restitution.  “Any victims can sue his estate in civil court and receive monetary awards for damages. These awards … can be in the neighborhood of hundred of thousands of dollars or even in the millions,” Slaten said. They have to file suit in civil court, if they have not already, which they want to do quickly, because you do not want the estate to distribute assets.

Chmerkovskiy and Lachey will return Monday (8 p.m. ET) to the ballroom for Movie Night on the ABC reality dance competition.","Maksim Chmerkovskiy garnered attention when he opted out of taking part in Dancing with the Stars earlier this season, amidst rumors of a strained relationship with partner Vanessa Lachey. Social media platforms, particularly Twitter, have not allowed the dancing duo to escape the spotlight. Following their Snow White-themed performance on Disney Night this Monday, fans of the ABC reality dance competition began expressing their thoughts on the chemistry between the two. Some fans noted the palpable tension between Maks and Vanessa, even suggesting that it could be ""cut with a knife."" This sentiment, however, did not reflect the warm and affectionate dynamic observed between Chmerkovskiy, 37, and Lachey, 36, behind the scenes during the live show. During the commercial break before their performance, Lachey and Chmerkovskiy took the opportunity to interact with Lachey's two older children, who were seated in the front row. Chmerkovskiy then guided Lachey to the center of the ballroom to rehearse their routine. After rehearsing, Lachey returned to her children while Chmerkovskiy playfully joined her moments later, eliciting laughter from Lachey. Once the show resumed after the advertisements, they assumed their positions. Even after receiving their scores of 24 out of 30, fans continued to remark on their demeanor, perceiving it as uncomfortable. However, behind the scenes, Chmerkovskiy was seen comforting Lachey, who appeared to have hoped for higher scores. This gave credence to the rumors circulating about their strained relationship. Despite tension in the rehearsal room, sources divulged to PEOPLE that during Monday's emotionally charged elimination, Lachey sought solace in Chmerkovskiy's arms. This occurred when it was announced that her husband, Nick Lachey, was not in danger of being eliminated for the first time in three weeks. Chmerkovskiy embraced her and provided support until the entire cast came together to bid farewell to Gleb Savchenko and Sasha Pieterse. Chmerkovskiy and Lachey will return to the ballroom on Monday (8 p.m. ET) for Movie Night on the ABC reality dance competition."

It was written by David Benioff & D.B. Weiss and directed by Alan Taylor. Contents show] Plot Jon and the Brotherhood hunt the dead. Arya confronts Sansa. Tyrion thinks about the future. Summary At Winterfell At Winterfell, Arya Stark talks to her sister Sansa Stark about borrowing Bran Stark's bow and arrow. She tells Sansa that she practiced several times until she finally hit the bullseye. Arya recalls that their father Eddard Stark had been watching and clapped his hands in praise of her accomplishments. Arya reasons that their father knew that the rules were wrong but that his daughter was in the right. She then confronts Sansa about her alleged role in their father's death. Arya presents the letter that Sansa had written to their late brother Robb Stark urging him to come and bend the knee to King Joffrey Baratheon. Sansa replies that the Queen Mother Cersei Lannister forced her to do it under duress. Arya counters that she was not tortured and that she saw Sansa at Ned's execution; Sansa retorts that Arya did nothing to stop their father's execution either. Arya chastises Sansa for betraying their family but Sansa responds that they have only returned to Winterfell because of her, while Arya travelled the world in pursuit of her own agenda. Sansa adds that their half-brother Jon Snow was saved from defeat when Petyr Baelish and the Knights of the Vale came to their rescue and insists Arya would not have survived the torments she endured at the hands of Joffrey and Ramsay. Sansa demands to know where Arya found the letter and chides her younger sister that Cersei would be pleased to see them fighting but Arya is still bitter towards Sansa. She realizes that while Jon would understand the difficult circumstances Sansa was under when she wrote the letter, Sansa is afraid the Northern lords will discover it and turn on her, including Lyanna Mormont. Arya adds that Lyanna is younger than Sansa was when she wrote this letter but argues Lyanna wouldn't agree with Sansa's defense that she was a child at the time. While recognizing that Sansa wrote the letter out of fear, a bitter Arya says that she prefers to embrace anger over fear. Later, Sansa asks Petyr Baelish about where Arya got the letter from, unaware that Baelish orchestrated the entire incident. Sansa tells Petyr that she is commanding 20,000 men who answer to Jon but not to her. Petyr tells Sansa that the men will trust her because she can rule. Sansa does not trust the loyalty of the Northern lords, citing their history of switching sides. She counters that the discovery of the letter will turn her liege lords and men against her. Sansa confides in Petyr about her strained relations with Arya. Petyr suggests that Sansa talk to Brienne of Tarth because she has sworn to protect both of Lady Catelyn Stark's daughters from harm's way. Trusting Baelish, Sansa accepts his advice. The following morning, Maester Wolkan informs Sansa that they have received a letter from Queen Cersei. Sansa meets with Brienne, who advises her not to leave Winterfell. Instead, Sansa decides to send Brienne as her representative since she could reason with Jaime Lannister. Brienne warns that it is too dangerous for her to leave Sansa alone at Winterfell with Petyr. Sansa insists that her guards and men are loyal to her but Brienne warns that Petyr might be bribing them behind her back. Brienne offers to leave her squire Podrick Payne, whose swordsmanship has improved, but Sansa insists that she can take care of herself. Following the events of the Wight Hunt, Sansa enters Arya's quarters and opens a leather case containing several ""faces"", including the literally late Walder Frey's face.

Arya catches her sister pilfering through her personal effects. When Sansa tells Arya that her men are loyal to her, Arya mockingly retorts that they are not here. Arya tells Sansa that she obtained the faces from the Faceless Men of Braavos and admits she spent time training to be a Faceless Man. She forces Sansa to play the lying game and begins by asking if she thinks that Jon is the rightful King. Sansa demands that Arya tell her what the ""faces"" are. Arya replies that they always wanted to pretend to be other people. Sansa wanted to be a queen while Arya herself wanted to be a knight. In the end, neither of them got what they wanted. Arya says that the faces allow her to become someone else and toys with the idea of assuming Sansa's face and status. Arya approaches Sansa with her dagger and muses as the possibility of becoming the Lady of Winterfell. However, Arya relents and leaves a disturbed Sansa alone with the dagger. The Wight Hunt At Dragonstone castle, Queen Daenerys Targaryen and her Hand Tyrion Lannister chat in the Chamber of the Painted Table. Daenerys tells Tyrion that she appreciates the fact that he is not a hero because they have a tendency of risking their lives to do dangerous things. She compares Tyrion favorably to ""heroes"" such as Khal Drogo, Ser Jorah Mormont, Daario Naharis and Jon Snow, most of whom ""do stupid things, trying to outdo the others"". Tyrion, slightly amused, notes that all of those individuals fell in love with Daenerys, but she dismisses the obvious implication that Jon Snow is in love with her – to which Tyrion sarcastically quips that Jon must be staring so longingly at her because he is so eager for a military alliance. Daenerys remarks that Jon is too little for her tastes, but immediately apologizes when she realizes she's accidentally insulted Tyrion's height. Daenerys also recognizes that Tyrion is no coward.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. BERNARD SHAW, CNN ANCHOR: After three days of speeches, this Republican Convention and delegates prepare for the big one. JUDY WOODRUFF, CNN ANCHOR: Delegates are on their way to the convention hall anxious to hear what George W. Bush will say to them and to the rest of the country. ANNOUNCER: Tonight from Philadelphia, the 37th Republican National Convention; 2000 delegates, 10,000 volunteers, and 15,000 media members have converged on the cradle of American democracy for the nomination of the GOP candidates for president and vice president of the United States. In this grand old city, the Grand Old Party of Lincoln, Eisenhower and Reagan starts its quest for the White House, led by a man with Texas roots and a president's name. Now, from Philadelphia's First Union Center, here are CNN's Bernard Shaw, Judy Woodruff, and Jeff Greenfield. SHAW: And welcome to this grand finale night. Judy, Jeff, my mother used to say, it's not what you say, it's how you say it. WOODRUFF: That's right. We already actually have a few tips about what Governor George W. Bush is going to say tonight. His campaign put out a release already, which we can tell you, they say he's going to say, among other things: ""Times of plenty, like times of crisis, are tests of American character."" And Jeff, he will speak with regret about what has happened in the last eight years and say opportunities missed, time and again. JEFF GREENFIELD, CNN SENIOR ANALYST: Opportunities squandered, as Dick Cheney, said last night. You know, it is probably true that tonight -- and in two weeks at the Democratic Convention -- more Americans will spend more time listening to a sustained rhetorical argument than at any other time in the year. This is the one time an impatient political process slows down and lets a candidate for president talk to us. It is a very significant moment. WOODRUFF: And those people who perhaps have not been paying close attention to this campaign up until now will begin tonight to pay serious attention. GREENFIELD: This is when they tune in and say, I wonder if this guy is the guy I'll trust. It's a big one. WOODRUFF: As this convention has been going on, of course, we at CNN of course have been keeping a close watch on the story at a hospital here in Philadelphia -- former President Gerald Ford recovering from a stroke, minor stroke. Today, he had some visitors. Governor George W. Bush dropped by, met with some of the hospital staff. We also know that Bob Dole, who was the nominee at the Republican Convention four years, also came by to see the former president to pay his respects. And Jim Nicholson, who is the chairman of the Republican National Committee was there as well. GREENFIELD: But as we said, tonight is the tonight when George Bush gives his acceptance speech. We want to go down to the floor to get a sense of what the delegates might be thinking about, and certainly what our floor reporters are thinking about. And on the condition that you do not tell us that he has to be presidential, Jeanne Meserve, what's going on at this convention, and what's going to happen? JEANNE MESERVE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Jeff, of course George W. Bush will be defining his message tonight. But we've been hearing parts of it all week from the stage, but also from the floor. And it turns out there's a good reason why.

We have also been told that, in some delegations, there were heavy-handed attempts to persuade the McCain delegates to vote for Bush. Some resisted and only changed their minds after a personal appeal from Cindy McCain. Again, some delegates don't like it. One of them resents the orchestration, the effort to quash dissent. He said, at this convention, there is absolutely no meaningful role for a delegate to play. Now onto Candy Crowley. CANDY CROWLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: To say that this is an important night for George Bush understates the case. This is one really of three pivotal moments that in the past have either made or broken a presidential candidate: The selection of a vice president, the convention speech, and the fall debates are considered the three key moments for any campaign. So George Bush has been practicing this speech, has been rewriting this speech for weeks, even more than a month now. What Bush must do is play both to the people in this room; that is, mostly the more conservative members of this party, as well as reach out to those who will, in fact, decide the election, the swing voters. We are told this will be a subtler speech than Secretary Cheney's speech was last night; that, in fact, Bush will outline his agenda. He may take a poke or two at Al Gore about the Internet. But beyond that, what you are going to hear tonight is a direct appeal to the swing voters. George Bush is the key face in the new face of the Republican Party, and that is the face that we will see tonight. And now onto my colleague, Frank Sesno.

gossipcop-5866775064,"On the same day rumors spread that there’s trouble in paradise for Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani, another shocking report claims Miranda Lambert is desperately trying to meet up with her ex!  It’s been more than two years since Blake Shelton, 40, and Miranda Lambert, 33, ended their marriage, but she’s finally ready to sit down and hash things out, according to a new report. Amidst new rumors that Blake is having trouble in his relationship with Gwen Stefani, 47, an insider tells InTouch that Miranda wants to confront her ex to finally get closure. “It needs to be done,” the source tells the mag. “There’s still a lot of unfinished business between [Miranda] and Blake. She needs to look straight into Blake’s eyes, ask certain questions, and get answers.”  There are no plans set for this meeting to actually take place just yet, but the mag claims that if it does happen, Miranda plans to go in with a “clear head,” although that might not be so easy. “This could get heated,” the insider admits. “As soon as the emotions come up, [Miranda] may lose it.” This doesn’t mean the 33-year-old wants to get back together with her ex, though — actually, it’s just the opposite. She’s very happy with her man, Anderson East, 29, but feels a face-to-face with Blake is what she needs to fully be ready to commit to another relationship, according to the source.  “She feels that [she and Blake] have both grown so much since their divorce that meeting up is essential for them to have healthy relationships in the future,” InTouch’s insider says. “Who knows, maybe this meeting with Blake will have them walk away as friends. Either way, they’ll definitely be in a better place.”  As for the rumored trouble between Blake and Gwen, we’re going to take that report (from OK! magazine) with a grain of salt. After all, they were just spotted looking totally in love on Aug. 20! Plus, HollywoodLife.com has heard EXCLUSIVELY that they already have plans for a fun Labor Day together, so hopefully he’ll pop back up on her social media this weekend!  HollywoodLifers, do you think Blake and Miranda will meet up?",1,en,"On the same day rumors spread that there’s trouble in paradise for Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani, another shocking report claims Miranda Lambert is desperately trying to meet up with her ex!  It’s been more than two years since Blake Shelton, 40, and Miranda Lambert, 33, ended their marriage, but she’s finally ready to sit down and hash things out, according to a new report. Amidst new rumors that Blake is having trouble in his relationship with Gwen Stefani, 47, an insider tells InTouch that Miranda wants to confront her ex to finally get closure. “It needs to be done,” the source tells the mag. “There’s still a lot of unfinished business between [Miranda] and Blake. She needs to look straight into Blake’s eyes, ask certain questions, and get answers.”  There are no plans set for this meeting to actually take place just yet, but the mag claims that if it does happen, Miranda plans to go in with a “clear head,” although that might not be so easy. “This could get heated,” the insider admits. “As soon as the emotions come up, [Miranda] may lose it.” This doesn’t mean the 33-year-old wants to get back together with her ex, though — actually, it’s just the opposite. She’s very happy with her man, Anderson East, 29, but feels a face-to-face with Blake is what she needs to fully be ready to commit to another relationship, according to the source.  “She feels that [she and Blake] have both grown so much since their divorce that meeting up is essential for them to have healthy relationships in the future,” InTouch’s insider says. “Who knows, maybe this meeting with Blake will have them walk away as friends. Either way, they’ll definitely be in a better place.”  As for the rumored trouble between Blake and Gwen, we’re going to take that report (from OK! magazine) with a grain of salt. After all, they were just spotted looking totally in love on Aug. 20! Plus, HollywoodLife.com has heard EXCLUSIVELY that they already have plans for a fun Labor Day together, so hopefully he’ll pop back up on her social media this weekend!  HollywoodLifers, do you think Blake and Miranda will meet up?","According to recent reports, it seems that there may be some unresolved issues between Blake Shelton and his ex-wife, Miranda Lambert. Despite their divorce over two years ago, it appears that Miranda is now ready to have a sincere conversation with Blake and find closure. While rumors circulate about Blake facing difficulties in his current relationship with Gwen Stefani, an insider has shared with InTouch that Miranda is determined to confront her ex in order to gain clarity. The source explains, ""There are certain questions that need to be asked and answered, and it's time for them to address this unfinished business."" 

Although no specific plans have been made for this meeting, the magazine suggests that if it does happen, Miranda intends to approach the situation with a calm and collected mindset. However, the insider acknowledges that such an encounter may become emotionally charged, causing Miranda to potentially struggle with her composure. Despite this, it is important to note that Miranda has no intentions of rekindling any romantic relationship with Blake. In fact, quite the opposite is true: Miranda is currently in a happy relationship with Anderson East. The meeting with Blake is seen as a necessary step for her to fully commit to her current partner, as she believes that both she and Blake have grown significantly since their divorce. 

InTouch's insider further reveals, ""She feels that it is essential for them to meet in order to move forward and have healthy relationships in the future. Who knows, perhaps this meeting will allow them to part ways as friends. Either way, they will undoubtedly be in a better place after."" 

In regards to the alleged troubles between Blake and Gwen, it would be prudent to approach the OK! magazine report with skepticism. Recent photographs from August 20th show Blake and Gwen looking completely enamored with one another. Additionally, HollywoodLife.com has exclusively learned that the couple has plans for a delightful Labor Day outing together. It is safe to assume that Blake will reappear on Gwen's social media this weekend, indicating that all is well between the two. 

Do you believe that Blake and Miranda will indeed have this long-awaited meeting?"

According to an eyewitness who spotted them in LA, ""Corey was following Kris around while holding her handbag. It seemed as though she hardly acknowledged his presence."" 
Adding to Kris' disappointment, it is believed that Corey, previously associated with Justin Bieber as a road manager, initiated their separation. ""For a while now, she had been expressing her dissatisfaction with various issues, including his perceived lack of time spent together. Eventually, he reached a breaking point,"" disclosed a Star insider, noting Kris' devastation following the development.
Alone time appears to be an uncomfortable notion for Kris, as she strives to keep up appearances. Intriguingly, it is suspected that Kris and Corey had been projecting a united front in public for a considerable period, possibly due to declining ratings for their show, Keeping Up With The Kardashians. Kris is fervently determined to maintain the illusion of a harmonious existence."
gossipcop-4524134287,"No need to rush. Jennifer Lopez is not in a hurry to walk down the aisle with Alex Rodriguez, but she does want to spend the rest of her life with someone.  “I do believe in marriage,” the Shades of Blue actress, 48, told Harper’s Bazaar in a story published on Thursday, March 15. “And I would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship. But I’m not forcing anything right now.”  As far as her relationship with the 42-year-old former Yankees player, she said: “It’s good, it’s healthy; we communicate well. We understand each other’s lives in a way that most other people couldn’t.”  She added: “We both entered the public eye in our early twenties and overachieved right from the start. And that affects every dynamic in your life, from your family to your work to your relationships. We have a similar makeup.”  The pair celebrated their anniversary in February in Minneapolis, where the singer performed a concert ahead of the Super Bowl. During the show, she debuted her single “Us” written by Poo Bear and produced by Skrillex, and dedicated it to Rodriguez, who was in the audience. “We’ve been together for one year today. I don’t want to get all mushy or anything, but baby, this song’s for you. I love you,” she told the athlete while on stage.  When talking about how she chose the song, Lopez told the magazine that the lyrics fit right into where the couple were in their relationship. She said: “They played me about 20 different songs, and when I heard this one I was like, ‘Oh, this is relevant!’ Alex and I were just getting to know each other. And I was like, ‘Oh, my God, could this be? Could this be us?’”  Lopez was previously married to chef Ojani Noa for nearly a year in 1997, and dancer Cris Judd from 2001 to 2002. She later married singer Marc Anthony in 2004 and they called it quits in 2011. The pair share 10-year-old twins Max and Emme. The former Yankees shortstop shares daughters Ella, 9, and Natasha, 13, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis. They split in 2008 after six years of marriage.  A lot has changed in the “Dance Again” songstress’ life since her last relationship, and she said a lot of it has to do with really knowing herself. “When I was younger I spent a lot of time being half happy and half not happy,” she told the publication. “I know who I am and what I want. I also know my strengths and weaknesses. It took me a long time to get to a point where I could say something nice about myself. I’m glad I can do that now.”  Lopez remains optimistic as she continues with her career, raise her two children and make her relationship with Rodriguez work for the long run. “Baseball is just like life,” she said. “All you want to do is hit a home run.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!",1,en,"No need to rush.

gossipcop-5658990975,"Daniel Craig is returning as James Bond once again, even as he reportedly fights to save his marriage to Rachel Weisz at the same time. Craig has already announced his intent to return as 007 in the franchise’s 25th film, and according to the National Enquirer, he’s still struggling to salvage what’s left of his marriage.  The Enquirer’s source claimed at the beginning of 2017, “Rachel and Daniel haven’t been happy for a while, and nearly called it quits last year.” The report claims that the married couple was in two separate filming locations at the beginning of the year, but continued to stay apart even after wrapping their respective films. The Enquirer then claims that they finally reunited in July after not being seen together in ‘554 days’.  According to the sources, the minute the outlet attempted to lock down an exclusive on the couple’s rocky marriage, both Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig were seen arriving at New York’s Public Theater the next day, prompting the source to add, “The whole thing just seemed like too much of a coincidence. I don’t buy it for a minute.”  When you consider Daniel Craig’s own words, especially in the context of allegedly turning down a $150 million payday to star in two more James Bond films, he had stated, “Being on your own would be sad, sick, and weird. I don’t trust myself. I need that balance.” If these reports are to be believed, then Daniel Craig previously turned down starring in more Bond films to spend time with his family, but now – all of a sudden – he’s back to working on James Bond?  Either the report was never accurate to begin with, or he’s giving up on his marriage to Rachel Weisz. One would hope that the two have worked out whatever was troubling them in the first place, but given their own relationship and marriage histories – and how they’ve both jumped ship on long-term relationships at the drop of a hat – one wouldn’t be faulted for assuming that they are on their way to getting a divorce.  What do you guys think? Are Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz having marriage troubles, and is Daniel’s decision to take on the role of 007 again an indication that he’s giving up on his marriage? Or just a chance to have more career stability and/or cash in on a major paycheck? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images for Sony Pictures","Daniel Craig is set to reprise his role as James Bond in the franchise's 25th film, while simultaneously addressing rumors surrounding his marriage to Rachel Weisz. Despite their reported struggles, Craig has made it clear that he intends to return as 007. According to a source cited by the National Enquirer, there have been ongoing issues in the couple's relationship, prompting speculation about the future of their union. The source claims that at the beginning of 2017, Weisz and Craig's relationship was strained, nearly leading to a breakup. They were then separated due to work commitments, with the Enquirer noting that they hadn't been seen together for a span of '554 days'. However, the source questions the timing of these reports, as Weisz and Craig were seen together shortly after the Enquirer started trying to uncover details about their marriage. This has led to skepticism regarding the validity of these claims. It is worth considering Craig's own words on the topic, particularly in light of his alleged decision to turn down a $150 million offer to star in two more James Bond movies. He has previously stated his reliance on the balance that comes with being in a committed relationship, expressing his aversion to the idea of being on his own. Thus, if these reports are accurate, Craig's sudden commitment to another Bond film raises questions about the state of his marriage. It is hopeful that they have resolved their issues, but given their respective histories with relationships and marriages, one could speculate that divorce may be imminent. Ultimately, the decision to take on the role of James Bond again could be interpreted as either an indication of Craig's disinterest in his marriage or as an opportunity for increased career stability and financial gain. We invite you to share your thoughts on this matter in the comments below."

gossipcop-4774142356,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.

There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T","Katie Holmes, known for her role in the hit show ""Dawson's Creek"", has been rumored to be facing relationship struggles with her boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise, and their daughter Suri. According to a report from RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were supposedly planning a grand wedding worth $300,000, with Suri acting as the bridesmaid. This union was seen as a way to solidify their relationship, which had been kept mostly hidden for the past five years. However, it seems that the 39-year-old actress and single mother recently discovered that Foxx, a 50-year-old Oscar-winning actor, was not willing to give up his flirtatious tendencies, including maintaining a friendly relationship with his ex-girlfriend and mother of his 8-year-old daughter, Kristin Grannis. RadarOnline alleges that Foxx even brought Grannis as his date to Leonardo DiCaprio's birthday party in November. Realizing that her partner was not ready to commit, Holmes decided to call off the wedding and quietly break up with Foxx.

According to a source quoted by RadarOnline, Holmes became aware of Foxx's lack of respect towards her when he refused to sign a prenuptial agreement that included a no-cheating clause. This behavior caused Holmes to question the health of their relationship and the impact it would have on herself and her daughter Suri. Holmes felt the need to protect both of them. In addition to this ordeal, Holmes has also reportedly been dealing with her ex-husband Tom Cruise's attempts to reconnect with their daughter. Hollywood Life references a report from Star magazine, stating that Cruise regrets not being a present father for the past five years due to pressure from his Church of Scientology. The report suggests that Cruise is eager to become an active part of Suri's life once again.

The Star also claims that Holmes agreed to remain silent about Cruise and Scientology if he promised to stay away from their daughter and not engage in any attempts to influence her involvement with the controversial religious organization. Nevertheless, Holmes finds herself torn between her desire to protect Suri and her possible willingness to consider a reunion between Cruise and their daughter. According to an insider quoted by the Star, Holmes is slowly warming up to this possibility because she believes that Suri misses her father. She is cautiously considering this reconciliation while taking steps to ensure that Cruise does not bring his religious beliefs into their relationship.

Representatives for Holmes have denied both the breakup rumor about her and Foxx, as well as the report about a possible reunion between Cruise and Suri. Notably, Holmes' publicist, Leslie Sloane, has come forward to debunk the rumors, attaching her name to her statement. This marks the first on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx about the existence of their relationship, as they had gone to great lengths to keep it secret since reportedly starting dating in 2013. This secrecy was likely due to Holmes' divorce settlement from Cruise, which allegedly prohibited her from publicly dating for five years post-breakup. In September 2017, reports emerged suggesting that Holmes and Foxx had deliberately been photographed together on a Malibu beach, signaling the expiration of the five-year public dating ban.

Despite these denial statements, it is evident that the situation is complex and full of varying perspectives. The emotions and considerations involved in Holmes' relationships with Foxx and Cruise, as well as her role as a mother to Suri, are weighty and require careful handling."

According to Ninaki, Meghan's desire for fame outweighed her commitment to her former husband, film producer Trevor Engelson. This revelation contradicts the previous belief that Meghan and Trevor grew apart due to the physical distance between them, with Meghan filming in Canada and Trevor residing in Los Angeles.

Ninaki revealed, ""The way she handled it, Trevor definitely had the rug pulled out from under him. He was hurt."" While Trevor experienced heartbreak, Meghan seemed to be less affected by the separation. Prior to their split, Ninaki, who served as the maid of honour at their wedding, witnessed a strong and affectionate bond between the couple. She stated, ""Then, after the wedding, it was like a light switched off. There’s Meghan before fame and Meghan after fame. After three seasons of Suits, she called me to say the marriage was over.""

Meghan and Ninaki met at a young age, attending Hollywood's private Little Red School House together. Their friendship deepened when they both enrolled at the Immaculate Heart girls’ high school in Los Angeles at the age of 11. However, as time went on, they eventually fell out over the way Meghan and her ex-husband, whom she met at the age of 23, ended their relationship. Ninaki explains that she visited a heartbroken Trevor after their split, while Meghan appeared less affected.

Ninaki also shares that Meghan harbored aspirations of fame. ""She just loved to be the centre of attention,"" Ninaki said. ""We used to imagine her receiving an Oscar. She used to practise announcing herself."" Additionally, Meghan's interest in the Royal Family was evident to Ninaki, despite Meghan claiming to have known little about Prince Harry when they first met. ""I think it’s a very fanciful dream to believe that you just walk into a Prince Charming. I know the Royal Family was something she found fascinating,"" Ninaki explained.

In conclusion, Ninaki's insights provide a deeper understanding of the factors that led to Meghan Markle's first marriage ending and shed light on her aspirations for fame and interest in the Royal Family."

But for Victoria Adams, then known as Posh Spice, it turned out to be a key moment in her personal life too.  The video would soon catch the eye of Premier League soccer player David Beckham, who immediately picked out the brunette Spice Girl in her black PVC catsuit and matching gloves.  He declared: “That’s the girl for me and I'm going to get her! She's my idea of perfection. I knew that if she wanted me, we would be together forever.”  They later met at a Manchester United soccer players’ lounge, where it was love at first sight—although Victoria later admitted she was a little tipsy at the time.  The couple married in 1999 and had four children; sons Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz, and Harper. The pair have also forged a successful brand over their almost 20-year marriage, with Victoria starting a successful fashion label after attempting a less-than-stellar solo music career.  However, it hasn’t all been so rosy. The couple have endured a number of accusations of infidelity on David’s behalf, including from his former personal assistant Rebecca Loos in 2004.  The couple’s former nanny, Abbie Gibson, came forward in 2005 to stay their marriage was a sham, a claim hotly disputed by the Beckhams.

It was within this visual masterpiece that Premier League soccer player David Beckham was captivated by the dark-haired Spice Girl, donning a black PVC catsuit and matching gloves. Beckham confidently proclaimed, ""She is the one for me, and I will make her mine. She epitomizes perfection. I had an unshakable belief that if she desired me, our union would be eternal.""

David has been burdened with multiple allegations of infidelity, notably in 2004 when his former personal assistant, Rebecca Loos, came forward.

gossipcop-920346,"Craig Mack, the rapper who had the first hit on P. Diddy’s iconic hip-hop label Bad Boy Records, died on Monday. He was 47.  According to the New York Daily News, the rapper died of heart failure at his Walterboro, South Carolina home. His death was confirmed by Mack’s former producer Alvin Toney.  “Craig Mack, you were the first artist to release music on Bad Boy and gave us our first hit,” Sean “Diddy” Combs tells Rolling Stone in a statement. “You always followed your heart and you had an energy that was out of this world. You believed in me and you believed in Bad Boy. I will never forget what you did for hip-hop. You inspired me, and I will continue to try to keep inspiring others. We will always love you.”  Mack is best known for the indelible classic “Flava in Ya Ear,” – a Top 10 hit in 1994 that sold over a million copies – and its subsequent remix featuring Notorious B.I.G, LL Cool J, Busta Rhymes and Rampage. The original would eventually reach No. 1 on the Billboard rap songs chart and No. 9 on the Hot 100 and earn a Best Rap Solo Performance Grammy nomination. “Craig is hip-hop’s George Clinton, because his stuff is really off the wall,” Diddy once told The New York Times. “He does what’s from his heart, which is where it starts for him. But his energy comes from somewhere else.”  Mack, born in the Bronx in 1970, helped make Bad Boy Records synonymous with New York hip-hop, kickstarting the label that would eventually make stars of Notorious B.I.G., Mase, 112 and more. In a 1995 profile in The New York Times, Mack said he was hooked on rap by his cousins at age nine and began to write his own lyrics at age 12. “I knew I wanted to be like LL Cool J and Run-D.M.C.,” Mack recalled.  He became friendly with members of another famous New York rap group, EPMD, and accompanied them on tour. He did odd jobs for the group and did not perform, but Mack still remembered the experience as a valuable one. “All the time I was getting an education learning about the studio and the road,” he explained.  Mack first started rhyming in the late 1980s. Under the name MC EZ, listed alongside DJ Troup, he released a single 12-inch on Fresh Records in 1988: “Just Rhymin'” b/w “Get Retarded.” The nimble B-side would become a fave among rap fans and was interpolated by Dr. Dre and LL Cool J for the single “Zoom.” Mack eventually met Diddy – who was at that time looking to set up Bad Boy after being fired from Uptown Records – outside the club Mecca in Manhattan. Mack freestyled for Diddy and earned a record contract.  After breaking through with “Flava in Ya Ear” and its accompanying gold-certified album Project: Funk Da World, Mack struggled to replicate his initial success. He left Bad Boy Records and released Operation: Get Down in 1997 but did not score a hit from the album. Mack later appeared in the video for Diddy’s hit “I Need a Girl Part 1,” but his solo career never regained momentum.  Mack eventually became a minister in South Carolina and appeared to renounce his former life as a rapper in a 2012 video. The video, taken at the Overcomer Ministry commune in Walterboro, S.C., shows the group’s pastor Ralph Gordon Stair talking to Mack. “Craig Mack is dead,” Stair tells the congregation. “We have somebody that used to be Craig Mack.”  In Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop: The Bad Boy Story, the 2017 documentary chronicling the rise of Combs’ revered label and reunion tour, Mack can be heard discussing the possibility of returning to the stage, but declined because of his religious beliefs.  “I don’t think anybody was disappointed,” Combs told Billboard last year. “We kind of respected his wishes. In this game, man, people don’t realize the music industry only has a one percent rate ratio, so sometimes it’s very stressful and it brings you only to places that you can go to and should go to, which is God. We can respect that because if any of us is still here, we’d have to go to him, too.

He became friendly with members of another famous New York rap group, EPMD, and accompanied them on tour. He did odd jobs for the group and did not perform, but Mack still remembered the experience as a valuable one. “All the time I was getting an education learning about the studio and the road,” he explained.  Mack first started rhyming in the late 1980s. Under the name MC EZ, listed alongside DJ Troup, he released a single 12-inch on Fresh Records in 1988: “Just Rhymin'” b/w “Get Retarded.” The nimble B-side would become a fave among rap fans and was interpolated by Dr. Dre and LL Cool J for the single “Zoom.” Mack eventually met Diddy – who was at that time looking to set up Bad Boy after being fired from Uptown Records – outside the club Mecca in Manhattan. Mack freestyled for Diddy and earned a record contract.  After breaking through with “Flava in Ya Ear” and its accompanying gold-certified album Project: Funk Da World, Mack struggled to replicate his initial success. He left Bad Boy Records and released Operation: Get Down in 1997 but did not score a hit from the album. Mack later appeared in the video for Diddy’s hit “I Need a Girl Part 1,” but his solo career never regained momentum.  Mack eventually became a minister in South Carolina and appeared to renounce his former life as a rapper in a 2012 video. The video, taken at the Overcomer Ministry commune in Walterboro, S.C., shows the group’s pastor Ralph Gordon Stair talking to Mack. “Craig Mack is dead,” Stair tells the congregation. “We have somebody that used to be Craig Mack.”  In Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop: The Bad Boy Story, the 2017 documentary chronicling the rise of Combs’ revered label and reunion tour, Mack can be heard discussing the possibility of returning to the stage, but declined because of his religious beliefs.  “I don’t think anybody was disappointed,” Combs told Billboard last year. “We kind of respected his wishes. In this game, man, people don’t realize the music industry only has a one percent rate ratio, so sometimes it’s very stressful and it brings you only to places that you can go to and should go to, which is God. We can respect that because if any of us is still here, we’d have to go to him, too. Sometimes, people can’t walk back and forth in both wor"

gossipcop-1551062653,"  George Clooney and his wife, Amal, attend the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. (Alberto Pizzoli/AFP via Getty Images)  Once the ultimate bachelor — and two-time People’s Sexiest Man Alive cover model — George Clooney entered entirely new territory this week.  The Oscar-winning actor and his human-rights-lawyer wife of two years, Amal, announced Tuesday that they are the proud new parents of twins, Ella and Alexander.  Clooney has donned many hats in his life — actor, director, producer and activist, but fatherhood had always seemed far away. Was it the early-onset-salt-and-pepper hair? The coterie of models who found themselves on his arm for fleeting moments over the years? The insistence by tabloids and fellow co-stars that it was time for him to settle down? Maybe. Or perhaps it was the simple fact that Clooney himself said again and again that he would not reproduce. In several interviews. Many, many times. For many, many years.  A first-time father at 56, Clooney was often asked throughout his career whether the single life was his ultimate future. But after proposing marriage to Amal in April 2014 and marrying her that September (as well as sharing wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain), it seemed as if anything was possible for the man who once said, “I don’t see myself ever having kids.”  But it was a long road to get there. “I don’t have that gene that people have to replicate,” he told People in 2006.  When Esquire asked him why he wasn’t married with kids, he replied, “I haven’t had aspirations in that way, ever.” And as for people who thought it was weird that a man in his 50s was single and childless? “What do you do? Should I go, ‘I got to get me some kids right now!’ and rush out and impregnate someone?”  Clooney seemed to express frustration when asked how he could ever relate to the fathers he occasionally portrays onscreen. His answer: “Well, I’m also not running for president, but I played that role in ‘Ides of March.’ I wasn’t an actual lawyer when I did ‘Michael Clayton,’ and I don’t fire people for a living like I did in ‘Up in the Air.’ ”  “I keep saying I’ll never get married again or have children but people just don’t want to believe me,” Clooney told Britain’s Daily Express just three months before popping the question to his now-wife.  Of course, celebrities are people, too, and it shouldn’t surprise anyone that a man might change his mind around the midcentury mark. And Clooney is certainly not alone in choosing to wait till later in life to welcome a child into the family: Comedian Steve Martin became a father at age 67 in 2012; Elton John was 63 when he had a baby via a surrogate in 2010; and Chris Noth was 53 when he welcomed his only child in 2008.  Perhaps it’s the fact that Clooney always seemed so delightfully and devilishly Clooney-ish that made his bachelordom seem like the only constant in our ever-changing popular culture. But we can rest easy knowing that despite some hesitation about having a family over the years, his sense of humor has remained steady throughout.  “Ella, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine,” the statement announcing the birth of the twins read. “George is sedated and should recover in a few days.”",1,en,"  George Clooney and his wife, Amal, attend the 2016 Cannes Film Festival.

Previously embraced as the ultimate bachelor, adorned twice on the cover of People's Sexiest Man Alive, Clooney now embarks on a transformative journey. Delighting their supporters on Tuesday, the couple proudly shared their status as new parents, joyfully welcoming their twins, Ella and Alexander. Throughout his versatile career as an actor, director, producer, and activist, Clooney had seemingly distanced himself from the concept of fatherhood. Could it have been his graying hair, the fleeting presence of models on his arm, or the persistent suggestions of settling down from tabloids and co-stars? Conceivably. Alternatively, it could be attributed to Clooney's consistent declarations, repeated numerous times in countless interviews over many years, stating his disinterest in having children. Consequently, the 56-year-old first-time father contended with frequent questioning about his future as a bachelor. However, everything changed in April 2014 when he proposed to Amal, culminating in a September wedding. The couple even shared their wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain, thereby offering a glimpse into their newfound happiness. As Clooney himself once declared, ""I don’t see myself ever having kids."" Yet, the path to parenthood was undeniably extensive. ""I don’t have that gene that people have to replicate,"" Clooney shared candidly with People in 2006. When Esquire inquired about his unmarried and childless status, Clooney responded with a lack of aspiration. He mused, ""I haven’t had aspirations in that way, ever."" Regarding skepticism surrounding his lifestyle as a single man without children in his 50s, Clooney facetiously questioned whether he should abruptly change course and seek fatherhood in haste. Reflecting on his ability to connect with his onscreen portrayals of fathers, Clooney challenged the notion. He likened the situation to his roles as a president in ""Ides of March,"" a lawyer in ""Michael Clayton,"" or a professional ""firer"" in ""Up in the Air,"" stating that his acting prowess extended beyond personal experience. Clooney jokingly expressed his exasperation, affirming his stance on marriage and children just three months before proposing to Amal in an interview with Britain's Daily Express. Dismissing any surprise, Clooney joins a lineage of celebrities who chose to embrace fatherhood later in life. Entertainer Steve Martin welcomed his child at the age of 67 in 2012, Elton John became a father at 63 through surrogacy in 2010, and Chris Noth embraced fatherhood at 53 in 2008. While Clooney's persona has always been marked by delightful and devilish charm, his decision to become a parent showcases the evolving nature of our ever-changing popular culture. In the statement announcing the birth of his twins, Clooney's humor remained intact as he assured everyone of their health and happiness. He joked that he would require some time to recover while providing his assurance that he was sedated and would soon be back on his feet."

gossipcop-894910,"During the band’s Tuesday appearance on CBS’ 'The Late Late Show,' Corden made an amusing attempt to become the band’s new member.  The Backstreet Boys might have found a new member in James Corden — or so he hopes — as the late-night host performed alongside the boy band for a revamped version of their hit single during Tuesday night’s Late Late Show.  Jokingly promoting their new boy band, dubbed “James Street,” group members Nick Carter, Howie Dorough, AJ McLean, Kevin Richardson and Brian Littrell performed an mock version of their 1999 single, “Larger Than Life,” changing it to “Late Late-r Than Life” to reflect Corden’s 12:37 p.m. broadcast.  Prior to their sketch, the band teased their appearance with their mock album cover with Corden on Twitter, where they created the hashtag ""#Jamesstreet.""  In the performance, the late-night host and singers donned their signature white attire, recognizable from their 1999 album, Millennium, which featured the “Larger Than Life” single.  The sketch opened with Corden explaining that he plans to take over for one of the Backstreet Boys at their performance later that night. ""Corden's back, alright,"" he sang to the bandmembers as he stated his plan.  While Kevin Richardson explained to Corden that no one was going to opt out of the performance, the late-night host responded, ""How hard is it? What is being a Backstreet Boy? It's wearing a fedora and dancing on some tarmac. I think I got it.""  Following Brian Littrell's insistence that Corden could not handle the costume changes, Corden let the members vote on whom he replaces. Corden then decided that he should take Littrell's place onstage. ""Show me the meaning of being lonely,"" Corden said, referencing another song off the album, as Littrell exited the dressing room.  Following Littrell's forced departure, Corden tried to learn the choreography for the performance. He also took the liberty of suggesting new dance moves. When asked when he should do the worm, Howie Dorough responded, ""Maybe after the show.""  Despite resistance from the bandmembers, Corden eventually took on the role of choreographer and incorporated a number of new dance moves, including the band lifting him up during ""Larger Than Life."" When they perfected the lift, Corden instructed, ""And then you guys disappear 'til the end of the song.""  Not only did Corden take over for the performance, but he also attended the band's meet and greet. When taking a group photo with a fan, Corden flipped the iPhone camera and instead took a selfie. He then blocked a fan in another photo.  Corden led a prayer circle before he and the Backstreet Boys took the stage. ""Dear Lord, heavenly Jesus. I know what you're thinking. What's Brian doing there? We're thinking the same,"" he said. ""Make us strong. Show us the meaning of being lonely. Quit playing games with out hearts. Give us the call and know that everybody."" After a moment of silence, he added, ""I can't think of any other Backstreet Boys songs. We want it that way. We want it that way!""  The sketch then cut to the performance, in which a photo of Littrell onstage was been replaced with one of Corden. The band then appeared and began to sing ""Larger Than Life"" while the musicians are suspended on platforms in the air. Littrell eventually joined the group onstage. Corden then ran to the front of the stage and showed off his best dance moves, including the running man and the worm, as the band sang behind him.  The performance concluded when Corden thanked fans for coming and told them to drive home safe. Richardson then explained that they had 22 more songs to perform. ""I quit the band,"" Corden responded before walking offstage.

gossipcop-860217,"A CONTROVERSIAL reality TV star has courted controversy after admitting that she used drugs while pregnant with her daughter less than a year after admitting she nearly died of a heroin overdose.  Jenelle Evans’ past has been notoriously sketchy but the MTV Teen Mom 2 star says that despite the fact she has gotten her life back on track and that she’s “not a bad kid any more”, online speculation over her parenting methods is forcing Child Protection Services on her.  It comes after fans accused the star of child abuse after her son, Kaiser, begged for food on the TV show. The shocking footage sparked a Twitter backlash with the hashtag #SaveKaiser and cost the mother-of-three her job as an ambassador with Blue Apron.  In her memoir, Read Between the Lines: From the Diary of a Teenage Mom, Ms Evans admitted that at the peak of her drug addiction she was using heroin “four or five times a day”.  “I was hooked,” she said of her abusive relationship, which saw her arrested for possession of marijuana and heroin, according to Radar.  This week, Ms Evans appeared on The Brand podcast and admitted that while she was pregnant with daughter Ensley, she tested positive for THC, the principal psychoactive found in cannabis.  “I’m not going to lie about that. I tested positive for THC,” the reality star, 26, said.  Daughter Ensley did not test positive.  Ms Evans said the chemical compound was found shortly after she had given birth to her daughter just over one year ago after Child Protective Services asked her if she had smoked during her pregnancy.  “I said, ‘I did within the past 30 days,’” she explained.  “I said, ‘I have really bad esophageal spasms and I throw up every five minutes. I can’t eat.’ And they said, ‘OK, some mums do that. We are not here to judge. We are writing down your information.’”  She said that when Child Protective Services arrived for the wellness check, they closed the case soon after.  But then Ms Evans blamed online speculation over her parenting for at least 30 more visits from Child Protection, calling out “haters online saying that I abuse my kids”.  Despite promising she’s not using, viewers on the hit reality show, on which Ms Evans has appeared since 2011, aren’t so sure.  All jokes aside, someone should go to the land and make sure that those kids (more so Kaiser) are in a safe situation.

Or I’d be losing a lot of weight,” Ms Evans said.  But the young mum, who already has two children, sons Jace, 8, and Kaiser, 3 has a sketchy history with drug abuse, including a near-fatal heroin overdose in 2012.  “I was afraid to speak out and tell people that I was on drugs,” she told Us Weekly last year,  “I basically blacked out and woke up not remembering anything.  “I really was so close to dying.”  After her overdose Ms Evans described how she withdrew from the drug, describing it as “worst flu I’ve ever had for seven days”.  But by that stage the drug had already taken its toll; she had lost custody of son Jace and was “disowned” by family and friends.  “It hurt my heart, made me sick to my soul that I couldn’t see my son. I filled that hateful void with more drugs,” she wrote in her memoir.  “The drugs always made the pain go away. They didn’t turn on me or betray me.

The streaming giant has handed out a 10-episode, straight-to-series order for vampire drama V-Wars, based on the IDW novel of the same name, with the Vampire Diaries alum set to star. The order comes as another IDW property, the beloved Locke and Key, is awaiting word on a new home after Hulu's surprising pass on the pilot.  V-Wars revolves around Dr. Luther Swann (Somerhalder), who enters a world of horror when a mysterious disease transforms his best friend, Michael Fayne, into a murderous predator who feeds on other humans. As the disease spreads and more people are transformed, society fractures into opposing camps pitting normal people against the growing number of these vampires. Swann races against time to understand what’s happening, while Fayne rises to become the powerful underground leader of the vampires.  The series is based on IDW Publishing's V-Wars franchise, written by New York Times best-selling author Jonathan Maberry. High Park Entertainment produces alongside IDW Entertainment, which will distribute the series worldwide (excluding Canada). 1-800-Missing creators William Laurin and Glenn Davis will serve as showrunners.

Television with actress Nikki Reed, his wife, via their Rare Bird Productions banner. He is repped by ICM Partners, Untitled Entertainment and Morris Yorn.  V-Wars arrives as Netflix continues to spend an estimated $8 billion annually on original programming.

While Emma spent some time in the UK earlier this year shooting her new film The Favourite, a further trip to London paved the way for them to reconnect. “Andrew’s feelings for Emma never softened and now they are growing close once again,” the source said.  Emma, 28, and Andrew, 34, enjoyed an on again off again romance for four years. In the early 2010’s, these two were Hollywood’s sweethearts after meeting during screentest for The Amazing Spider-Man.

Everything is love and smiles until rumors aired that the pair was taking a break from their relationship in early 2015. They finally announced their so-called definitive separation later that year.

However, it is important to clarify that Sheeran did not violate any friendship code between him and Swift. Reports suggesting otherwise are unfounded and misleading.

In a recent article by HollywoodLife, titled ""Ed Sheeran Gushes Over Taylor Swift's Nemesis Katy Perry – Breaking Friend Code?"", the webloid stirs the pot by highlighting Sheeran's positive comments about Perry during the interview. The site also raises questions about how Swift might feel about this, considering her alleged feud with Perry.

It is worth noting that Swift has never publicly confirmed the identity of the person behind her song ""Bad Blood,"" which is believed to be about her feud with Perry that began in 2014. While Perry and Swift's relationship has been tumultuous, Sheeran's involvement in Perry's interview should not be interpreted as a betrayal of his friendship with Swift.

It is important to exercise caution when interpreting celebrity interactions and avoid jumping to conclusions. Gossip Cop, a reliable source for debunking celebrity gossip, can confirm that Ed Sheeran did not break any friendship code with Taylor Swift through his appearance on Katy Perry's interview. Any claims suggesting otherwise should be disregarded."

gossipcop-1289487505,"After years of overexposure thanks to his star-making turn in Twilight, Robert Pattinson values his privacy.  The actor appears on the September cover of GQ where he explained why he chooses to stay very quiet when it comes to his private life.  “I always think the risk reward is very much weighted in the wrong direction,” Pattinson, 31, said of opening up in interviews. “If I could stay silent, I would.”  Pattinson has been dating singer F.K.A. Twigs since 2014, and recently told Howard Stern they were “kind of” engaged. But when asked by GQ if he was getting married, the actor — who revealed he calls his girlfriend Twigs — responded with a noncommittal “eh.”  Daniel Jackson/GQ  Pattinson said that he went to therapy a few years ago – and his therapist commented that he was good at “talking without saying anything.” He said he uses that skill in all his interviews. The Good Time actor explained that he chooses to stay private so people don’t form ideas about his personality that may later change and label him as dishonest.  RELATED: Celeb Quotes of the Day: Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone & More  “I want to be misunderstood,” he told the magazine after declining to talk about anything personal. “People are always changing, and the more you put something down in print, people form opinions and they’re constantly creating who they think you are.

If he noticed he was being followed by paparazzi, he would pop into the garages, change, and leave in a different car.  He would also try to confuse photographers by having all of his friends order different rides out of restaurants when they were together and sending the cars to different places after trading outfits with one of his friends. Pattinson also recalled riding in trunks several times to hide from the photographers – and once drove around all night when one was tailing him to find out where his new house is.  “There are ways to disappear, like, fairly easily,” he said. “It just involves effort, and most people can’t be bothered to put the effort in.”  Good Time hits theaters August 11.",1,en,"After years of overexposure thanks to his star-making turn in Twilight, Robert Pattinson values his privacy.

In a candid interview featured on the September cover of GQ, the actor elaborated on his preference for keeping his personal life closely guarded. ""The balance between risk and reward is often skewed in the wrong direction,"" shared the 31-year-old star when discussing the challenges of opening up in interviews. ""If given the choice, I would opt to maintain silence.""

Pattinson has been involved romantically with singer F.K.A. Twigs since 2014, and recently mentioned during an interview with Howard Stern that they were ""kind of"" engaged. However, when GQ inquired further about his marital status, the actor responded with a noncommittal ""eh."" 

Pattinson recounted a valuable insight gained from therapy a few years ago about his ability to ""talk without saying anything,"" which he admits he utilizes in all his interactions with the media. The Good Time actor explained that his desire for privacy stems from a desire to prevent the formation of fixed perceptions about his personality that may later prove to be inaccurately aligned, potentially leading to accusations of dishonesty.

""I aspire to be misunderstood,"" he articulated to the magazine, firmly refusing to delve into any personal matters. ""People evolve incessantly, and by committing thoughts to print, individuals form opinions that concretize an image of who they believe you are. Should you undertake actions that challenge or deviate from this preconceived notion, you risk being unjustly labeled or accused of being deceptive.""

Pattinson also shared anecdotes about the lengths he has gone to in order to secure a semblance of privacy amid the frenzy surrounding the Twilight phenomenon. Recalling his tactics during paparazzi pursuits, he disclosed his strategic placement of various cars across Los Angeles, complete with spare outfits for quick changes. Should he detect the presence of an unwelcome entourage, he would conveniently disappear into a nearby garage, change attire, and emerge driving a different vehicle. Moreover, he would confound photographers by arranging for different rides to whisk away him and his friends after meals, exchanging garments with a companion to further confuse onlookers. Additionally, on multiple occasions, the actor mentioned resorting to traversing in car trunks or driving aimlessly throughout the night to elude the relentless pursuit of photographers. 

""There are indeed methods of dissipating into anonymity,"" he asserted. ""Yet, they demand tireless exertion, an effort that most individuals are simply disinclined to exert.""

Be sure to catch Pattinson in his latest film, Good Time, when it hits theaters on August 11."

EARLIER: Tessa Thompson is among the many women taking part in the Time’s Up initiative, which made its presence felt at last night’s Golden Globes ceremony. In an Instagram comment, the star of “Thor: Ragnarok” said planning for the red carpet the day before the event required “6 hours, 60 artists, 8 activists and a lot of coffee.” And one of those people, Thompson said, was not Lena Dunham.  In the celebratory photo Thompson posted yesterday are Michelle Williams, Billie Jean King, Rashida Jones, Susan Sarandon, Laura Dern — and, on the end of the middle row, far right, is Dunham. The “Girls” creator and star has lain low of late; the last Tweet she wrote was an apology for casting doubt on Aurora Perrineau’s rape accusation. And, according to Thompson, her participation in Time’s Up planning was limited to the photo op: “Lena was not anywhere present in our group during the countless hours of work for the last two months.”  Thompson’s statement, which came in response to several commenters questioning why Dunham was in the picture at all, reads in full:  “Lena was not anywhere present in our group during the countless hours of work for the last two months. We hosted an open house for actresses for red carpet messaging and Lena presence was a surprise to us all. This is a time of reckoning. And for many, a re-education. So many women also have real work to do. I’m afraid it’s too nuanced a conversation to have on this platform. But I hear you, and know that your thoughts and words are not lost on me. It’s been discussed”  What’s next for the initiative remains to be seen, but it shows no signs of slowing down. Most attendees wore black last night in recognition of the sexual-harassment problem in Hollywood and beyond, and Time’s Up was brought up several times throughout the ceremony.  When asked to comment by IndieWire, Dunham responded, “I was honored to be invited to the meeting by a close friend and to observe the work that these amazing women have been doing the past few months. For highly personal reasons, I’ve been unable to join previous efforts but being asked to be a part of this celebratory moment was truly beautiful.

Celebrity Big Brother is reportedly willing to make a significant investment to secure the presence of Caitlyn Jenner in the upcoming series of the show. Jenner recently arrived in London to promote her new autobiography, ""The Secrets Of My Life"", leading to speculation about a potential secret meeting with the show's producers. Sources from the Daily Star have revealed that the bookers are highly interested in having Jenner on the show, recognizing her potential as a ratings-boosting asset due to the global fascination with her story. 

Jenner's experience in reality television is well-established, having been a prominent figure on ""Keeping Up With The Kardashians"" and having her own show, ""I Am Cait"". Given the ongoing tension within the Kardashian/Jenner family, this appearance could offer Jenner a chance to address any misconceptions and clarify her perspective. In a recent interview on Australia's Today Show, Jenner expressed her love for Kim Kardashian but admitted that they haven't communicated in a while, choosing to keep her distance in order to minimize drama. 

Kim Kardashian, in turn, defended her mother Kris during a recent interview with Ellen DeGeneres, suggesting that Jenner may not be entirely truthful in her memoir. Kardashian expressed sympathy for her mother, emphasizing that she believes the claims made by Jenner are unnecessary and unfair. 

We eagerly await further updates on this potential star-studded collaboration."
gossipcop-7658353025,"“A Star Is Born” is that thing we always yearn for but so rarely get to see: a transcendent Hollywood movie. It’s the fourth remake of a story that dates back to 1932, but this one has a look and vibe all its own — rapturous and swooning, but also delicate and intimate and luminous. It’s set in the present day, but in spirit it’s a sophisticated retro ’70s drama built around the uncanny flow of feeling that develops between the movie’s two stars: Bradley Cooper, who plays Jackson Maine, a hard-drinking, bad-ol’-boy redneck rock ‘n’ roller who is still hanging on as a popular attraction but has lost the lust for what he’s doing, and Lady Gaga, in her fetching and accomplished movie-star debut, as Ally, an ingenuous, fresh-faced singer-songwriter who becomes his lover and stage partner before rocketing on her own into the new pop stratosphere. She takes off as he slowly crashes — that’s the soapy tragic “Star Is Born” concept. But what the movie does is to take this fabled melodramatic romantic seesaw and turn it into something indelibly heartfelt and revealing. Cooper directed the movie himself, working from a script he co-wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, and to say that he does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment. As a filmmaker, Bradley Cooper gets right onto the high wire, staging scenes that take their time and play out with a shaggy intimacy that’s shorn of the usual “beats.” The new “Star Is Born” is a total emotional knockout, but it’s also a movie that gets you to believe, at every step, in the complicated rapture of the story it’s telling. More Reviews Venice Film review: 'Isis, Tomorrow. The Lost Souls of Mosul' Telluride Film Review: 'They'll Love Me When I'm Dead' The 1976 version, starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, had some terrific cornball love songs, but they didn’t belong anywhere near the stadium-rock stage, and neither did Streisand, which is part of why the movie came off as borderline ludicrous. It seemed stranded, with a kind of campy sincere ineptitude, between three worlds: Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand rock-princess fantasy. But from the electrifying opening moments of the new version, in which Jackson, boozy and raw, with his sunburned squint and hard-bitten shit-kicker sexiness, takes the stage of a gigantic stadium and launches into a grinding slow rocker that sounds like “Victim of Love”-era Eagles as done by the Allman Brothers, the movie is thrillingly authentic. That’s no minor accomplishment. Hollywood almost never succeeds in nailing the rock world, but “A Star Is Born,” though a love story through and through, is the most lived-in rock ‘n’ roll movie since “Almost Famous.” And that absolute looks right, sounds right, feels right verisimilitude sets the stage for everything that follows. Jackson, who looks to be in his mid-40s, has been around long enough that he now occupies a grey zone between legend and nostalgia.

It’s the fourth remake of a story that dates back to 1932, but this one has a look and vibe all its own — rapturous and swooning, but also delicate and intimate and luminous. It’s set in the present day, but in spirit it’s a sophisticated retro ’70s drama built around the uncanny flow of feeling that develops between the movie’s two stars: Bradley Cooper, who plays Jackson Maine, a hard-drinking, bad-ol’-boy redneck rock ‘n’ roller who is still hanging on as a popular attraction but has lost the lust for what he’s doing, and Lady Gaga, in her fetching and accomplished movie-star debut, as Ally, an ingenuous, fresh-faced singer-songwriter who becomes his lover and stage partner before rocketing on her own into the new pop stratosphere. She takes off as he slowly crashes — that’s the soapy tragic “Star Is Born” concept. But what the movie does is to take this fabled melodramatic romantic seesaw and turn it into something indelibly heartfelt and revealing. Cooper directed the movie himself, working from a script he co-wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, and to say that he does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment. As a filmmaker, Bradley Cooper gets right onto the high wire, staging scenes that take their time and play out with a shaggy intimacy that’s shorn of the usual “beats.” The new “Star Is Born” is a total emotional knockout, but it’s also a movie that gets you to believe, at every step, in the complicated rapture of the story it’s telling. More Reviews Venice Film review: 'Isis, Tomorrow. The Lost Souls of Mosul' Telluride Film Review: 'They'll Love Me When I'm Dead' The 1976 version, starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, had some terrific cornball love songs, but they didn’t belong anywhere near the stadium-rock stage, and neither did Streisand, which is part of why the movie came off as borderline ludicrous. It seemed stranded, with a kind of campy sincere ineptitude, between three worlds: Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand rock-princess fantasy. But from the electrifying opening moments of the new version, in which Jackson, boozy and raw, with his sunburned squint and hard-bitten shit-kicker sexiness, takes the stage of a gigantic stadium and launches into a grinding slow rocker that sounds like “Victim of Love”-era Eagles as done by the Allman Brothers, the movie is thrillingly authentic. That’s no minor accomplishment. Hollywood almost never succeeds in nailing the rock world, but “A Star Is Born,” though a love story through and through, is the most lived-in rock ‘n’ roll movie since “Almost Famous.” And that absolute looks right, sounds right, feels right verisimilitude sets the stage for everything that follows. Jackson, who looks to be in his mid-40s, has been around long enough that he now occupies a grey zone between legend and nostalgia. He can still fill an arena full of screaming fans, and his old hits have become classic-rock chestnuts, but his sound and persona have long slipped out of the zeitgeist. His whole outlaw look — the beard and rancher’s hat, the Kristofferson-meets-Skynyrd soused macho twinkle — mark him as a charismatic relic, and the grand irony is this: What that look, and sound, are all about is an era when rock ‘n’ roll strutted its “authenticity,” but now that he’s out of date, Jackson’s authenticity looks more than ever like a showbiz conceit, frozen in amber. It’s a part he’s playing, an image he’s working — and secretly struggling — to keep alive. He’s got a signature ballad that goes “Maybe it’s time to let the old ways die,” and when he wrote it (long ago), he probably didn’t know that he was talking about himself. In the first of many telling jump cuts, the film leaps from his on-stage glory to Jackson slinking into the back of his car, weary and alone, grabbing the bottle of gin he’s got stashed there. He takes a guzzle, and Cooper, acting with his body, lets you feel just how much Jackson (between sickly coughs) needs the lifeblood of that drink. It’s what he believes in more than the show he’s just finished. How do you play a drunk? We know, of course, that the answer is not to “play drunk,” but Cooper doesn’t just avoid the usual slurry shambling (though at key moments he does a little of that too, and it’s powerful). He brings off something I’ve rarely seen done this exquisitely: He plays blitzed, very functional and in his element, his smile and reflexes greased by the liquor. Jackson speaks in a deep, low, deliberate Southern-stud growl — a voice with real music in it, though one that lets you taste all the booze it’s marinated in. Needing another drink, he has his driver drop him off at the first available bar, which turns out to be a roadside dive on drag-queen karaoke night. It’s not his scene, but he doesn’t mind. He’s the same celebrity everywhere he goes, so he’s in the perfect mood of lit-up contentment when she walks on stage. She is Ally, the one non-drag performer of the night (she’s friends with all the queens there, so they let her sing for real). When she enters the room, the movie pulls off a neat trick. We’ve already seen Ally break up with her boyfriend over the phone, letting out a banshee wail in the process, and when she appears in heavy white-make up and pasted on half-circle eyebrows, her hair teased into a punked-out French pastry, then does a strutting-down-the-bar version of “La Vie en Rose” that she milks for every flourish of theatrical kitsch she can, we think, “Of course! How Gaga-netic!” Backstage after the show, Jackson gently pulls off one of Ally’s eyebrows and asks her out for a drink. But when she emerges from the dressing room","""A Star Is Born"" is an exceptional Hollywood film that captures the transcendence we all yearn for but rarely witness. This fourth adaptation of an age-old tale, dating back to 1932, possesses a distinct elegance and atmosphere of its own. Its ethereal and intimate essence, coupled with its luminosity, makes it a truly remarkable experience. Although the story is set in the present, its spirit reflects a sophisticated retro '70s drama, centered around the profound connection formed between the film's two stars. Bradley Cooper, portraying the character of Jackson Maine, a weathered and weary rock 'n' roller clinging onto his fading popularity, and Lady Gaga, in her captivating and accomplished movie debut as Ally, an untainted and talented singer-songwriter, embark on a journey that propels Ally into the stratosphere of pop music while Jackson spirals downward. This classic tragic concept is transformed into an indescribably heartfelt and revealing masterpiece by Bradley Cooper, who takes the reins as director from a script he co-wrote alongside Eric Roth and Will Fetters. To say that Cooper does justice to the film would be an understatement. As a filmmaker, he fearlessly walks the tightrope, orchestrating deliberately paced scenes that exude an authentic and unscripted intimacy. ""A Star Is Born"" is a truly emotionally captivating experience, and it effortlessly instills a sense of belief in the intricate and spellbinding story it presents. In contrast, the 1976 version starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson contained a collection of sensational melodramatic love songs. Unfortunately, these pieces did not blend well within the stadium-rock era, and even Streisand's presence felt out of place, resulting in a film that teetered on the verge of ludicrousness. It seemed stranded, unsure of its identity amidst the realms of Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand's rock-star fantasy. However, in the electrifying opening moments of the updated ""A Star Is Born,"" where a boozy and rugged Jackson takes the stage with a sunburned squint and an irresistible aura of machismo, the film effortlessly captivates. With a grinding slow-rocker reminiscent of the Eagles' ""Victim of Love"" era as performed by the Allman Brothers, the authenticity of the movie becomes instantly palpable. This achievement is no small feat. Hollywood rarely manages to capture the essence of the rock world, but ""A Star Is Born"" not only serves as an immersive love story, but it also stands as the most authentic rock 'n' roll film since ""Almost Famous."" The film's genuine verisimilitude, which resonates visually, aurally, and emotionally, forms a solid foundation upon which everything unfolds. Jackson, appearing to be in his mid-40s, resides in a gray area somewhere between legend and nostalgia. While he can still fill arenas with adoring fans, his older hits have transitioned into beloved classics, and both his sound and persona have gradually slipped away from the zeitgeist. His entire outlaw persona, complete with a rugged beard and a rancher's hat, coupled with a combination of Kris Kristofferson and Lynyrd Skynyrd's rugged allure, positions him as a charming relic. Paradoxically, this image reflects an era when rock 'n' roll reveled in its authenticity. However, now that he is outdated, Jackson's authenticity serves as a showbiz facade, forever frozen in time. It's a role he continues to play, a persona he struggles to maintain secretly. Jackson possesses a signature ballad with the lyrics, ""Maybe it's time to let the old ways die,"" a song he likely wrote without knowing he was revealing his own fate. In a series of poignant jump cuts, the film transitions from Jackson's on-stage glory to a weary and desolate figure slinking into the backseat of his car, immediately reaching for the bottle of gin he has stashed for this very purpose. Through Cooper's masterful acting, the audience can truly feel the profound yearning for that drink, which Jackson believes in more than the captivating performance he just concluded. Portraying a drunken character is a challenging task, and Cooper expertly navigates this territory. Rather than resorting to exaggerated slurred speech, he skillfully portrays a functional drunk, seamlessly blending into his element. His grin and reflexes are fueled by liquor, while his voice emanates a deep, deliberate, and distinct Southern accent infused with the essence of alcohol. Desiring another drink, Jackson instructs his driver to take him to the nearest bar, which happens to be a roadside dive hosting drag-queen karaoke night. Although this setting isn't his usual scene, Jackson remains unfazed. Regardless of his location, he remains a celebrity, finding solace in the radiant contentment that accompanies his fame. It is during this fateful evening that Ally takes the stage, the sole non-drag performer among a sea of queens. The film executes a clever twist, juxtaposing Ally's powerful emotional outburst during her breakup over the phone with her transformation into an enigmatic figure adorned with heavy white makeup, exaggerated eyebrows, and a punk-inspired hairdo. Her rendition of ""La Vie en Rose,"" complete with theatrical flourishes, exudes a theatrical kitsch that is so quintessentially Gaga. Following the show, Jackson tenderly removes an eyebrow from Ally and extends an invitation for a drink. Emerging from the dressing room"

The couple “vowed to keep their relationship to themselves.

Swept away by their hidden romance, Swift is said to be deeply in love with Alwyn, and their discreet relationship has granted her unparalleled happiness.

A source close to the couple revealed, ""Joe has imparted upon Taylor a newfound appreciation for a life shielded from the public eye. As a result, she has never experienced such genuine contentment before."" This significant change has had a profound effect on Swift’s overall quality of life, as another insider affirmed, ""Taylor is undeniably happier now that her personal life remains insulated from prying eyes. She attributes this newfound happiness to Joe and recognizes the tremendous benefits it has brought her.""

In a marked departure from her usual approach, Swift has deliberately refrained from discussing her relationship with Alwyn during interviews. The paparazzi have struggled to capture their moments together, although recent snapshots captured the couple holding hands during a vacation in Turks and Caicos Islands. A witness on the trip remarked, ""They exuded an unmistakable joy, constantly radiating with smiles whilst maintaining a remarkable closeness. However, they also retained a strong desire to keep their romance to themselves.""

Us Weekly's sources caution that Swift is unlikely to openly divulge any details about her connection with Alwyn in the near future. The couple has made a solemn pledge to safeguard their love from public scrutiny, going to great lengths to maintain their privacy."

Years later, Brad regrets leaving the Friends star for his now-ex Angelina Jolie, a source told In Touch exclusively.  Following his 2016 separation from Angie, Brad sobered up and sought therapy. And now, he’s “in touch with emotions and his true self like never before,” the source says.  Brad Pitt finally opens up about his bitter divorce with Angelina Jolie  And it seems like this self-awareness comes with some great realisations. “He has come to realise that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,” the source adds. “And while he’s not in love with Jen, he realises how much he does love her. Brad keeps telling friends that he’s seeing everything more clearly.”  However, these realisations are obviously far too late. Jennifer has been married to Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for two years now.  And while Brad would “never dream of” ruining his ex’s new marriage, he “would take a second chance at love with Jen in a heartbeat.”  If they can’t be romantic partners, though, the War Machine star wants Jen to be his partner in other pursuits, In Touch further reported.  Brad Pitt “much happier” following split from Angelina Jolie  “They worked well together” when they formed the production company Plan B in 2001, an insider close to Brad told In Touch. “He wants Jen involved again as he produces and develops more and more high-quality film and cable TV products.”  That kind of professional partnership could pay off for Jen, too, since the insider states she wants in on “prestige projects” under his production banner. “She’d be beyond thrilled to win an Academy Award for Best Actress — something that’s evaded both her and Angelina.”  “He still considers Jen the love of his life,” the source concluded.

Read full story","After seeking therapy and reflecting on his past, actor Brad Pitt has come to a profound realization about his former relationship with actress Jennifer Aniston. Sources close to the actor have revealed that Pitt deeply regrets leaving Aniston for his now-ex Angelina Jolie.

Following his separation from Jolie in 2016, Pitt made the decision to embrace sobriety and engage in therapy, which has provided him with a newfound emotional clarity. This newfound self-awareness has led him to acknowledge that leaving Aniston for Jolie was one of the biggest mistakes of his life. While Pitt may not be in love with Aniston currently, he has realized the depth of his love for her and expresses that he now sees things more clearly.

However, these realizations come too late, as Aniston has been happily married to her Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for the past two years. Pitt has no intention of interfering with her current relationship. Nevertheless, he does admit that he would seize the opportunity for a second chance at love with Aniston in a heartbeat, but strictly if the circumstances allowed it.

In addition to a romantic connection, Pitt aspires to have a professional partnership with Aniston. They previously collaborated successfully when they formed the production company Plan B in 2001. Pitt hopes to involve Aniston once again as he continues to produce and develop high-quality film and cable TV projects. This collaboration could be advantageous for both parties, as Aniston also desires to partake in prestigious projects under Pitt's production banner, aiming to achieve an Academy Award for Best Actress, an accolade that has eluded both her and Jolie.

It is evident that Brad Pitt still considers Jennifer Aniston the love of his life, concludes the source. Although the opportunity for a romantic reunion may be out of reach, it is apparent that Pitt values Aniston as a significant presence in both his personal and professional life.

If anything, the album seems like an meek afterthought to the Twitter tirade and dive into right-wing politics. Most of it deals with the repercussions of the storm which came before it, and for the first time in his career, the artist’s personality is overwhelming the art.  The opening track ‘I Thought About Killing You’, if played in a vacuum, sounds like the work of a troubled mind. If a poem like this came from a loved one, it would surely merit discussion about a trip to the therapist. Kanye goes on to deliver cringe-worthy rhymes on issues ranging from Russell Simmons rape allegations to his petrification on realizing that his daughter might one day look like his wife.

The usual meticulousness and perfectionism has apparently been supplanted by a Kanye shrug. The music is haphazard and hollow, mirroring the guy making it.

Upon initial listening, it becomes apparent that no part of ye was recorded prior to the controversial MAGA hat snapshot, which dismantles the assertion that his prior month's actions were merely a calculated publicity stunt to promote the album.

In 2005, Jennifer Aniston was named godmother of Courteney Cox’s daughter, Coco Arquette.","Jennifer Aniston and Lisa Kudrow, known for their roles as Rachel Green and Phoebe Buffay in the iconic sitcom ""Friends,"" have recently shared heartwarming anecdotes that exemplify the close bond they formed on set. Lisa Kudrow, in a recent interview with People, revealed that during her pregnancy in Seasons 4 and 5, her co-stars adjusted their pre-show ritual to include her unborn child, Julian Murray Stern, who is now 20 years old.

Prior to each performance, the cast members would gather backstage for a huddle, exchanging well wishes before going on stage. However, when Lisa Kudrow was expecting, her colleagues made a thoughtful alteration to this tradition. Kudrow explained, ""The six of us would do a huddle backstage and just say, 'All right, have a good show, love you love you love you love you.' And when I was pregnant, then they would say, 'Have a great show, love you love you — love you, little Julian!' Cause we knew it was a boy and that was his name."" Kudrow fondly added, ""So sweet, they included my little fetus in the huddle.""

The camaraderie among the ""Friends"" cast extended beyond pregnancy rituals. In 2005, Jennifer Aniston was honored with the role of godmother to Courteney Cox's daughter, Coco Arquette, further solidifying the deep bonds that were formed during their time working together.

These gestures of support and inclusion serve as a testament to the enduring friendship and genuine affection shared by the cast of ""Friends."" Their willingness to embrace and celebrate each other's milestones, both on and off-screen, exemplifies the strong bond that made the show such a beloved cultural phenomenon."

Kim had been asked – again – to discuss his decision to exit the CBS procedural, a topic that has been covered long and often since it happened.  “I’ve known [CBS Entertainment President] Kelly [Kahl] and [CBS SEVP Programming] Thom [Sherman] for a while…I know them, and like them, and am grateful to them for the words they said on their panel the other day.”  “That said, it’s possible to be grateful and respectful, and still maintain a steadfast sense of your self worth,” Kim said, pointedly.  Days earlier at TCA, Kahl and Sherman took multiple questions about the controversial exits of Hawaii Five-0‘s two Asian co-stars, Kim and Grace Park, who sought parity with the show’s leads, Alex O’Loughlin and Scott Caan, and left after not getting equal pay.  “We never like to lose characters audiences love but that happens on long-running series,” Kahl had said that morning. “We made very lucrative offers to those actors,” he added, while declining to name the dollar amount or how it compared to the salaries of series stars O’Loughlin and Caan. Kim and Park, whose roles had been conceived as supporting, had made less from the get-go; sources said they were offered salaries close to, but not equal to, that of the leads.  Saying it was time to “close that chapter…and begin this chapter” of his life, Kim said this morning he “could not be more excited to be back on ABC,” where he had been part of the cast of Lost, which he credited with launching his career. “This is the start of something new.”  And yet, the first question asked during The Good Doctor Q&A was from a critic demanding to know how come he’s not on the CBS series and is now “behind the scenes” on ABC’s doc drama.  “Good morning,” Kim responded calmly, getting a laugh.  “I’m very proud to be part of this show,” said Kim, who is exec producer on The Good Doctor, which he says he first saw several years ago in Korea and brought to ABC.  “It started as a Korean show,” Kim said. “I loved the message of it,” noting also that the doctor drama is a “familiar genre to American audiences.” The Good Doctor centers on Shaun Murphy (Freddie Highmore), a young surgeon with autism and savant syndrome, who leaves a quiet country life to join a prestigious hospital’s surgical unit.  Kim said he brought the format to the U.S., calling it “crucial” to have signed House’s David Shore as EP.  “I am really content being behind the scenes” on the new ABC drama, Kim says, calling it “fascinating” to watch the actors, as a producer.  “At some point I would love to play with them…David and I have talked about it in the past and we’ll see what comes up.’",0,en,0,"Hawaii Five-O “was a really important part of my life for seven years, and I’m grateful to CBS and everyone involved with the show for giving me the opportunity,” Daniel Dae Kim said at TCA this morning during a Q&A for ABC’s new The Good Doctor, on which he is EP.

The No10 seed deflected a series of queries about the wrongful-death lawsuit filed on Thursday before she became overcome with emotion, prompting the moderator to request that journalists refrained from asking about the incident.  Venus Williams ‘at fault’ in fatal car crash, say Florida police Read more  “There are really no words to describe, like, how devastating and – yeah. I’m completely speechless. It’s just – yeah, I mean, I’m just …” a visibly shaken Williams said, her voice trailing off.  The seven-times major champion then broke down in tears, stepping out into the hallway to gather herself with members of her team.  Williams returned after about five minutes to field five more questions, mostly related to her 7-6 (7), 6-4 win against Belgium’s Elise Mertens amid wildly fluctuating weather on No1 Court, as the sun‑splashed afternoon gave way to blustery conditions and ultimately rain.  The American – at 37 the oldest woman in the draw here – was at her imperious best in the opening stages, breaking Mertens in her opening service game and dictating points with her serve. But Mertens, who was not born when Williams turned professional and only four when she won the first of her five Wimbledon singles titles, overcame those initial nerves and began challenging Williams with powerful groundstrokes into the corners and well-concealed variety.  Mertens blinked during the first-set tiebreak, then surrendered her early service break in the second. Rain interrupted play with the 21-year-old, who had just saved her second match point with a gorgeous backhand lob, serving at 3-5, 40-40 in the second set.  After a 33-minute delay Williams finished the job, uncorking an overhead smash to see off Mertens after an hour and 40 minutes and booking a second-round match against China’s Qiang Wang.  The American flashed her familiar smile after meeting her opponent at the net but it became clear during the press conference that her 20th appearance at the tournament she has won five times will be loaded with emotion.  “You can’t prepare for everything,” Williams said. “I have no idea what tomorrow will bring. That’s all I can say about it. That’s what I’ve learned.”  Palm Beach Gardens police said witnesses told investigators that Williams ran a red light in her Toyota Sequoia SUV at around 1pm on 9 June, injuring 79-year-old Jerome Barson, who died 13 days later. Barson was riding in the passenger seat when the Hyundai Accent driven by his wife, Linda, crashed into the side of Williams’s vehicle.  Williams told investigators she entered the six-lane intersection on a green light but was forced to stop midway through because of traffic ahead of her, failing to see the Barsons’ car when she continued through at about 5mph.  But police concluded the driver of Williams’s car “is at fault for violating the right of way”. Linda Barson, 68, also sustained injuries, including “a cracked sternum, shattered right arm, broken wrist, hand and fingers”.  Williams made her first public comments on the incident in a Facebook post on Friday night, describing herself as “heartbroken”.  One of only two former Wimbledon champions in the women’s field, Williams has a promising draw and perhaps a renewed ambition after her inspired run to the Australian Open final in January – a remarkable feat given the incurable autoimmune disease that has hamstrung her game for most of the decade.",0,en,0,"• American walks out of after media questions about Florida crash • Five-times champion beats Elise Mertens 7-6, 6-4 in first round  A tearful Venus Williams walked out of her press conference on Monday after her first-round victory at Wimbledon, the American’s first match since her involvement in a fatal car accident in Florida that police allege she caused.

The live-action film dropped its first teaser trailer Thursday. It came a day after Will Smith, who plays Genie, showed off the film's poster featuring the magical gold lamp.  The teaser set ups the menace Aladdin (Mena Massoud) faces finding the lamp, which grants wishes courtesy of Genie.  A menacing voice refers to the street-wise character as ""a diamond in the rough"" before showing him about to take hold of the lamp.  Smith has still not been revealed as Genie. The star teased that his magical character was stuck inside the gold lamp when he showed the poster on his Facebook page Wednesday.  ""LEMME OUT!! :-),"" Smith wrote.

Honestly, Justin handled himself pretty well in the face of a highly inappropriate and boundary-crossing question. Agree?","Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin recently announced their engagement after a month of dating, bringing about a wave of speculation regarding the motives behind their decision. While it is evident that Justin and Hailey are deeply in love and committed to a lifelong partnership, there has been a rumor circulating in certain corners of the internet, particularly on Twitter, suggesting that Hailey may be pregnant. It is crucial to emphasize that such personal matters are entirely private and should not be subjected to public scrutiny, as it can perpetuate sexist attitudes.

During a casual encounter, a discussion arose between Justin and a paparazzo, who inquired about the pregnancy rumors, posing the question, ""Is Hailey pregnant right now? You stated that you guys are family, so everybody was thinking she might be pregnant."" Justin, displaying composure and grace, promptly addressed the paparazzo's inappropriate line of questioning, stating, ""What's your deal, bro? You just seem too normal to be doing this job... I just don’t understand why you gotta try to get a rise, you know what I’m saying?"" When the paparazzo attempted to explain himself, Justin retorted, ""No, you know what you’re doing,"" before eventually requesting that the camera be turned off.

In this situation, it must be acknowledged that Justin exhibited admirable restraint and poise when confronted with a highly inappropriate and boundary-crossing question. His response serves as a reminder that public figures, like anyone else, deserve respect for their personal lives and should not be subjected to invasive inquiries."

According to People , Amber's tweets came in response to actor Armie Hammer tweeting to Woods, ""Didn't you date a 19 year old when you were 60.......?"" following Woods's criticism of Armie's upcoming film, in which he plays a 24-year-old dating a 17-year-old.  ""James Woods tried to pick me and my friend up at a restaurant once. He wanted to take us to Vegas. 'I'm 16' I said. 'Even better' he said,"" Amber tweeted.

""Damn totally forgot about that,"" the friend replied.  Many on Twitter have responded to the allegations, some supporting Amber and making allegations of their own.  James, however, equated much of the response to his initial tweet about Armie Hammer's movie, Call Me by Your Name , to ""trolls,"" even adding that he likes Armie as an actor.

gossipcop-895055,"Viewers of the 2017 American Music Awards witnessed history.  Introduced by The Chainsmokers, BTS made their U.S. television debut at the 2017 American Music Awards on Sunday, November 19th. BTS is taking the U.S over a landslide by being the first Korean Pop Boy Band to perform on a major American awards show.  BTS delivered their latest hit “DNA” with flashy choreography and enormous support from their A.R.M.Y. (a name given to their international fanbase) who accompanied them with chants throughout their performance. Tweets during and after their epic performance took over social media with the hashtag #BTSxAMAs. Fans, attendees and those new to the K-pop boy band fanbase obsessed over their amazing dance moves, voice control, red carpet fashion and physical aspect of the members of the boy band.  BTS (currently standing for ‘Behind the Scenes’) is a seven-member South Korean Pop Band formed by Big Hit Entertainment. While most boy bands in the U.S. have from three to five members in their groups, South Korean bands are internationally known for having more than 10 members in the band.  Jin, J-Hope, RM (known as Rap Monster), Suga, Jimin, V and Jungkook are taking over the world as BTS with their latest album “Love Yourself: Her” which has helped them become the highest charting K-pop group on the Billboard Hot 100.  Their performance at the 2017 AMA’s was highly anticipated by fans of the band when they announced it on social media. ’To call this guys International superstars honestly seems like an understatement’ said Drew Taggart from The Chainsmokers before the boys bounded on stage  During their performance, fans were not the only ones freaking out. Almost everyone, including celebrity guests like Ansel Elgort, was on their feet cheering and singing along with the band. Ansel even appeared to be recording the performance on his phone. “I need a moment to recover from that performance.

gossipcop-1716370499,"Dakota Johnson; most of us know her as the actress from Fifty Shades of Grey. While we may have seen Johnson in some pretty intimate positions on-screen, there’s definitely a lot we don’t know about the Fifty Shades star. Like, for instance, the superfluity of familiar names in her family tree. Seeing that her popular movie, Fifty Shades Darker came out on the day of love—Valentine's Day—it's only fitting to dedicate a piece to the actress who brought us the sexy and quaint, Anastasia Steele. Johnson, after all, has become somewhat something of a Valentine’s Day staple, herself. Here are 15 facts about Dakota Johnson or, as some might call her, ""that girl from Fifty Shades of Grey."" We guarantee that she will no longer by ""that girl"" by the end of the list! 15 Her Family Tree Is Full Of Famous Faces You know how we said there are a few familiar names in her family tree? Well, we weren’t lying. Her parents are fellow actors, Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. Unfortunately, her parents divorced in 1994 so Dakota had to split her time between the two. ""It was the only way that I could be with them,"" she said in an interview for Cosmopolitan. ""And since they were divorced, I would spend two weeks with one and two weeks with the other, traveling with a tutor."" But wait, it gets better. Her maternal grandmother (can you guess..) is Hitchcock actress Tippi Hedren. Yes, that’s right, so clearly creative talent lies in that family. We’ve never heard of a family tree with so many famous names! Thanksgiving is probably a whirlwind. Now, Dakota Johnson is another famous name in that tree. 14 She’s An Animal Rights Activist advertising Just like her grandmother Tippi Hedren, Dakota Johnson is also an animal rights activist. Like grandmother, like granddaughter shall we say? As animal lovers ourselves, we’re pleased to hear that she’s following in her grandmother’s footsteps—both in acting and in animal rights. In 2014, Johnson saved 12 horses from being slaughtered by paying for them. What a sweet thing to do! We bet her grandmother was really proud. It’s always so great to hear about celebrities doing positive things - so naturally, we’re happy to hear of Dakota’s compassionate side. We admit we have a soft spot for animal lovers, but who doesn't? We always love hearing about people doing good deeds for animals and it’s always nice to hear celebrities using their celebrity title for the better. 13 She Grew Up Shooting Guns And Riding Horses In Colorado She may play the innocent and naive Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades movies, but growing up Johnson was anything but naive. She grew up in Colorado at her dad’s house, where she learned to build a fire, ride a horse, ride motorbikes, and even shoot a gun. And this was all before she was just 10 years old! Sounds like a badass kid to us! But when she wasn’t at her father’s house, she was at her mom’s house in L.A. which she also loved. It's hard to imagine a 10 year old these days shooting guns, riding motorbikes, or building fires without being grounded. But it sounds like she had a pretty inspiring and freeing childhood which makes us fall for the actress all the more. 12 She Never Dates advertising By the header, we mean she never has casual relationships. She only has long-term relationships. Good for her, is all we can say! You hear of so many celebrities who are constantly dating other celebrities. You can barely keep up with who they’re dating these days. It seems to be one guy or girl after another. So it’s great to hear of Dakota’s conservative views on relationships. Apparently she’s only ever been in long-term, serious relationships; she doesn’t just date. That probably explains why she’s been in a relationship with model Matthew Hitt since 2014. Yes, it’s been a kind of an on-and-off relationship but they’ve been in it for the long haul so far. So, to sum up, we like her whole dating attitude.

The commitment is great and saves you a lot of time. 11 She HATED School It seems like we have something in common with Dakota Johnson: a loathing of school. Okay, so maybe not all of you hated school - many of you probably loved school or at least thrived at school. But most of us can say with the utmost certainty that we hated school with a passion. We all have our reasons why. Johnson, for instance, hated school because she felt like an ""alien."" She said she didn’t understand the process of school as a child and felt ""suffocated."" I don't know about you guys, but I can totally relate with Dakota on this. Many of us felt like we didn’t really fit in at school so it’s especially comforting to hear that a big name like Dakota Johnson also felt like a social outcast in class. Like many of us, she preferred hanging out with her friends than going to school. But hey, we admire her honesty. 10 Auditioning Gives Her Panic Attacks advertising Watching the pristine-looking A-list celebrities gliding around the Golden Globes Award ceremony is enough to wreck your mind with self-doubt over their unbelievably high levels of confidence and self esteem. If only we could possess as much poise! The truth is, many of these celebrities don’t feel that way at all; confident and self assured, that is. Dakota Johnson, for example, gets so nervous during auditions that she often has panic attacks. And we’re not just talking a bit of breathlessness here and there, we’re talking full-on panic attacks—the real deal. So before you come to your conclusions that the celebrities you see on television and in magazines are way more confident than you’ll ever be, just remember something: every single one of them suffers from self-doubt at one point or another. It happens to all of","Dakota Johnson, widely recognized for her role in Fifty Shades of Grey, remains an enigma despite her on-screen intimacy. Beyond her portrayal of the alluring Anastasia Steele, there is much about the actress that remains unknown. Notably, her family tree boasts an abundance of familiar names, with her parents being fellow actors, Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. The familial bond, however, was severed in 1994, leading to Dakota's journey of splitting time and traveling with a tutor. Furthermore, her maternal grandmother happens to be none other than the renowned Hitchcock actress, Tippi Hedren, displaying a clear lineage of creative excellence.

In addition to her acting career, Dakota Johnson actively embraces the cause of animal rights, reflecting the altruistic spirit of her grandmother, Tippi Hedren. In a remarkable instance of compassion, Johnson purchased and saved twelve horses from an imminent slaughter in 2014. This noble act undoubtedly aligned with her grandmother's principles, and serves as a reminder of the positive impact celebrities can make when they leverage their influence.

While Dakota Johnson may embody the seemingly innocent Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades films, her upbringing paints a completely contrasting picture. Growing up in Colorado under her father's roof, she acquired a range of unconventional skills and experiences. From learning to build a fire and ride horses, to mastering the art of shooting guns and maneuvering motorbikes, Johnson's formative years were characterized by a remarkable sense of adventure and daring. Despite such a bold upbringing, she also relished her time with her mother in Los Angeles, creating a truly multifaceted childhood that contributes to her captivating persona.

In matters of the heart, Dakota Johnson adheres to a distinct approach. Known for her long-term commitment in relationships, Johnson diverges from the typical dating practices prevalent amongst her celebrity peers. Her conservative view on relationships is exemplified by her enduring affiliation with model Matthew Hitt, which has withstood the test of time since 2014. Her steadfast commitment demonstrates the value she places on emotional connection, a perspective worth noting in today's fast-paced dating culture.

Remarkably, Johnson openly admits to harboring a loathing for school, a sentiment many of us can relate to. She describes feeling like an ""alien"" and struggling to comprehend the purpose of formal education, ultimately feeling suffocated by the system. Johnson gravitated towards socializing with friends over attending classes, finding solace in companionship rather than conformity. Her candidness resonates with those who have experienced similar sentiments, highlighting the challenges many face within the confines of an educational institution.

It is essential to remember that the celebrities we idolize often grapple with self-doubt and anxiety, despite exuding confidence on the red carpet. Dakota Johnson exemplifies this truth, as auditions trigger panic attacks within her. The pressure and vulnerability she experiences speak to the universal nature of self-doubt, reminding us that even those we perceive as supremely self-assured battle their own internal demons.

In conclusion, Dakota Johnson's life encompasses a tapestry of compelling experiences and values that shape her identity beyond her fame as the ""girl from Fifty Shades of Grey."" Her lineage of renowned talents, commitment to animal rights, unique upbringing, conservative approach to relationships, disdain for formal education, and vulnerability in the face of auditions all contribute to her multifaceted personality. By delving deeper into her story, we unravel the layers of a truly captivating individual."

The singer also attended the wedding earlier in Saturday in Windsor.  According to the Daily Mail, John took the stage after Prince Harry, following his speech, asked his guests, “Does anyone here know how to play the piano?” John then sat by the piano and performed four songs, “Your Song,” “Circle of Life,” “I’m Still Standing” and “Tiny Dancer”; the latter song features the lyric “L.A. lady,” a nod to Markle’s acting career.

Meanwhile, Ed Sheeran & Beyoncé's ""Perfect"" leads for a second week and Migos, Nicki Minaj & Cardi B's ""MotorSport"" also zooms to the top 10. Mariah Carey's ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" hits the Billboard Hot 100's top 10 at last, jingling from No. 11 (its prior peak) to No. 9 on the chart dated Dec. 30. The modern yuletide classic reaches the top 10 for the first time 23 years after its 1994 release. Atop the Hot 100, Ed Sheeran and Beyoncé's ""Perfect"" reigns for a second week. Plus, Migos, Nicki Minaj and Cardi B's ""MotorSport"" accelerates 15-6 for its first week in the top 10 following the premiere of its official video. As we do every Monday, let's run down the top 10 of the Hot 100, which blends all-genre streaming, airplay and sales data. All charts will update on Billboard.com tomorrow (Dec. 19). Let's start with a blizzard of chart stats about Carey's ""Christmas."" Streams, Sales & Plays: First, the numbers that result in ""Christmas"" (on Columbia/Legacy Records and co-written and co-produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff) hitting the Hot 100's top 10. The song gains by 4 percent to 25.2 million U.S. streams in the week ending Dec. 14, according to Nielsen Music; dips 8 percent to 19,000 downloads sold in the same tracking span; and lifts 28 percent to 34 million in airplay audience in the week ending Dec. 17. Those totals place ""Christmas"" at No. 7 on the Streaming Songs chart, No. 13 on Digital Song Sales and No. 36 on Radio Songs. Notably, streaming is the most prominent driver of the song, accounting for 70 percent of its chart points this week. Carey's 28th Top 10: Carey collects her 28th Hot 100 top 10. ""Christmas"" is her first since ""Obsessed"" reached No. 7 in 2009. She tallied 19 top 10s in the 1990s and eight in the 2000s. (Of those, 18 hit No. 1, the most among soloists; only The Beatles have more, with 20.) Carey ties Stevie Wonder for the fifth-most Hot 100 top 10s in the chart's history (which dates to its Aug. 4, 1958, inception): Most Top 10 Hot 100 Hits 38, Madonna 34, The Beatles 31, Rihanna 29, Michael Jackson 28, Mariah Carey 28, Stevie Wonder 27, Janet Jackson 27, Elton John Top 10s in the '90s, '00s & '10s: Carey joins an elite list of acts with Hot 100 top 10s in the '90s, '00s & '10s. Its previously-inducted members: Christina Aguilera, Dr. Dre, Whitney Houston, Enrique Iglesias, Michael Jackson, JAY-Z, Jennifer Lopez, Madonna, Snoop Dogg, Britney Spears and Usher. Two of those acts boast streaks dating even further back than the '90s: Jackson ('70s-'10s) and Madonna ('80s-'10s). (As for Houston, she charted top 10s in the '80s, '90s and '00s and re-sent her 1992-93 No. 1 ""I Will Always Love You"" to No. 3 in 2012 following her passing that February. All the other acts above sent at least one song to the top 10 for the first time in each decade.) 'Christmas' in the Top 10: Perhaps surprisingly, Carey charts one of the few holiday top 10s in the Hot 100's history. ""The Chipmunk Song"" by The Chipmunks with David Seville led for four weeks beginning Dec. 22, 1958; Dan Fogelberg's ""Same Old Lang Syne"" reached No. 9 in February 1981 (after debuting in December 1980); and New Kids on the Block's ""This One's for the Children"" rose to No. 7 in the 1989-90 holiday season. No other such song reached the top 10 until Kenny G's ""Auld Lang Syne"" (No. 7, Jan. 8, 2000). Between that New Year's Eve anthem and Carey's ""Christmas,"" Justin Bieber came closest to the top 10 with ""Mistletoe,"" which hit No. 11 (Jan. 5, 2011). Carey's hit is, thus, the first Hot 100 top 10 with the word ""Christmas"" in its title. Notably, for several years in the Hot 100's history (1963-72; 1983-85, barring occasional exceptions), holiday songs were not eligible to chart, instead appearing on separate holiday rankings.

Upon its initial release, on Carey's album Merry Christmas (released on Nov. 1, 1994; coincidentally, that marked the 100th anniversary of the first Billboard magazine, dated Nov. 1, 1894), the song was not a commercially available single and, per rules at the time, was ineligible to chart on the Hot 100; it did reach No. 12 on the Radio Songs chart that season. In December 1998, album cuts became eligible for the Hot 100 and ""Christmas"" dented the chart for the first time on Jan. 8, 2000, spending a week at No. 83.

gossipcop-867532,"With new Bachelorette Becca Kufrin waiting in the wings to find her true love, former Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay is out of the spotlight — that’s probably just how she wants it. She chose Miami-based doctor Bryan Abasolo at the end of her season, and the two walked into the sunset together during the 2017 finale. But, as we know, relationships founded on The Bachelor and The Bachelorette can have, let’s say, short shelf lives. Bachelorette stars Rachel and Bryan still together in 2018?  Rachel took to television in 2017 with the dream of finding a man. And she found two! It came down to Bryan and Wisconsin-based personal trainer Peter Kraus. The finale was tough to watch, as Peter and Rachel seemed like a better match to many fans but Peter wasn’t convinced that he could be engaged after knowing someone for, like, six weeks (imagine that). That didn’t fly with Rachel, and the two had a really emotional breakup, one that Rachel thinks overshadowed the fact that she found longtime love with Bryan.  “I wish you were able to really see more of Bryan. [The breakup with Peter] really did overshadow, I felt, a happy moment for us, like one of the best moments of my life,” Rachel told Us Weekly. “I’ve never been engaged before and neither has Bryan, and I felt like we were more on the defense about our relationship and having to explain more of it than rather it just showing … So I just wish you really got to see Bryan, and I hate that it took away from him.”  And, for the record, Peter and Rachel do not talk. “For me, the reason there was so much emotion [in the finale] was because that was closure for me, that was it,” Rachel told Us Weekly. “And I really haven’t talked to him because I don’t have anything else to say. From what I hear, he’s doing well too.”  Peter is doing well, and you know what? Rachel and Bryan are, too! The pair is still together, living in Dallas (Bryan relocated from Miami) and being just a regular, everyday Bachelor Nation couple. (They also still have Copper, Rachel’s dog, which is very important.)  The number-one question that a Bachelor couple gets after getting engaged on national television is, “When are you getting married?” At least Rachel and Bryan have an answer. As Bryan told ExtraTV, “We haven’t set anything yet. We definitely want to get married this year, and that’s the plan. 2018, it’s gonna happen.” He explained that even though Rachel “isn’t much of a planner,” the nuptials would happen soon, and they may even be on television. “We would definitely be open to a televised wedding. We, right now, we enjoy showing everybody how in love we are... and I think that would be the culmination of our love story, or the beginning of it,” Bryan said. “I think we would definitely enjoy doing it on national television.”  I would also enjoy have a huge wedding paid for by ABC, so why not? In another interview with Us Weekly, Rachel said she needed a few things of the pair’s impending nuptials. “Good music. I’m very big on ‘I want everyone to have a good time and enjoy themselves.’ I know it’s like our day, but it’s about the people we love celebrating our day with us,” she said. “And I really want good flowers. I feel like flowers add character to the wedding, so that’s a must-have. No roses. We’re done. Those days are over.”  No roses is probably a good idea — she could go into muscle memory and just start handing them out. No matter if you were #TeamBryan or #TeamPeter going into Rachel’s finale, there’s no doubt — she and Bryan are still in love, and they don’t care who knows it.",0,en,0,"With new Bachelorette Becca Kufrin waiting in the wings to find her true love, former Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay is out of the spotlight — that’s probably just how she wants it.

[The breakup with Peter] really did overshadow, I felt, a happy moment for us, like one of the best moments of my life,” Rachel told Us Weekly. “I’ve never been engaged before and neither has Bryan, and I felt like we were more on the defense about our relationship and having to explain more of it than rather it just showing … So I just wish you really got to see Bryan, and I hate that it took away from him.”  And, for the record, Peter and Rachel do not talk. “For me, the reason there was so much emotion [in the finale] was because that was closure for me, that was it,” Rachel told Us Weekly. “And I really haven’t talked to him because I don’t have anything else to say. From what I hear, he’s doing well too.”  Peter is doing well, and you know what? Rachel and Bryan are, too! The pair is still together, living in Dallas (Bryan relocated from Miami) and being just a regular, everyday Bachelor Nation couple. (They also still have Copper, Rachel’s dog, which is very important.)  The number-one question that a Bachelor couple gets after getting engaged on national television is, “When are you getting married?” At least Rachel and Bryan have an answer. As Bryan told ExtraTV, “We haven’t set anything yet. We definitely want to get married this year, and that’s the plan. 2018, it’s gonna happen.” He explained that even though Rachel “isn’t much of a planner,” the nuptials would happen soon, and they may even be on television. “We would definitely be open to a televised wedding. We, right now, we enjoy showing everybody how in love we are... and I think that would be the culmination of our love story, or the beginning of it,” Bryan said. “I think we would definitely enjoy doing it on national television.”  I would also enjoy have a huge wedding paid for by ABC, so why not? In another interview with Us Weekly, Rachel said she needed a few things of the pair’s impending nuptials. “Good music. I’m very big on ‘I want everyone to have a good time and enjoy themselves.’ I know it’s like our day, but it’s about the people we love celebrating our day with us,” she said. “And I really want good flowers. I feel like flowers add character to the wedding, so that’s a must-have. No roses. We’re done. Those days are over.”  No roses is probably a good idea — she could go into muscle memory and just start handing them out. No matter if you were #TeamBryan or #TeamPeter going into Rachel’s finale, there’s no doubt — she and Bryan are still in love, and they don’t care who knows it."
gossipcop-884410,"“Vegas is a funny town,” said Jimmy Kimmel during his emotional opening monologue for Jimmy Kimmel Live on Monday night. “It’s easy to forget people live there.”  The late-night host would know: Kimmel is a Vegas native himself, having moved there from Brooklyn when he was 9. So when he launched into his introduction to Monday night’s show, just one day after a shooter, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock of Mesquite, Nevada, opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers outside Las Vegas’s Mandalay Bay Hotel, the news was particularly poignant. James Corden, Trevor Noah , Stephen Colbert , and Seth Meyers all, like Kimmel, devoted their opening monologues to discussing the shooting in Las Vegas.  But Kimmel, who has recently found a calling transforming his show into a political conscience (even though, as he said Monday night, “I want this to be a comedy show. I hate talking about stuff like this”), began tearing up as soon as the cameras started rolling, giving a particularly unfiltered perspective on gun control and the government’s continuing inaction in the face of mass shootings.  “It’s the kind of thing that makes you want to throw up or give up,” he said. “It’s too much to process.” He offered a scathing indictment of both the president, who offered his “warmest condolences” on Twitter while having signed a bill in February that allowed mentally ill individuals easier access to purchasing guns, as well as of the 56 senators who voted against closing a loophole that allows prospective gun buyers to evade the government-mandated background checks, showing their faces on screen and describing them as those “who won’t do anything about this because the NRA has their balls in a money clip.” For in the wake of various incidents of gun violence—Sandy Hook, Charleston, Orlando, now Las Vegas—the National Rifle Association has successfully lobbied in favor of second-amendment rights: “Our forefathers wanted us to have AK-47s, is the argument,” Kimmel said, incredulous.  Politicians’ inaction—and their widespread reluctance to turn mass shootings into mobilizing efforts in favor of stricter gun control—was the subject of the monologues of Kimmel’s peers, too. As Corden, whose voice also tightened as he delivered a quiet, measured speech, said, “Some say it’s too early to talk about gun control; for those victims last night, it’s far too late.” He, like Noah, is a recent New York transplant who has witnessed the two worst mass shootings since the mid-20th century in the past two years: First, at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida last summer; and now, in Las Vegas, Nevada.  “It should be hard for everyone to fathom,” Corden said. “Gun violence should not be a staple of American life.”  And yet the response to these shootings—of which there have been 275 so far in 2017—has become rote. “People are becoming more accustomed to this kind of news. I almost know how it’s going to play out,” Noah said during The Daily Show on Monday night, a sentiment Meyers echoed opening Late Night With Seth Meyers . “We’re shocked, we’re sad, thoughts and prayers, and then, almost on cue, people are going to come out and say, whatever you do, when you speak about the shooting, don’t talk about guns,” Meyers said.  It’s not just that politicians have refused to pass gun control legislation that, as Stephen Colbert pointed out, “the vast majority of Americans want.” Later this week, a bill that would make it easier for individuals to purchase gun silencers—which, as Politico reported, currently have more stringent requirements for purchase than guns themselves —was expected to go up for a vote in the House of Representatives. However, Sunday night’s shooting is expected to delay the bill to some degree—for, at least, if elected leaders refuse to “politicize” an incident of gun violence as a way of promoting gun control, the converse is also true, that they will also be reluctant to promote gun (and gun accessory) access.

gossipcop-9811720113,"I, at least, struggle to understand her career. Her performance as a junkie in “The Town” features the “Bride Wars” of Boston accents. Her performance in “The Age of Adaline” — as a woman “cursed” to stay 30 forever — was like watching a mermaid ride a bike. She tries. But her acting hasn’t yet caught up to her algorithm-generated beauty. Alas, there may be no algorithmic solution for that.  So I was less than psyched at the prospect of seeing her shiver on a buoy, stitch her own wounds, talk to animals or play a Nancy. And, as refreshing as it is watching her stand on a surfboard, it’s refreshment that provides some perspective. While some actors make sense on movie screens, there are others who might make better sense on a can of something — beer, beans, air. I can hear you, Hudson skeptics. And all I can say is that the heart wants what the heart wants. I’d actually buy whatever Ms. Hudson was on the can of.  There might be no appreciable industrial difference between what a Kate Hudson can do versus your Blake Livelys.

Channing Tatum, for instance, is a more elastic, hip-hop-era Brendan Fraser upgrade.  Lots of parts that have gone to Ms. Lively feel as if Ms. Hudson could have played them. But something happened, and suddenly it was someone else’s turn to be “it.” (It’s always someone else’s turn.)

Her portrayal of a drug addict in the film ""The Town"" exhibits a perplexing amalgamation of Boston accents akin to the mismatched dynamic in ""Bride Wars."" Similarly, her performance in ""The Age of Adaline,"" where she plays a perpetually young woman cursed with eternal youth, is reminiscent of observing a mermaid effortlessly maneuvering a bicycle. Though she endeavors to excel, her acting prowess has yet to catch up to her algorithmically generated beauty. Unfortunately, it seems that there may not be an algorithmic remedy for this disparity. Consequently, I approached the notion of witnessing her tremble on a buoy, tending to her own injuries, conversing with animals, or assuming the persona of a Nancy with less enthusiasm. Nonetheless, witnessing her poised presence on a surfboard offers a refreshing perspective. While certain actors thrive in the context of motion pictures, there are others whose essence may be more aligned with a product like beer, beans, or even air. I am aware of the skeptics who question Kate Hudson's abilities, yet I believe that personal preferences transcend such concerns. In fact, I would willingly purchase any product endorsed by Ms. Hudson. The industrial disparity between the capabilities of actresses like Kate Hudson and Blake Lively may not be significant. Although I do not view them as interchangeable, there are instances when the film industry contradicts this notion and corrects itself through market forces. One mustn't become too infatuated with Mark Harmon, as Kevin Costner is bound to emerge as the next phenomenon. Similarly, it is wise to divest from Brad Rowe stocks as Brad Pitt emerges as the inevitable replacement. (This shift was quite evident during the late 1990s.) Nonetheless, there are gradients within this continuum. Channing Tatum, for example, represents a versatile, hip-hop-infused upgrade of Brendan Fraser's persona from a bygone era. Many roles typically assigned to Ms. Lively could have been effortlessly portrayed by Ms. Hudson. Yet, circumstances intervened, prompting another actress to take center stage. (It is always someone else's turn.) What frustrates me about the dearth of Kate Hudson's presence and the surfeit of Ms. Lively is akin to the annoyance felt when an otherwise functional software undergoes an unnecessary update, or when an overzealous waiter abruptly removes an unfinished plate at a restaurant: I had not concluded my experience."

gossipcop-6722352082,"Carlotta is a fictional character from Gaston Leroux's 1909 novel The Phantom of the Opera.  In the novel, she is a minor character hailing from Spain. The first time that she is mentioned in the novel is during the chapter ""The New Marguerite"", where it is revealed that she could not perform at the ceremony for the former managers. Later in the novel, she is threatened by Erik that if she performs at the Opera House ""a great misfortune will strike"". She shrugs the warning off and performs anyway. When she does, however, croaking noises come out of her mouth and the chandelier comes crashing down. Ashamed, she hides from the public view for a few weeks, before making a return to the opera house.  Carlotta is portrayed by Virginia Pearson in the original 1925 silent film with Lon Chaney. In 1929, new sound scenes were filmed and Mary Fabian was recast as Carlotta, due to the fact that she could sing. Virginia Pearson still appeared in new scenes, now playing Carlotta's mother. These changes are also the same in the 1929 silent, foreign cut of the film (which is most commonly viewed).  In the 1943 film version, she is Mme. Biancarolli who has been drugged by the Phantom and murdered along with her maid when she tries to force him to take off his prop mask.  In Andrew Lloyd Webber's production, Carlotta (last name Giudicelli) is from Italy and is one of the major singing parts. The opera company's prima donna, she despises Christine Daaé and sees the younger woman as a threat to her job and Phantom´s courtesan, when Christine achieves prominence due to the Phantom's dirty tricks. Carlotta and tenor Ubaldo Piangi are lovers; she often turns to him for consolation when things go wrong, and she breaks down crying when his murdered body is discovered onstage. The film reveals that she likes poodles.  In the Lloyd Webber-Joel Schumacher 2004 film version, she was played by Minnie Driver.[1] Due to Driver's lack of experience in opera, her singing voice was dubbed by opera singer Margaret Preece, although she lent her actual voice to the song ""Learn to Be Lonely"" during the end credits.  In Nicholas Meyer's novel The Canary Trainer, the characters of Carlotta and La Sorelli are combined into one, despite being mentioned as separate characters in the original novel. In Kim Newman's short story ""Angels of Music"" from the Tales of the Shadowmen anthology series, Carlotta is implied to be the ancestor of Bianca Castafiore from The Adventures of Tintin comic series.",1,en,"Carlotta is a fictional character from Gaston Leroux's 1909 novel The Phantom of the Opera.

In Kim Newman's short story ""Angels of Music"" from the Tales of the Shadowmen anthology series, Carlotta is implied to be the ancestor of Bianca Castafiore from The Adventures of Tintin comic series.","Carlotta, a character brought to life by Gaston Leroux in his renowned 1909 novel The Phantom of the Opera, holds a significant yet brief presence on the pages. Hailing from Spain, she is introduced in the chapter titled ""The New Marguerite"", where it is disclosed that she had been unable to partake in the ceremony for the former managers. As the narrative unfolds, she finds herself confronted by Erik, who warns her of dire consequences should she dare perform at the Opera House. Undeterred, she dismisses the threat, only to face a humiliating ordeal during her performance. To her dismay, raucous sounds escape her vocal cords while the chandelier crashes down upon the stage. Consumed by shame, she withdraws from the public eye for several weeks before finally reclaiming her place at the opera house.

In the original 1925 silent film adaptation of Leroux's masterpiece, Carlotta is portrayed by Virginia Pearson, sharing the screen with the legendary Lon Chaney. Subsequently, in 1929, sound scenes were incorporated, leading to the recasting of Mary Fabian as Carlotta due to her singing abilities. However, Virginia Pearson remained, now assuming the role of Carlotta's mother. These alterations persisted in the 1929 silent, foreign version of the film, which is the most widely viewed rendition.

Fast forward to the 1943 film adaptation, where Carlotta takes on a new identity as Mme. Biancarolli. Entrapped and drugged by the Phantom, Mme. Biancarolli meets a harrowing end, along with her loyal maid, when she imprudently attempts to unveil the Phantom's concealed countenance.

In Andrew Lloyd Webber's illustrious stage production, Carlotta, now bearing the surname Giudicelli, hails from Italy and commands a prominent singing role. As the prima donna of the opera company, she harbors a vehement animosity towards Christine Daaé, perceiving her as a formidable rivalry jeopardizing her position. Moreover, Carlotta becomes entangled in the Phantom's deceptive machinations, eventually succumbing to her tears upon the heart-wrenching discovery of her lover, tenor Ubaldo Piangi, murdered on stage. An intriguing revelation from the film adaptation exposes her affinity for poodles.

In the 2004 film version helmed by Lloyd Webber and Joel Schumacher, the role of Carlotta is brought to life by Minnie Driver. Due to Driver's limited experience in opera, her singing voice is skillfully dubbed by opera singer Margaret Preece, while Driver herself lends her authentic voice to the captivating song ""Learn to Be Lonely"" featured in the end credits.

Lastly, Nicholas Meyer's novel The Canary Trainer presents a unique amalgamation of characters, merging Carlotta and La Sorelli into one, despite their individual mentions in the original novel. Even more intriguingly, Kim Newman's short story ""Angels of Music"" from the Tales of the Shadowmen anthology series hints at Carlotta being the ancestral connection to Bianca Castafiore of The Adventures of Tintin comic series."
gossipcop-178000221,"Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.

While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as “the Kate Effect,” ","Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, did not always hold royal status. However, even prior to her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton possessed a noteworthy net worth. Middleton enjoyed a comfortable upbringing and became the first commoner to wed into the royal family in 2011. Following her marriage, Middleton's net worth experienced significant growth. Here is a comprehensive overview of Middleton's financial standing:

What is the net worth of Kate Middleton? According to Wealth-X, a global wealth-tracking firm, the 36-year-old mother of three, who recently gave birth to a second baby boy in April, is valued at a minimum of £5 million or $7 million. However, alternative estimates place her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. It is important to note that the majority of Middleton's wealth exists in liquid assets, as she does not possess a personal real estate or art portfolio.

That being said, it is important to acknowledge that Middleton's net worth is significantly lower than that of her husband, Prince William. Wealth-X estimates Prince William's net worth to be at least $30 million, although some reports speculate that his fortune may reach closer to $40 million. Out of this total, $19 million is attributed to liquid assets. Wealth-X also highlights the fact that Prince William possesses a high-value helicopter, the Augusta A109S Grand, which is valued at $11 million.

What do we know about Kate Middleton's sources of income? The majority of Middleton's net worth originates from her parents' online party supplies business, Party Pieces. This company is estimated to hold a valuation of around £30 million, or $50 million, largely due to the exposure it receives through its association with the royal family. Prior to her marriage, Middleton was employed by the family business and worked as a part-time accessories buyer for the retailer Jigsaw. Additionally, Middleton and her siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, received an expensive private education, with tuition fees for a single child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000.

Kate Middleton entered into a marriage that provided her access to a tremendous fortune amassed over generations. As the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, they now reside in a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace. Prior to this, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the affluent Chelsea neighborhood of London, which is believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.

After officially becoming a member of the royal family, Kate's personal expenses decreased significantly. The majority of her living costs are covered by the private estate managed by Prince Charles, known as the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue generated by the Duchy of Cornwall assumes most of the financial responsibility for Prince Charles and his immediate family, including official travel expenses, wardrobe costs, housing, and staff salaries. Similarly, when Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry, it is anticipated that the Duchy of Cornwall will also bear the majority of her living costs associated with her royal duties. Markle's estimated net worth is deemed to be around $5 million.

What is the impact of the 'Kate effect'? As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate has become a global fashion icon, with her style choices influencing trends worldwide. While she does not personally profit from the economic activity generated by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has sparked a phenomenon known as ""the Kate Effect."""

Furthermore, Jenner recounted a request made in her will: to be dressed as a woman during her burial, as it aligns with her true self. Despite her political affiliation as a Republican, Jenner expressed disappointment when President Trump's administration revoked guidelines that enabled public school students to use restrooms corresponding to their gender identity. Believing that such matters should be determined by state and local authorities, Jenner vowed to take a stand against any infringement on the rights and equality of her community. Although Jenner has undergone various cosmetic procedures such as changes to her jawline, forehead, and breasts, she asserts that her gender has always been female. She maintains a good relationship with her ex-wife Kris Jenner and stays in touch with her children while respecting their individual pursuits. Jenner revealed that she has not embarked on dating since coming out as transgender two years ago and does not anticipate doing so in the future. Instead, Jenner dedicates her efforts to assisting the transgender community through charitable endeavors and raising awareness about discrimination and related issues. She is determined to advocate for their rights.

gossipcop-938696,"Called out! Chrissy Teigen shaded President Donald Trump after a judge ruled that it’s unconstitutional for him to block Twitter users.  The commander in chief, 71, made headlines in July 2017 for blocking the former model, 32, on the social media platform after years of her trolling his feed. Teigen teased Trump again on Wednesday, May 23, by sharing a video of herself watching an MSNBC report detailing the ruling.  “Well well well we meet again @realDonaldTrump,” the cookbook author captioned the clip.  Teigen hasn’t shied away from voicing her disdain for the real estate magnate. Back in January, she hilariously Snapchatted herself hosting Trump’s “Most Dishonest & Corrupt Media Awards of the Year,” which she jokingly promised to host earlier that month.  Last June, the Lip Sync Battle host told the Celebrity Apprentice alum to “grow the f—k up” after he bashed a New York Times story about his stance on the Senate health bill.  But she didn’t stop there. Earlier that year, Teigen slammed Trump’s views on immigration after he tweeted, “We must keep ‘evil’ out of this country.” She wasted no time before snapping back, “What time should we call your uber?”  The Sports Illustrated stunner opened up about her feud with the hotel mogul during a February 2017 interview with USA Today. “I’ve been [trolling him] forever and I take pride in that.

The singer is looking out for her girl, Khloe Kardashian, and wants her to know she’s risking ‘serious heartbreak’ trusting Tristan Thompson with his ex. Read on for all the EXCLUSIVE details.  Iggy Azalea, 26, knows a lot about heartbreak when it comes to dealing with men. Especially, those who are still connected to their exes.

The singer is expressing concern for her friend Khloe Kardashian and wants to make her aware of the potential for heartbreak by trusting Tristan Thompson, who has a past with his ex. 

Having experienced her fair share of heartbreak with men who maintain connections with their previous partners, Iggy Azalea, 26, is reaching out to Khloe Kardashian, 32, to warn her about the possibility of getting her heartbroken by Tristan Thompson, 25, if she's not cautious. 

According to a source close to Iggy, she has contacted French Montana to ensure Khloe is aware of the risks involved with Tristan. Iggy explained to French that basketball players like Tristan can be ruthless and indifferent to the hearts they break, as they pursue relationships with every available woman. 

The source continued, revealing that Iggy still carries emotional pain from Nick Young's infidelity and subsequent fathering of a child with his previous partner. Adhering to the principles of loyalty among women, Iggy does not want Khloe to endure the same kind of anguish, and she hopes that French can reach her before it is too late. 

As previously reported by HollywoodLife.com, Khloe struggles to ignore the rumors linking Tristan to his baby mama, Jordy Craig. In response to these allegations, Khloe has hired private investigators to monitor Tristan's activities. Although she believes in Tristan's love and commitment, Khloe cannot help but worry at times. She has made it a priority to be present in Cleveland as much as possible and has informants in every city where Tristan's team plays. 

Do you think Khloe will take Iggy's advice into consideration?"

gossipcop-845755,"It’s rare to find me without my curls smoothed, twisted by a curling iron into beach waves , and misted with texture spray. I love to have my hair done. A trip to the local blow-dry bar is my favorite Saturday afternoon pastime. However, at $50 a session, getting this look done by professionals on the regular is costly. So I’ve perfected my own blowout skills. It may seem like an easy task: grab a blow-dryer, point, and blast with heat. But there is a mastery behind it. And you may be making simple mistakes that are actually hurting your hair even more than your look. Here, top pros break down the science to getting a gorgeous at-home blowout every single time and point out all the rookie mistakes that keep them in business. 1. You don’t have a great blow-dryer. Let’s start at the very beginning: Investing in a high-quality tool is important, especially if you have a lot of hair or you’re blow-drying your hair often. “If you have thick hair, you’re probably damaging your hair more with a cheap blow-dryer as opposed to investing in a great one that will protect your hair and blow-dry it quicker,” Kérastase celebrity stylist Jennifer Yepez tells SELF. Expensive dryers tend to come with hair-saving smart features like high power, multiple heat settings, a cool shot, and ionic air technology. The last one helps with frizz, creates shine, and minimizes blow-dry time. “The technology in ionic hair dryers helps break down water molecules faster, which makes the hair dry faster,” she adds. The less time your hair is under heat and the more control you have over the temperature, the healthier it will be. Yepez’s favorites are the new T3 Cura Luxe ($250) and the Dyson Supersonic ($399). Expensive? Yes, but you’ll pay for it in what you save skipping just five to 10 blowouts at the salon—and they’ll last you years. 2. You’re spending too long with your hair wrapped in a towel. “After getting out of the shower, women tend to leave their hair in the towel for like 30 minutes,” says Giovanni Vaccaro, Glasmsquad’s creative director. “A cotton-based towel causes friction on the hair, and it's more prone to damaging the strands to the point where the hair breaks off,” he explains. If you want to get rid of excess water, Vaccaro recommends using a microfiber towel like the Aquis or an old, clean t-shirt. And still, only spend about 10 minutes with your head wrapped up post-shampoo. The best thing for your hair’s health is actually letting it air-dry before blow-drying. “Hair is in its most vulnerable state when wet, so allowing it to air-dry is always the healthiest option,” explains Vaccaro. Make sure to dry your hair according to your texture. Vaccaro says that fine-to-medium hair can air-dry a bit longer, to about 80 percent dryness, whereas thicker hair should only be about 50 percent dry before blow-drying. That’s because you have a better chance of getting curly or full hair straight while it’s still a little damp. If you have curly or wavy hair and want to enhance your natural texture, add product when it’s very wet, squeeze out the excess with your hands, and wrap it up gently in a microfiber towel or t-shirt. Once your curls stop dripping, you can start blow-drying. 3. You start in with the brush too soon. On the opposite side of the 30-minute towel turban faux paus is taking a round brush to sopping wet hair. It’s bad form to immediately walk out of the shower and pick up your blow-dryer and round brush for a blowout. T3 celebrity stylist David Lopez suggests using a dryer to rough dry hair first. Set it to medium heat and low speed. “If hair is very wet and put on high speed, then it gets whipped around a lot,” he says. “This can cause split ends, tangles, and frizz.” Once hair is about 80 percent dry from the rough dry, then you can start sectioning it, molding it, and styling it with a round brush. 4.

You forget to spray heat protectant on the back of your head. Using the right product pre-blowout is going to save your ends from breakage and make your blowout last longer. But make sure you’re applying it correctly. “When some people use a serum for frizzy hair or a thickening spray for volume, they just spray the top of their hair, instead of all around,” says Yepez. “Sometimes you just forget the back of your hair.” She advises parting the hair, creating sections, and working the product from mid-shaft to ends. You can also comb it through, but Yepez says she’s often in a hurry and just uses her fingers. 5. You ignore the concentrator nozzle attachment. You know that flat, nozzle thing that attaches to the end of your hair dryer? Don’t lose it! That little nozzle helps concentrate the air in a more precise way and protect hair from excess heat, which is better for hair health and styling. “A nozzle is a must for a smooth finish!” Vaccaro adds. “The nozzle provides distance between the hair and the lip of the dryer, which is the hottest point. Additionally, the nozzle keeps the air flow concentrated, and without it, the hot air disperses, causing undesirable frizz.” Even if you’re not going for a sleek style, it is important to attach the nozzle—no matter how lazy you feel. “If you're just a ‘rough dry and go’ girl, you should still utilize the smoothing capabilities of the concentrator,” Lopez says. “It helps streamline the airflow leading to less tangles and split ends.” That means fewer haircuts, ladies.

gossipcop-892144,"Actress Kristina Cohen claims the sexual assault occurred in February 2014.  Actress Kristina Cohen has accused Gossip Girl actor Ed Westwick of rape. The television star has denied the claim, saying that he does not know the accuser.  Cohen — who posted the claim on Facebook with details of her emotional state over the past month during the flood of sexual misconduct stories in Hollywood (she called the outpouring ""both triggering and emotionally exhausting"") — alleges that Westwick sexually assaulted her three years ago, in February 2014, during ""a dark time in my life."" Her mother was sick with cancer (she died three months after the alleged assault) and she did not have the support system to deal with ""the aftermath of the rape.""  Reached by The Hollywood Reporter on Monday night, Cohen detailed the claims she made in her Facebook post. Her sister, Catalina Colgate, and close friend, Blaise Godbe Lipman, separately corroborated that they were told of Cohen's account three years ago, when the sexual assault was alleged to have taken place.  Westwick responded in a statement on Instagram that read, ""I do not know this woman. I have never forced myself in any manner, on any woman. I certainly have never committed rape.""  The incident allegedly occurred at Westwick's home in the Hollywood Hills. Cohen said she had been invited to the actor's home by a producer named Kaine Harling, a man she had briefly dated in 2013. The evening took a turn, she claims, when ""Ed suggested 'we should all fuck.'"" Despite wanting to leave, Cohen said she was encouraged to stay for another 20 minutes by Harling ""to smooth everything over"" while Westwick suggested she nap in a guest bedroom.  After falling asleep, Cohen alleges that she woke up to Westwick assaulting her.  ""I was woken up abruptly by Ed on top of me, his fingers entering my body. I told him to stop, but he was strong. I fought him off as hard as I could but he grabbed my face in his hands, shaking me, telling me he wanted to fuck me,"" Cohen alleges. ""I was paralyzed, terrified. I couldn’t speak, I could no longer move. He held me down and raped me.""  Shocked and confused, Cohen said she ended up leaving the next morning. ""I was so lost and needed someone to pull me out of there,"" she told THR, adding that Harling had left earlier in the night.  Cohen told her friend Lipman of the encounter and also spoke with Harling, whom she claims blamed her for what happened. She added that Harling told her ""I can’t say anything because Ed will have people come after me, destroy me, and that I could forget about an acting career. Saying there’s no way I can go around saying Ed 'raped' me and that I don’t want to be 'that girl.'""  Cohen continued that she now realizes ""the ways in which these men in power prey on women, and how this tactic is used so frequently in our industry, and surely, in many others."" THR reached out to Harling for comment, but he has yet to respond.  Seeing the flood of stories about everyone from Harvey Weinstein and James Toback to Kevin Spacey and Brett Ratner inspired Cohen to share her story of the alleged incident. Cohen, who is from Atlanta, is an actress, writer and producer whose credits include the series Ladies Like Us and the upcoming film Earthwalkers.  ""There is a bigger picture to this — cleaning out the system and creating radical change,"" Cohen told THR. ""I think that's what I'm contributing to.

We’ve got the pics of their steamy Mexican getaway  Rihanna has kept her one year romance with Saudi billionaire Hassan Jameel super private. So when rumors surfaced in June that they had broken up fans were waiting to see proof they were still a couple. They got it on July 9 when pics surfaced of the 30-year-old singer and the businessman on a sexy Mexican getaway. The two appeared to be locked in a animated conversation as bikini clad RiRi is seen pointing her right index finger in the air with her mouth open, looking like she had something important to say. In another pic Hassan is seen looking back at her with his hand on his chest as if they’re involved in a somewhat heated conversation. CLICK HERE to see all the pics.  On June 1 MediaTakeOut claimed RiRi had dumped Hassan. The site reported that “Rihanna just got tired of him. She gets tired of men sometimes,” an alleged insider told them. They said that the handsome billionaire wasn’t doing too well after the split. “Of course Rihanna broke his heart. That’s what she does — break men’s hearts.” Since Rihanna has never commented on her romance with Hassan and goes to great lengths to keep their relationship away from the public eye, MTO’s report spread like wildfire.  Obviously something is still on between Rihanna and Hassan, as they are having a hot summer together. They were first photographed a year ago making out in a pool in Spain. They’ve only been pictured a handful of times since, keeping their love undercover. The “Work” singer’s previous relationship was with Drake, 31, and it played out in public. He even professed his years of love to her in front of the world while presenting her with the Video Vanguard award at the 2016 VMAs. After having the public know all about their dating business, Ri has wisely kept her romance with Hassan as far out of the public eye as possible.  Rihanna revealed recently that Drake gushing about her on live TV made her cringe. In a May 2018 interview with Vogue, she said “Waiting through that speech was probably the most uncomfortable part. I don’t like too many compliments; I don’t like to be put on blast.” As for where she stands with Drizzy, she told the mag that they haven’t spoken and that “We don’t have a friendship now, but we’re not enemies either. It is what it is.” However she did come the close to discussing her relationship with Hassan, telling the publication that she dating and she is happy. “I used to feel guilty about taking personal time,” she revealed, “but I also think I never met someone who was worth it before,” she said about her romance with Hassan.",1,en,"Despite rumors of a split, Rihanna is still very much together with boyfriend of one year Hassan Jameel.

The couple, who have been together for a year, have kept their love affair extremely private. This led to speculation in June that they had split, leaving fans eagerly awaiting proof of their continued togetherness. On July 9, such evidence emerged with pictures from their intimate getaway in Mexico.

In these photographs, the 30-year-old singer and the Saudi billionaire showcase their deep connection. Rihanna can be seen animatedly pointing her right index finger in the air while engaged in what appears to be a meaningful conversation. Hassan reciprocates this intensity, looking back at her with his hand on his chest, clearly engaged in a passionate discussion. The images speak volumes about the strength of their bond.

It is worth noting that earlier this year, Rihanna's previous relationship with Drake played out very publicly. The contrast is stark with her current romance, as she has gone to great lengths to keep her love with Hassan away from the prying eyes of the media. This commitment to privacy has only fueled speculation and rumors, exemplified by MediaTakeOut's claim that the couple had separated. Despite such rumors, it is evident that Rihanna and Hassan are enjoying a scorching summer together, relishing the privacy they have deliberately cultivated.

In a recent interview with Vogue, Rihanna admitted feeling uncomfortable when Drake publically expressed his love for her, stating that she doesn't appreciate excessive compliments and being put in the spotlight. Regarding her current relationship, she revealed that she is dating and happy, suggesting that her romance with Hassan is a significant departure from her previous experiences. In her words, she disclosed, ""I used to feel guilty about taking personal time, but I also think I never met someone who was worth it before."" This statement is a powerful testament to the depth of her relationship with Hassan.

In conclusion, Rihanna and Hassan Jameel's relationship not only endures but flourishes. Their commitment to privacy showcases a level of maturity and understanding that is often absent in the world of celebrity relationships. As they continue to support and cherish each other, it is clear that their love remains strong and steadfast."
gossipcop-6909849467,"Now, it’s official: Star Wars fans will have one final chance to say goodbye to Carrie Fisher, with Lucasfilm announcing that the actress, who died in December 2016, will appear in next year’s Star Wars: Episode IX.  In a statement, director J.J. Abrams sought to put concerns about potential CGI resurrections to rest, saying that the new movie will use “unseen footage we shot together in Episode VII” and assuring fans that “we were never going to recast, or use a CG character.” While this is, undoubtedly, comforting, it would also appear to offer particular clues about the role Fisher — or, more specifically, her character, Leia Organa — will play in the movie.  Firstly: Purely for practical purposes, Leia’s presence in the movie will be small. If nothing else, there can’t be that much extraneous, unseen footage from 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens; she was barely in that movie, so unless large swaths of scenes were shot but never even hinted at by anyone involved in the production, there’s limited material to draw from in the first place, and surely not everything available will be used.  Considering the context of the footage, it also limits the potential use for Episode IX. Leia appeared in few scenes and locations in The Force Awakens. Leia was on Takodana, rescuing Han, Chewbacca, Rey and Finn, and then at the Resistance base on D’Qar, where she takes part in planning, and later monitoring, the attack on Starkiller Base. Aside from brief interludes with Han and, later, Rey, she’s very much in “harried leader” mode throughout the movie. Does this mean that this is the Leia we’ll see in Episode IX, even after losing her ex-husband, and then her brother, in the previous two movies?  (It’s possible that the Fisher footage will end up being just a minor flashback, used to punctuate a contemporary moment; memories during her funeral, as some on social media have already suggested. If so, then the above problem is side-stepped, to a degree.)  Abrams’ comments leave space for some level of postproduction trickery to be applied to the Fisher footage. Presumably, Fisher will be intercut with new footage of actors shot specifically for Episode IX. Will digital trickery be used to make sure that Fisher shares a location with the other cast members? If so, will that be all that’s altered? What about costuming choices? For that matter, what about the potential for posthumous dubbing or soundalikes used for dialogue where Leia is off-camera or not in close-up? Abrams said that the movie would never use a CG character, but what about a performance augmented or altered by CG?  Of course, if any such edits or alterations are made, they’ll have to be done with subtlety and sensitivity. This is key to the entire enterprise of including footage of Fisher posthumously. For as much as fans want to be able to say goodbye to the actress, and also to Leia, they want to do so in a manner that feels appropriate and respectful to both. While Abrams and Lucasfilm — and Fisher’s family, especially daughter Billie Lourd, named in Abrams’ statement — want to provide both closure and tribute to Leia and Fisher alike with this move, they’re courting backlash if this isn’t done perfectly.  That the footage will come from The Force Awakens feels particularly fitting, then; that, after all, was a project that already came with expectations and looming accusations from fandom expecting the worst. It’s also perhaps a reminder that those involved with this move love the mythology — and loved Fisher as a person — as much as anyone else, if not more so, and will be approaching it with the utmost care.

Everyone will, inevitably, remain worried until the final product appears onscreen, but perhaps we can rest just slightly in the meantime.","In an official announcement, Lucasfilm has confirmed that Star Wars fans will be given a final opportunity to bid farewell to the late Carrie Fisher in next year’s Star Wars: Episode IX. Director J.J. Abrams sought to allay concerns about the use of CGI technology, assuring fans that the film will incorporate unused footage that was originally captured during Episode VII. Abrams emphasized that there will be no recasting or reliance on computer-generated characters. While this news is undeniably reassuring, it also provides some insights into the extent of Fisher's appearance in the movie, specifically as her character, Leia Organa. 

It is important to note that due to practical limitations, Leia's presence in Episode IX will be minimal. Considering that there is unlikely to be a surplus of unused footage from Star Wars: The Force Awakens in 2015, as Fisher had limited screen time in that film, it is safe to assume that only a fraction of the available material will be utilized. This constraint raises questions regarding the role Leia will play in the upcoming film. In The Force Awakens, Leia was primarily portrayed as a determined leader, with her scenes centered on the rescue mission and battle preparation at various locations. Given the events of the previous two movies, losing her ex-husband and brother, will Leia still embody this role in Episode IX? 

One plausible speculation circulating on social media is that the Fisher footage may be utilized as brief flashbacks during significant moments or even in a memorial context. This approach could alleviate the challenge mentioned earlier. However, it is worth noting that Abrams' remarks suggest the possibility of utilizing post-production techniques to seamlessly integrate the Fisher footage with new scenes featuring the cast. This raises further questions: Will digital manipulations harmonize Fisher's presence with her co-stars? Will costuming choices present any challenges? And could posthumous dubbing or voice doubles be employed to depict dialogue in scenes where Leia is not on-screen or in close-up shots? Although Abrams has pledged not to employ a CG character, utilizing CG to enhance or modify Fisher's performance remains a potential consideration. 

Of course, any modifications made to the footage will need to be executed delicately and with the utmost sensitivity. Achieving this balance is crucial to the entire endeavor of including Fisher's posthumous presence in the film. Fans want to bid farewell to both the actress and the character she portrayed, and it is imperative that this is done in a manner that is fitting and respectful. Abrams, Lucasfilm, and Fisher's family, particularly her daughter Billie Lourd, who was mentioned in Abrams' statement, are determined to offer closure and pay tribute to both Leia and Fisher. Nonetheless, any missteps in the execution of these intentions could lead to backlash and disappointment. 

Given the source of the footage from The Force Awakens, it is poignant that this project, like its predecessor, carries high expectations and potential skepticism from the fandom. This also serves as a reminder that those involved in this endeavor share the deep appreciation for the Star Wars mythology and held Fisher in high regard, perhaps even more so than the fans themselves. Rest assured, the utmost care will be taken to handle this delicate situation. 

While concerns will inevitably persist until the final product is unveiled onscreen, we can, for now, find some solace in knowing that every effort will be made to execute this tribute flawlessly."

gossipcop-851896,"It’s easy to get lost in the swell of superhero entertainment. Justice League and Thor: Ragnarok both come out next month. The new trailer for Black Panther just dropped last week. A slew of superhero television shows, including The Defenders, The Tick, Inhumans, Runaways, and The Punisher, have recently debuted or are set to debut later this year, joining the ranks of existing series like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Legion, Arrow, Supergirl, The Flash, and Marvel’s ever-growing stable of Netflix series. The thought of adding another entry to such a crowded docket feels more like a taunt than a treat. But somehow, despite the ongoing deluge of capes and cowls, one new series this fall is poised to make you want more superhero shows just like it. It’s The Gifted, which debuted earlier this month on Fox. The show — a drama set in the X-Men’s mutant universe where the X-Men might not exist and anti-mutant sentiment is high— is an on-the-run thriller with a big, bad government that wants to hunt down these special humans. Each episode of the show’s young first season (three episodes have aired so far) has been equal parts mutant melodrama and family soap opera, with savvy and relatively impressive special effects. (Television superhero shows aren’t exactly well-known for their dazzle.) But the best thing about the show is how well it translates and stays true to the heart of the X-Men. The Gifted, like all the best X-Men stories, understands that the X-Men aren’t celebrity superheroes The Gifted’s premise is divided into two main plots. The first plot involves a ragtag group of mutants on the run from the government. John Proudstar, a.k.a. Thunderbird (Blair Redford), is a mutant with superhuman agility and strength with superhuman senses. He leads a group whose core members include teleporter Clarice Fong, a.k.a.

These two stories collide when Kate and Andy experience their mutant awakenings in the show’s first episode and seek help from Thunderbird’s mutant underground railroad. The twist is that their father, Reed, works a prosecutor who specializes in jailing mutants, making a living by detailing the threats that mutants present to society. And he had no idea his children were mutants. In each episode, there’s tension not just between mutants and the various members of the Strucker family, but also with Reed’s conscience and whether he’ll turn on the people helping his family, in order to cut a deal with the government in hopes it’ll spare his family. Since the X-Men aren’t present in this world, in the public’s eye, all mutants, even if they’re not displaying mutant powers, are dangerous.

Justice League and Thor: Ragnarok both come out next month. The new trailer for Black Panther just dropped last week. A slew of superhero television shows, including The Defenders, The Tick, Inhumans, Runaways, and The Punisher, have recently debuted or are set to debut later this year, joining the ranks of existing series like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Legion, Arrow, Supergirl, The Flash, and Marvel’s ever-growing stable of Netflix series. The thought of adding another entry to such a crowded docket feels more like a taunt than a treat. But somehow, despite the ongoing deluge of capes and cowls, one new series this fall is poised to make you want more superhero shows just like it. It’s The Gifted, which debuted earlier this month on Fox. The show — a drama set in the X-Men’s mutant universe where the X-Men might not exist and anti-mutant sentiment is high— is an on-the-run thriller with a big, bad government that wants to hunt down these special humans. Each episode of the show’s young first season (three episodes have aired so far) has been equal parts mutant melodrama and family soap opera, with savvy and relatively impressive special effects. (Television superhero shows aren’t exactly well-known for their dazzle.) But the best thing about the show is how well it translates and stays true to the heart of the X-Men. The Gifted, like all the best X-Men stories, understands that the X-Men aren’t celebrity superheroes The Gifted’s premise is divided into two main plots. The first plot involves a ragtag group of mutants on the run from the government. John Proudstar, a.k.a. Thunderbird (Blair Redford), is a mutant with superhuman agility and strength with superhuman senses. He leads a group whose core members include teleporter Clarice Fong, a.k.a. Blink (Jamie Chung); mistress of magnetism Lorna Dane, a.k.a. Polaris (Emma Dumont); and photon-manipulating Marcos Diaz a.k.a. Eclipse (Sean Teale). The team’s main objective is to house and protect mutants who are on the run. The second plot centers on the Strucker family, an initially normal-seeming bunch headed up by dad Reed (Stephen Moyer) and mom Caitlin (Kate) (Amy Acker). However, the Struckers’ lives become anything but ordinary when siblings Lauren (Natalie Alyn Lind) and Andy (Percy Hynes White) find out they’re mutants. These two stories collide when Kate and Andy experience their mutant awakenings in the show’s first episode and seek help from Thunderbird’s mutant underground railroad. The twist is that their father, Reed, works a prosecutor who specializes in jailing mutants, making a living by detailing the threats that mutants present to society. And he had no idea his children were mutants. In each episode, there’s tension not just between mutants and the various members of the Strucker family, but also with Reed’s conscience and whether he’ll turn on the people helping his family, in order to cut a deal with the government in hopes it’ll spare his family. Since the X-Men aren’t present in this world, in the public’s eye, all mutants, even if they’re not displaying mutant powers, are dangerous. And this bleak view of humanity and its warts are what makes The Gifted’s premise such a strong addition to the X-Men universe. Thunderbird’s team knows just how bad humans can be. The Strucker family is just learning. And the show becomes a push and pull between two ideologies, with the Struckers slowly realizing what it’s like to be outsiders. Last year, I had the opportunity to speak to Chris Claremont, a comic book writer who, with artists John Byrne and Dave Cockrum, is considered to be part of the team that breathed new life into the X-Men in the ’70s and ’80s and turned them into the pop culture force they are today. Claremont told me that what was most crucial to the X-Men was the idea that they were outsiders. “The one core difference that made the X-universe unique, compared to the Avengers and the Fantastic Four and all of the rest of the Marvel universe, is that they were totally clandestine. People were scared because they weren't a public team,” Claremont said. “They were a shadow team. There were only a few of them, comparatively speaking. If you take that away, then they are no different than any other team.” This idea is key to The Gifted. The reason it feels so different from many other superhero shows stems from the role that fear plays in its story; no one is saving the day in one fell swoop. And even though there are acts of heroism — like Thunderbird and Eclipse rescuing the Struckers in the third episode — any small miracles that would otherwise inspire hope and optimism are swallowed up by the relentlessness and influence of a government that’s intent on rounding up and getting rid of mutants. It’s compelling because it’s not a superhero story, but rather a survival story about beings who happen to have superpowers. But the show also smartly tweaks the classic X-Men story by changing its point of view In addition to capturing the fear and loathing of the X-universe, The Gifted incorporates a lot of other classic X-Men elements: Family — both the one you’re born into and the one you choose — is a major theme. So is the question of who helps the helpless. Villains are omnipresent and constantly spying, as the government’s Sentinel program sees and hears almost everything. When you look at major X-Men stories like God Loves, Man Kills or the crossover event known as The Mutant Massacre, they involve the deaths of innocent people who’ve been marginalized by society. In God Loves, Man Kills, two innocent mutant children are slaughtered by religious zealots. In The Mutant Massacre, a group of mutants shunned by society are living in sewers, where a group of villains named the Marauders kill them. It’s up to the X-Men, who themselves are hated by society, to help these marginalized groups. Those"

Come back well rested and a stronger bond and marriage. Yahoo for the Harveys.”  Days earlier, RadarOnline reported that Marjorie walked out on Steve because he had been getting close with Kris Jenner during closed-door business meetings and ongoing phone calls and text messages.  “There was a huge blowout fight and Marjorie walked out threatening divorce,” a source told the gossip site of the reported split. “There’s no way she was going to put up with Steve hanging around a man-eater like Kris — especially since he’s proven time and again he can’t be trusted.”  Although Jenner was reportedly just stringing Steve along to get tips on TV success, one of his former talk show employes said Marjorie knows her man, who is twice divorced and cheated on both wives with the next.  “Steve has a wandering eye and he loves women!” the ex-worker told Radar anonymously. “He’s cheated during his previous marriages, and Marjorie knows he could do it again. She knows her man’s weakness — knows everything about him! That’s why she watches him so closely.”  The rumor was the talk of Twitter.  “Am I late?? Did everyone know Steve Harvey is being accused of cheating on Marjorie with Kris Jenner?! I didn’t know this 😂.”  “Steve Harvey left his wife to marry Marjorie, his side b—- of 20 years, and now she’s leaving him and running his pockets. Hilarious. Karma’s a bad b—-.”  “Boyyy if this Steve Harvey rumor is true… he gon be sick for a minute. He loves him some Marjorie.”","Steve Harvey recently addressed and debunked a rumor that circulated last week, alleging that he and his wife Marjorie Harvey were on the verge of a $400 million divorce. The TV host took to Instagram on Sunday, July 8, to share a photo of himself and his wife boarding a private jet, accompanying it with the caption, ""Vacation time is here, let's go girl."" This image, which resembled one posted by Marjorie on her Instagram Story, received positive feedback from their fans. One fan wished them blessings and encouraged them to stay focused and not lose sight of their vision, while another expressed their excitement for the couple, hoping their vacation would strengthen their bond and marriage. In contrast to these supportive comments, the rumor previously reported by Radar Online claimed that Marjorie had left Steve due to his alleged close relationship with Kris Jenner during undisclosed business meetings and ongoing communication. According to an anonymous source, Marjorie supposedly walked out after a heated argument, stating that she had no intentions of tolerating Steve associating with someone like Kris. This source further alleged that Steve, who has a history of infidelity, had a weakness for women and that Marjorie, being aware of it, closely monitors his actions. The rumor quickly became a topic of discussion on Twitter, with users expressing surprise at the news and sharing their opinions. Despite the speculation, Steve Harvey's recent Instagram post seems to dismiss any truth to the rumors, showcasing a united front between him and his wife as they embark on a well-deserved vacation."

gossipcop-8854037683,"Titanic II is set to launch in less than two years — not in movie theaters, but on the open sea.  A replica of the world’s most famous “unsinkable” ship — which struck an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912, killing 1,503 people — is under construction, with a maiden voyage planned for 2018.  Australian tycoon and politician Clive Palmer — not J. Bruce Ismay — is at the helm of the ambitious project to faithfully recreate the luxury ship, which will be about 13 feet wider to meet current regulations.  More importantly, it will carry enough lifeboats for every passenger and its hull will be welded, not riveted, just in case it comes across a rogue iceberg, the Belfast Telegraph reports.  “The new Titanic will of course have modern evacuation procedures, satellite controls, digital navigation and radar systems and all those things you’d expect on a 21st-century ship,” James McDonald, global marketing director of Palmer’s company, Blue Star Line, told the paper.  The new nine-deck ship will be 885 feet long, about two more than her doomed predecessor, 174 feet high and have a maximum speed of 24 knots. She will accommodate 2,400 passengers — 177 more than the RMS Titanic.  It also will feature the same categories of passengers — from the first-class movers and shakers to the hoi polloi in third class, where poor Leonardo DiCaprio was berthed in the classic movie.  Unlike the Belfast-built original, the Titanic II is under construction by the CSC Jinling Shipyard in Jiangsu, China.  Its maiden voyage will not be from Southampton to New York, but rather from Jiangsu, China, to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, the paper reported.  Some of the dead passengers’ relatives have criticized the plans for a new Titanic, but Blue Star has reportedly been flooded with requests for tickets — with some offering up to about $900,000 for a spot on the first trip.",1,en,"Titanic II is set to launch in less than two years — not in movie theaters, but on the open sea.

Some of the dead passengers’ relatives have criticized the plans for a new Titanic, but Blue Star has reportedly been flooded with requests for tickets — with some offering up to about $900,000 for a spot on the first trip.","The launch of Titanic II is imminent, and it will not be a cinematic spectacle but rather a voyage across the open sea. This replica of the renowned ""unsinkable"" vessel, famous for its tragic encounter with an iceberg on its inaugural journey on April 15, 1912, resulting in the loss of 1,503 lives, is currently being constructed. The maiden voyage of this ambitious undertaking, spearheaded by Australian tycoon and politician Clive Palmer, is scheduled for 2018. 

To meet contemporary regulations, this faithful recreation of the luxurious ship will be approximately 13 feet wider. Furthermore, it will have sufficient lifeboat capacity for all passengers, and its hull will be welded as a precautionary measure against potential iceberg encounters. These significant modifications, as reported by the Belfast Telegraph, ensure the safety of the vessel. 

James McDonald, the global marketing director of Blue Star Line, Palmer's company, affirmed that the new Titanic will embody modern advancements in technology. This includes implementing updated evacuation procedures, satellite controls, digital navigation systems, and radar technology that are expected for a ship of the 21st century. 

The newly constructed ship, boasting nine decks, will measure 885 feet in length, surpassing its ill-fated predecessor by two feet. With a height of 174 feet and a maximum speed of 24 knots, it will accommodate 2,400 passengers, 177 more than the RMS Titanic. In keeping with the original vessel, Titanic II will cater to different passenger classes, ranging from the opulent first class to the common folk in third class, reminiscent of the iconic movie featuring Leonardo DiCaprio. 

Unlike the original ship, which was built in Belfast, Titanic II is being constructed at the CSC Jinling Shipyard in Jiangsu, China. Its maiden voyage will depart from Jiangsu, China, and make its way to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, as reported by the aforementioned publication. 

While some relatives of the deceased passengers have expressed dissent towards the plans for a new Titanic, Blue Star Line has been inundated with ticket requests. According to reports, some individuals have even offered up to approximately $900,000 for a chance to be part of the ship's inaugural journey."

gossipcop-902467,"ATLANTIC CITY, NJ — Trashed by emails sent by pageant officials, former Miss Americas may help choose the new leaders of the Miss America Organization.  The group told The Associated Press Wednesday night that it is seeking the help of former Miss Americas and state directors to recommend the next generation of leaders for the pageant.  In emails that were published last week by the Huffington Post, pageant officials ridiculed the appearance, intellect and sex lives of former Miss Americas. The emails included one that used a vulgar term for female genitalia to refer to past Miss America winners, one that wished that a particular former Miss America had died and others that speculated about how many sex partners former Miss America Mallory Hagan has had.  The ensuing uproar led to the group’s executive director, Sam Haskell; its president, Josh Randle; board chairwoman Lynn Weidner, and one other board member to resign.  Dan Meyers, the group’s interim board chairman, said the group wants former Miss Americas and state directors to recommend members for a search committee that would determine the organization’s leadership structure, and choose individuals to fill those roles.  “The board wanted to have a process that was unprecedented in terms of openness, transparency and inclusion,” he said. “Given the turbulent nature of leadership transitions, asking all the stakeholders to be a part of this process was the best way.”  Some past winners reacted negatively to the board’s statement, saying the board had not reached out to them about help in selecting new leaders.

We stand united.”  Jennifer Vaden Barth, a former Miss North Carolina, said the former winners want a completely new board to search for leaders, not one that supported Haskell.  “The board needs to accept responsibility for the damage they have caused,” she told the AP late Wednesday. “They need to step aside quickly and allow new leadership to save the Miss America program.”  Under the plan, former Miss Americas and state directors collectively would name four people to the search committee, and the board would name a former state title holder to the panel. These five individuals and two board members “will begin their exhaustive search in a matter of days,” a statement from the board read.

gossipcop-859340,"Bethenny Frankel and Ramona Singer‘s feud fueled most of the action in season 9 of The Real Housewives of New York City — stemming from the moment Singer made the mistake of bringing up Frankel’s naked film past in the context of her 7-year-old daughter Bryn. From there, it was one fight after the next — each time Singer attempting to apologize only to dig a deeper and deeper hole for herself by insulting Frankel again and again. Get push notifications with news, features and more. First there was a chat in a restaurant during a group holiday party, where Singer attempted a more polite approach but got vicious when Frankel calmly told her “I don’t want to be schooled by you right now and I don’t like the way you’re speaking to me.” Then there was Singer’s Berkshires blowout — where she criticized everything from Frankel’s Skinnygirl empire to her relationship status to the real way she allegedly made her millions (sample: “You didn’t have any money until you f—–. You would date every guy for their f—— money”). It only got worse when Frankel disinvited Singer from a group vacation — causing Singer to launch into an emotional tirade about her divorce. “My f—— heart was cut out, my legs, my arms,” Singer said, tearing up. “So don’t even tell me and try to compare your life to mine. Don’t. Don’t. Just don’t, Bethenny. Have more respect for me. Have more respect and more sympathy. It’s not always about you.” Bethenny Frankel Bravo Ramona Singer Bravo Eventually the two would make a pact to drop the nasty comments. And during a tequila-filled trip to Mexico, the two would come to peace — having a heart-to-heart on pool floats while the Skinnygirl mogul skinny-dipped. “I’m f—ed up, okay? I’m f—ed up,” Singer said. “I’m a miserable person, I’m horrible, I’m a bad friend, I don’t know how to act. I am so sorry that I did what I did and I hurt you. I’ll never do that again. … I don’t want to be that person. I care about you and I don’t want to hurt you or anyone else I care about.” “That s— has to stop. You be a good friend. Who does that? Who acts like that?” Frankel told her in response. “I don’t want you to be that person. I know you don’t know. You’re not bad — you’re not an evil person. … I want you to be happy. I really do, I swear to God on my life I want you to be happy.” Bethenny Frankel and Ramona Singer Bravo So where does Frankel and Singer’s friendship stand now? On Wednesday’s reunion part three, the two once again revisited their season-long battle. And after exchanging another round of blows, they appeared to settle back into a truce — even hugging at the end. “The thing was all season, I just wanted you to be out of my way,” Frankel told Singer. “I’m not angry at you — I knew you had such anxiety coming in here. I don’t feel anger towards you. But do I need to be your best friend?

From there, it was one fight after the next — each time Singer attempting to apologize only to dig a deeper and deeper hole for herself by insulting Frankel again and again. Get push notifications with news, features and more. First there was a chat in a restaurant during a group holiday party, where Singer attempted a more polite approach but got vicious when Frankel calmly told her “I don’t want to be schooled by you right now and I don’t like the way you’re speaking to me.” Then there was Singer’s Berkshires blowout — where she criticized everything from Frankel’s Skinnygirl empire to her relationship status to the real way she allegedly made her millions (sample: “You didn’t have any money until you f—–. You would date every guy for their f—— money”). It only got worse when Frankel disinvited Singer from a group vacation — causing Singer to launch into an emotional tirade about her divorce. “My f—— heart was cut out, my legs, my arms,” Singer said, tearing up. “So don’t even tell me and try to compare your life to mine. Don’t. Don’t. Just don’t, Bethenny. Have more respect for me. Have more respect and more sympathy. It’s not always about you.” Bethenny Frankel Bravo Ramona Singer Bravo Eventually the two would make a pact to drop the nasty comments. And during a tequila-filled trip to Mexico, the two would come to peace — having a heart-to-heart on pool floats while the Skinnygirl mogul skinny-dipped. “I’m f—ed up, okay? I’m f—ed up,” Singer said. “I’m a miserable person, I’m horrible, I’m a bad friend, I don’t know how to act. I am so sorry that I did what I did and I hurt you. I’ll never do that again. … I don’t want to be that person. I care about you and I don’t want to hurt you or anyone else I care about.” “That s— has to stop. You be a good friend. Who does that? Who acts like that?” Frankel told her in response. “I don’t want you to be that person. I know you don’t know. You’re not bad — you’re not an evil person. … I want you to be happy. I really do, I swear to God on my life I want you to be happy.” Bethenny Frankel and Ramona Singer Bravo So where does Frankel and Singer’s friendship stand now? On Wednesday’s reunion part three, the two once again revisited their season-long battle.

[But] it was not coming out of viciousness, it was not coming out of maliciousness,” Singer said, explaining that she had been sent the article from a friend a week before talking with Frankel about it. “My first concern in the back of my head was remembering that [former New York City Housewife] Alex McCord had a naked picture in one of the weeklies [in season 1],” Singer recalled. “And [my daughter Avery’s] school was upset, she was almost asked to leave. … I was like, ‘Oh my God, I hope everything’s okay with Bryn.

This unwavering attitude, which we greatly admire, was confirmed yesterday when People magazine released an article quoting an unnamed ""source"" who claimed that Khloe is content with her decision to remain in Cleveland with her daughter True, and that marriage to Tristan Thompson is a future possibility, despite the unfortunate infidelity scandal. 

According to the supposed insider, Khloe has expressed her desire to eventually tie the knot, but there have been no serious discussions about a wedding taking place. Nevertheless, she envisions a future with Thompson and firmly believes that they can overcome their challenges, ensuring a fulfilling life together.

Merely two hours after the article's publication, Khloe took to Twitter to express her disbelief regarding the creation of fictional stories and question the credibility of these so-called ""sources."" Although it is uncertain whether she was specifically referring to this particular story, it is certainly plausible. Do you understand where I am coming from?

While Khloe has refrained from directly addressing the Tristan situation, she has been posting enigmatic quotes on her social media, leaving us puzzled as to the true nature of her current circumstances. Last week, she tweeted, ""You will never ever regret being kind to someone."" In response to a comment suggesting that kindness may go unappreciated by some, Khloe replied, ""Never give to get. Always try to give without expectations, be it tangible or emotional.""

More recently, she took to Instagram Stories to share some profound thoughts: ""Your mind will always believe everything you tell it. Feed it faith. Feed it truth. Feed it with love."" She followed up with, ""Nobody cares about your story until you win. So win.""

The question remains: will Khloe marry Tristan or not? Unfortunately, her cryptic posts provide little clarity on her current stance."

After deciding that she just can’t let go of this hunk, Mariah reportedly decided to make it happen – an engagement, that is! “Word is Mariah took matters into her own hands,” a source tells OK! magazine, “It was an unusual proposal but it did the trick. She wrote a song about how she wanted Bryan to be her husband and she performed it for him while wearing a sexy, glitzy gown. Then she explained that she’s ready for them to make their relationship official.”  Bryan gave a “hearty yes,” as the insider says, “He couldn’t believe his luck!” It appears Bryan also thinks he and Mariah belong together, and he always wants to be her baby.

While love takes time, Mariah and Bryan are already busy making wedding plans. “Mariah would love to get married in May at the Grand Wailea Resort in Maui,” the insider told OK!, “where she and Bryan first went public with their romance.” Mariah and Bryan struck up a relationship in late 2016, with Mariah low-key confirming the romance in February 2017 by calling Bryan her “boyfriend.”  Mariah’s “also toying with the idea of a winter wonderland wedding,” the source says. “After all, she is the queen of Christmas!” Could Mariah have the fantasy holiday wedding she’s always wanted, saying “Thank God I found you” to her honey, her all?

Nick and Mariah’s twins – son Morocco and daughter Monroe, 6 – will be featured in his wedding, and sources say Mariah’s thinking of asking Nick to walk her down the aisle. “[He] will always be a big part of her life,” the source added.

According to reliable sources, Mariah was inspired by her deep affection for Bryan and decided to take matters into her own hands. In a heartfelt gesture, she composed a song expressing her desire for Bryan to be her husband, which she performed for him while dressed in an elegant gown. Following this touching moment, Mariah revealed her readiness to formalize their relationship.

Bryan, overjoyed by the unexpected proposal, enthusiastically accepted Mariah's offer. It is clear that he shares her sentiment and wishes to be a constant presence in her life. Without wasting any time, the couple is already involved in planning their wedding. The celebrated Grand Wailea Resort in Maui has been suggested as a potential venue, as it has significant sentimental value to Mariah and Bryan, being the place where they first revealed their romance to the public.

This potential union would mark Mariah's third marriage, with her previous spouses being Tommy Mottola, 68, and Nick Cannon, 37. Having experienced heartbreak in the past and being mindful of her substantial fortune, estimated at $520 million, Mariah is taking precautions to protect her assets. Reports indicate that she is diligently working on a comprehensive prenuptial agreement to ensure financial security.

Despite the end of their marriage, Mariah and Nick Cannon have maintained a strong bond for the sake of their two children, twins Morocco and Monroe, who are currently six years old. It is expected that Nick will play an important role in Mariah's wedding, possibly walking her down the aisle. This conclusion is supported by their recent appearance together at the 2018 Kids' Choice Awards, where they showcased a united front for their children.

In light of these developments, it remains uncertain when Mariah will be ready to fully commit to marriage once again. However, when that time comes, rest assured that our team will be eagerly awaiting the privilege of attending her momentous celebration."
gossipcop-8581615474,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.

There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T","Katie Holmes finds herself in a challenging situation, as numerous reports surrounding her personal life continue to circulate. These reports revolve around her romantic involvement with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, her ex-husband Tom Cruise, and their daughter Suri. According to RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of a wedding ceremony worth $300,000, where Suri would serve as the bridesmaid. This union would have solidified their five-year relationship, which has largely remained concealed from the public eye. However, it seems that Holmes became aware of Foxx's reluctance to abandon his flirtatious tendencies, including maintaining a friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother of his daughter. RadarOnline alleges that Foxx attended Leonardo DiCaprio's birthday party with Grannis, not Holmes. Consequently, Holmes made the decision to call off the wedding and privately informed Foxx of their separation. A source cited by RadarOnline claims that Foxx rejected the idea of signing a prenuptial agreement with a no-cheating clause, as he began to understand the potential consequences of being unfaithful to his partner. Holmes grew concerned about Foxx's behavior, recognizing the lack of respect and the detrimental effect it could have on herself and Suri. Meanwhile, Holmes has supposedly faced ongoing attempts by Cruise, her ex-husband and Hollywood superstar, to regain a place in their daughter Suri's life. Despite not having seen his daughter for over five years due to the restrictions imposed by his Church of Scientology, Cruise allegedly regrets his absence and wishes to play a more active role in Suri's life, according to reports in Hollywood Life based on Star magazine. The Star cites an insider who claims that Cruise, being a devoted Scientologist, unquestioningly complied with the instructions of church leaders who prohibited him from seeing Suri. However, Cruise has grown tired of being manipulated by these authorities and desires a reunion with his daughter. The Star also discloses an alleged agreement between Holmes and Cruise, wherein Holmes vowed to keep quiet about Cruise and the Church of Scientology, on the condition that Cruise steers clear of their daughter and avoids attempting to indoctrinate her into the controversial religious organization. Nevertheless, Holmes feels torn between her desire to protect Suri and the possibility of mending the relationship between father and daughter. As an insider informed the Star, Holmes is gradually considering the idea of a reunion, understanding that Suri may be yearning for her father's presence. Holmes is starting to trust Cruise's assurance that he will refrain from involving their daughter in his religious beliefs. Representatives for Holmes have dismissed both the reports of her breakup with Foxx and the potential reunion between Cruise and Suri. Notably, Holmes' publicist, Leslie Sloane, personally denies the breakup report and attaches her name to the statement. This denial holds significance, as it represents the first official acknowledgement, on record, from either Holmes or Foxx that their relationship exists. Holmes and Foxx have gone to great lengths to keep their relationship under wraps since they reportedly began dating in 2013. Holmes even disguised herself once to meet Foxx at a restaurant to avoid public attention. These measures were necessary as part of Holmes' divorce settlement with Cruise, which legally obligated her not to date anyone publicly for five years after their separation, as reported in September 2017. Speculation arose when Holmes and Foxx were photographed together on a Malibu beach, hand in hand, suggesting that they were aware of the paparazzi's presence and that the five-year public dating ban had expired."
