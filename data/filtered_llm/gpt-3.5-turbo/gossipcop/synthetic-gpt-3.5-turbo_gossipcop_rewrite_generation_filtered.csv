Dancing With the Stars will return for its 22nd season with Len Goodman back where he belongs, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champ, and a baby boy or girl for Allison Holker. There's much to look forward to, but not before we close out this season one last time with everything that happened after the finale! (In case you missed it, you can read our recap of the best and worst moments here .) Almost an hour after Tom Bergeron declared Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough the winners of season 21, Bindi was still in disbelief, shouting from the top of her lungs, ""I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!"" Her exuberance and genuine nature endeared her to literally every one on set, but no one more so than Derek. ""It's just so special with Bindi,"" he told reporters backstage. ""She's a champion of life."" Bindi shared the same sentiment, telling those in the ballroom that she gained another brother in Derek. In case you needed further proof that the two are friends for life, consider this: Derek's hopping on a plane to Australia in a couple weeks ""to tackle crocodiles and get my official khakis!"" The Houghster may have nabbed his sixth Mirrorball trophy, but it was his partnership with Bindi that undoubtedly made it his favorite season. ""There's not a thing I would change about this season,"" he told Glamour post-show. ""There's not a week I would change, a dance I would change, and that was a very calming, very peaceful feeling. The show is a completely different show than the first time I won, and to win at this level and the standard that this show has been raised to, it's been incredible."" While Bindi and Derek make the press rounds in New York City, it's no secret that she's itching to get back to her hometown down under. ""I can't wait to get back to all the animals, continue all the conservation work, and carry on in my dad's footsteps."" Season 21 runner-ups Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter were understandably disappointed not to win the big prize, but they both praised Bindi and Derek for their phenomenal journey this season. ""Bindi was the whole package,"" praised the red-haired stunner. ""She and Derek had a beautiful partnership."" Still, ""it's bittersweet in may ways. Did I really want this to be my first Mirrorball? Absolutely. I would be lying if I said I didn't. But Bindi was undeniable this entire season. She grew so much, and she's just such a beautiful person you can't help but be captivated by her. Both [she and Nick] are winners, and I truly believe that."" Echoed Nick: ""It was just such a pleasure to be here. I didn't expect to get anything, so anytime something great happened in the competition, it was a pleasant surprise to me."" So what's up next for Nick? Well, aside from getting ready for Baby Boy Carter , his solo album ( All American ) drops today, and he has a movie coming out next year that he wrote and directed. As for third-place contestant, Alek Skarlatos , he'll be heading on the DWTS Tour this winter, but his immediate plans are much simpler: ""I can't wait to get on the plane tonight to eat. A lot."" But what about his dating life? Any updates on that? ""It's been pretty crazy, honestly. [I haven't had time] for many dates lately."" Added Lindsay: ""I'll be his wing woman on tour!"" During all the hectic action backstage, Allison Holker was a ball of energy, especially for someone six month's pregnant. ""I feel incredible!"" gushed the pro.

""Yeah, and we'd probably win,"" she laughed of the possibility of being paired with Mark's best friend and honorary brother. Speaking of Derek, Mark told us backstage that getting to perform with BC (who he called ""the love of my life"") while Derek and Bindi danced was his favorite part of the evening.

Dancing With the Stars will be returning for its 22nd season with Len Goodman returning as a judge, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champion, and Allison Holker expecting a baby. Before we move on to the new season, let's take a moment to recap what happened after the finale. Almost an hour after Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough were declared the winners of season 21, Bindi expressed her disbelief and excitement by shouting, ""I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!"" Bindi's genuine nature and enthusiasm won over everyone on set, especially Derek. Derek told reporters backstage, ""It's just so special with Bindi. She's a champion of life."" Bindi echoed this sentiment, saying that she gained another brother in Derek. Their friendship is evident as Derek plans to visit Australia in a few weeks for crocodile adventures. This season was particularly special for Derek, as his partnership with Bindi made it his favorite. Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter, the season 21 runners-up, praised Bindi and Derek for their incredible journey. Sharna called Bindi the whole package and said she had a beautiful partnership with Derek. Nick expressed his enjoyment of being on the show and found each great moment to be a pleasant surprise. As for what's next, Nick has a solo album dropping and a movie coming out next year, all while preparing for fatherhood. Third-place contestant, Alek Skarlatos, will be going on the DWTS Tour this winter, but his immediate plan is to enjoy a satisfying meal. Allison Holker, who is six months pregnant, was full of energy backstage. She expressed her delight at dancing while pregnant and will find out the baby's gender on December 10. Allison is also preparing for her first Thanksgiving in charge of the turkey and is learning techniques from The Chew. One of the major announcements backstage was that Len Goodman will be returning as a judge next season. The pros, including Mark Ballas and Allison Holker, are thrilled to have him back. Casting is currently underway for season 22, and Mark hopes his girlfriend, BC Jean, will be a contestant. Mark joked that if she competed, they would probably be given to Derek as a pair. Mark's favorite moment of the evening was performing with BC while Derek and Bindi danced. It was a unique and amazing experience for him.",rewrite_generation

The son of an Army major, Strahan grew up in Germany and did not play competitive high school football until his senior year when his parents sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in Texas.  The former defensive end played well enough to earn a scholarship to Texas Southern University. By his senior year of college, he had set a record for sacks, which got the attention of the NFL.  In 1993, the New York Giants drafted Strahan as the 40th overall draft pick. Over the next 14 seasons, he became the league’s all-time quarterback sack leader, played in the Pro Bowl and helped the Giants defeat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII.  Upon retiring in 2008, Strahan concentrated on his off-field talents. In 2012, he became Kelly Ripa’s “Live! With Kelly” co-host, replacing longtime host Regis Philbin. Four years later, he left the show and joined ABC’s “Good Morning America”; it took more than a year for “Live” to announce Ryan Seacrest as its new co-host.  Strahan also serves as a Fox NFL Sunday analyst during the football season.  As of May 2017, Strahan’s net worth was $65 million, with a salary of $17 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.

With Kelly and Michael.”","Michael Strahan's net worth has been built through a combination of his successful football career and his endeavors as a talk-show host. Despite humble beginnings, Strahan's talent and dedication propelled him to great heights. Having grown up in Germany, it was not until his senior year of high school that he began playing competitive football after his parents sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in Texas. 

Strahan's skills on the field earned him a scholarship to Texas Southern University, where he excelled and set a record for sacks by his senior year. This accomplishment caught the attention of the NFL, leading to his draft by the New York Giants in 1993 as the 40th overall pick. Over the course of his 14-year career, Strahan cemented himself as the all-time quarterback sack leader in the league, earning multiple Pro Bowl appearances and a Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII.

Upon retiring from football in 2008, Strahan redirected his focus towards his off-field talents. In 2012, he joined Kelly Ripa as the co-host of ""Live! With Kelly"", replacing the long-standing host Regis Philbin. Four years later, Strahan made the move to ABC's ""Good Morning America"", leaving behind a void that would take over a year to fill with the announcement of Ryan Seacrest as the new co-host of ""Live"".

Strahan's impressive career also extends to his work as a Fox NFL Sunday analyst during the football season. His expertise and insights have made him a respected figure in the field. As of May 2017, Strahan's net worth was estimated to be around $65 million, accompanied by an annual salary of $17 million.

In addition to his television ventures, Strahan has kept himself busy with other projects. He currently serves as a full-time co-host on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" and hosts his own game show, ""The $100,000 Pyramid"". Strahan's entrepreneurial spirit led him to launch his own clothing line in 2015, which is available in JC Penney stores.

Throughout his football career, Strahan made a name for himself as a fierce defender, constantly sacking quarterbacks. He even set a record for most sacks in an NFL season in 2001. His excellence on the field earned him seven Pro Bowl appearances. Following his retirement, Strahan continued to garner accolades in his new role as a morning show host. He has received two Daytime Emmy Awards for ""Outstanding Talk Show Host"" for his work on ""Live! With Kelly and Michael"".",rewrite_generation

(This is always an exciting moment in a ceremony.) It was an extraordinary mix of tradition and modernity, of centuries of history and up-to-the moment flourishes. Oprah was here, and so was Meghan’s mother, an African-American social worker who wore a conventional mother-of-the-bride outfit and also a nose stud. It somehow looked charming and just right. The entire royal family was here, along with a complement of English aristocrats and important personages. The music was stately and beautiful. The setting was awe-inspiring. There was a flotilla of clergymen, an extraordinary mélange including the archbishop of Canterbury and — in a striking inclusion in this most ancient of places — the head of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev.

It was absolutely simple: pure and sculptural, in double bonded silk cady with a wide boatneck, long sleeves and sweeping train. It was Meghan Markle’s wedding dress. It was by Clare Waight Keller, a British woman and the first female designer of Givenchy. And it was everything people had hoped. This was not a Cinderella choice, not one that spoke of fantasy or old-fashioned fairy tales. Instead, it placed the woman proudly front and center and underscored Ms. Markle’s own independence. At the same time, it celebrated female strength, promoted a local designer and reached a hand across to Europe (where Ms. Waight Keller has a day job).

Part of the change in tone is down to the passage of time and to how much Britain, or perhaps the royal family, has changed in the last few years. Another reason, of course, is that Harry, being the second son and not a future king, has the freedom to be more relaxed, less constrained by tradition, and less conventional than his brother. This wedding has nothing to do with dynasty, or ensuring the security of the royal line. (We hope they have kids! But only because it’s fun to have kids, not because it would be some sort of international crisis if they did not.) This wedding had everything to do with two people who are totally into each other and wanted to have a great big happy celebration. Oprah, Beckhams and Clooneys, oh my! Photo One of the great excitements about any wedding, of course, is the moment you learn who has been invited and who has not. Meghan and Harry’s list was kept secret, until the very moment that dozens of mysterious figures started to enter St. George’s Chapel. It was very exciting. There was none other than Oprah Winfrey, in a snug pink dress, a pair of very cool sunglasses and a massive broad-brimmed hat spectacularly festooned with flowers. If anyone qualifies as American royalty, it is surely Oprah, with her ability to transcend race and background, and her great gift for openness and emotional candor. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Kate Middleton’s parents, Carole and Michael, were there. They have always done such a good job of wearing appropriate outfits, smiling tastefully and saying nothing. There was Charles Spencer, the Earl of Althorp, Diana’s brother, perhaps known best for his active love life and his impassioned attack on the British media after his sister’s death. It turned into Celebrity Central. George and Amal Clooney made their stately, Hollywood-y entrance (She was in yellow with an interesting train). David and Victoria Beckham, a.k.a. Posh and Becks, came in and graced some people in the crowd with their conversation.","The atmosphere was filled with happiness and tranquility as both of them exchanged their vows. Their radiant smiles and relaxed demeanor captivated everyone present, and fortunately, no objections were raised to their union. This pivotal moment in the ceremony never fails to stir excitement among the attendees. The event itself was an extraordinary amalgamation of tradition and modernity, seamlessly blending centuries of history with contemporary touches. The presence of prominent figures such as Oprah and Meghan's mother, an African-American social worker, added to the charm and appropriateness of the occasion. The entire royal family, along with esteemed English aristocrats and dignitaries, graced the celebration. The music resonated with dignity and beauty, while the venue itself inspired awe. Notably, a diverse assembly of clergymen, including the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Most Rev. Michael Curry, head of the Episcopal Church, were in attendance. Bishop Curry, an African-American, delivered a passionate address quoting Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., emphasizing the significance of love in religion and life. Following his speech, Lady Jane Fellowes, Harry's aunt, conveyed both joy and a sense that the lingering sorrow from his mother's passing had finally lifted. Her recitation, a passage from the Song of Solomon, moved everyone: ""Arise my love, my fair one, and come away; for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.""

The wedding dress itself was a resounding success, evoking a sense of simplicity and elegance. Designed by Clare Waight Keller, the first female designer of Givenchy, it represented Meghan Markle's independence and highlighted female strength. The choice to showcase a local designer and establish connections with Europe further added to its significance. The five-meter veil, adorned with hand-embroidered flowers, symbolized the flora of all 53 Commonwealth nations. Interestingly, Clare Waight Keller's name had never been mentioned in the midst of circulating rumors about the dress, making it a delightful surprise that surpassed expectations.

Unlike previous royal weddings, which exuded a solemn and formal atmosphere, this celebration radiated a sense of joy and camaraderie. The guests mingled with one another, exchanging air-kisses and engaging in lively conversations. It felt like a grand royal and celebrity gathering, akin to the excitement of the Academy Awards. The change in tone can be attributed to the passing of time and the evolving nature of the royal family and Britain itself. Prince Harry, as the second son and not in line for the throne, enjoyed the freedom to be more relaxed and non-traditional compared to his brother. This wedding was not about securing the royal line or maintaining dynasty. It was a testament to the love and happiness between two individuals who wished to celebrate their union in grand fashion.

The guest list for the wedding was a topic of great intrigue, and as the mysterious figures entered St. George's Chapel, excitement filled the air. The presence of iconic figures such as Oprah Winfrey, with her remarkable ability to transcend boundaries and connect with people from all walks of life, added to the event's grandeur. Kate Middleton's parents, Carole and Michael, carried themselves with grace and elegance, as they have always done. Charles Spencer, Diana's brother, known for his eventful personal life and passionate defense of his sister against the British media, was also in attendance. The wedding became a haven for celebrities, with stars like George and Amal Clooney and David and Victoria Beckham captivating the crowd with their presence and engaging in conversations with admirers.",rewrite_generation

Lovato also had brief flings with Trace Cyrus (Miley’s older brother) in 2009 and Joe Jonas, her self-proclaimed “BFF,” in 2010. Her most notable relationship to date, however, has been with Valderrama, whom she dated from from 2010 to 2016. In an interview with Latina magazine, Lovato discussed what attracted her to the That 70’s Show actor: When I dated white guys, it wasn’t as passionate as my relationship with Wilmer. Maybe that’s just Wilmer. But I do believe that Latin people are just more expressive, more passionate with their emotions. He’s very manly, and he can be stubborn like Latino men can, but he’s protective and he cares so much and loves so hard. I’ve been blessed enough to have him in my life, and not just as my man, but also my best friend. Since her breakup from Valderrama, Lovato’s been seen with MMA fighter Guilherme “Bomba” Vasconcelos and Abedini. 3.

By the way, love is fluid.” The singer added “Whether there’s been rumours with one specific person or not, that’s all that matters. Humans are humans, and when you connect with somebody on a spiritual level it doesn’t matter. I don’t want people to ever look at the past or rumours or anything and try to figure me out.” 4.

He was spotted with newly blond hair at designer Rick Owens' furniture show in Los Angeles .","As the end of the year approaches, it has become customary for people to express their dissatisfaction with the previous months, claiming them to be the worst ever. However, this year, that sentiment feels particularly strong. The headlines have been dominated by a barrage of bizarre and disheartening news, creating a sense of living in a dystopian nightmare. This sentiment is so pervasive that even the Kardashian-West family has chosen to end their year prematurely. Kim and Kanye have decided to cancel all their public and professional commitments, as well as maintain a blackout on their social media presence. A representative of the couple has confirmed to Page Six that they intend to take the rest of the year off and prioritize family time.

In reality, many of us wish we could do the same. Is it possible for President Obama's final act to be an executive decree granting us all an opportunity to relax and recuperate for the remaining 26 days of this challenging year? While such a decree cannot prevent potential tragedies or disasters, or even the loss of music legends, it could offer a respite. Perhaps we could enact a ""Netflix and Chill Act,"" allowing all Americans to take the following month to unwind and catch up on missed television series.

Considering Kim and Kanye's recent struggles, it is understandable why they have decided to cancel the remainder of their 2016 commitments. Kim has been recovering from a traumatic robbery incident in Paris, while Kanye experienced a highly publicized breakdown that led to his hospitalization. These personal tragedies have unfolded under an intense public spotlight, with numerous rumors circulating in the tabloid press. According to E!, a source close to the family reports that Kim is coping well despite the media speculation. The source affirms her commitment to supporting Kanye and helping him recover. Kanye was discharged from the hospital last week after receiving treatment for exhaustion. Kim remains by his side, ensuring he continues to receive the necessary therapy and care.

Regardless of personal opinions about the couple, it is evident that they deserve a period of rest. In addition to their personal challenges, they are also responsible for caring for their two young children, one of whom is celebrating their first birthday today. It would be wise for us to respect their need for solitude and relaxation over the next month. Unfortunately, most of us do not have the luxury to do the same, despite our yearning for respite. Furthermore, it seems that 2017 may not bring much relief either. Nonetheless, we can only hope that a well-rested and healthier Kim and Kanye will be able to provide the distractions we so desperately need in the coming year. As an update, Kanye has recently made a low-key appearance in public, sporting newly blond hair at a furniture show in Los Angeles hosted by designer Rick Owens.",rewrite_generation

The distinguished groom, Prince Harry, belongs to the esteemed British royal family, while the bride, Meghan Markle, hails from the United States and brings with her a background in acting. On the auspicious morning of their nuptials, Prince Harry's beloved grandmother, none other than Queen Elizabeth II, bestowed upon him the esteemed titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton, and Baron Kilkeel. In a gesture of marital union, Meghan Markle, upon her wedding, became the Duchess of Sussex. The esteemed Archbishop of Canterbury, the honorable Justin Welby, officiated the matrimonial proceedings, employing the customary Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony, as prescribed in the revered liturgical text of the Church of England, aptly named Common Worship.

The announcement of their engagement, which had long been a topic of intense public speculation, came after Prince Harry, the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales, had been courting Meghan Markle, a talented American actress, since 2016. Their paths first intertwined in the month of July in that same year. The existence of their relationship was officially acknowledged on the 8th of November 2016 when a statement from the royal family's communications secretary was released, addressing the distressing ""wave of abuse and harassment"" that had been directed towards Markle. It was on the 27th of November 2017 when Clarence House made the joyous proclamation that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle would embark on the journey of matrimony in the spring of 2018. Their engagement, which had transpired earlier that same month in the city of London, witnessed the Prince offering his beloved a bespoke engagement ring, crafted by the revered Cleave and Company, who proudly hold the august position of court jewellers and medalists to the Queen. The exquisite ring showcased a magnificent central diamond sourced from Botswana, encircled by two smaller diamonds from his mother's cherished collection of jewelry. Simultaneously, it was revealed that upon their nuptials, the couple would reside in Nottingham Cottage, nestled within the splendid grounds of Kensington Palace. The Queen, accompanied by her esteemed consort, the Duke of Edinburgh, expressed profound delight at this momentous news, while felicitations poured in from around the globe, encompassing various political leaders, including the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. Responding to this tidal wave of congratulations, the couple partook in an exclusive interview with the esteemed Mishal Husain of BBC News.

During the notable public announcement of their engagement, held amidst the enchanting surroundings of Sunken Gardens within Kensington Palace, Meghan Markle was resplendent in a breathtaking bottle knee-length emerald green dress, featuring artful bow detailing at the cinched waist, which was artfully crafted by the renowned Italian fashion house, P.A.R.O.S.H. She complemented this elegant ensemble with a magnificent white trench coat, created by the esteemed Canadian brand, Line the Label. Such was the fervor surrounding this momentous declaration that within hours of its release, the website of Line the Label succumbed to the unprecedented influx of individuals eager to procure the coveted coat for themselves. The marriage between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle holds special significance as it marks the union of the second-ever American individual, as well as the first individual of mixed race heritage, with the eminent British royal family. The news of their engagement sparked widespread commentary on the potential societal implications of Markle proudly and prominently taking on the role of a mixed-race royal. It is notable to mention that as per the provisions of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the consent of the Sovereign is required for the first six individuals in line to the throne in order to enter into matrimony. At the time of their engagement, Prince Harry ranked fifth in the line of succession. On the 14th of March 2018, the Queen's consent was officially proclaimed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. Notwithstanding the fact that Meghan Markle had attended a private Catholic school during her formative years, it is important to highlight that she does not follow the Roman Catholic faith. In March 2018, she undertook the profound step of being baptized and confirmed into the Church of England within the historic confines of St. James's Palace, with the revered Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, bestowing upon her this sacred sacrament. It is also pertinent to mention that despite Markle having been previously married, the Anglican Church has, since 2002, embraced the notion of marriage to individuals who have experienced divorce, while their former spouse remains living. Following their engagement, Meghan Markle embarked on an intricate and lengthy process to obtain British citizenship, a journey she will undertake while retaining her U.S. citizenship. However, it must be stated that Kensington Palace has yet to announce whether she will maintain dual nationality. Retaining U.S. citizenship during this transition is anticipated to give rise to certain complexities in matters of taxation. Displaying their commitment to unity and familial harmony, the couple was honored with an invitation to join the royal family in celebrating the joyous occasion of Christmas in 2017 at the illustrious Sandringham estate of Her Majesty, the Queen. The esteemed Alexi Lubomirski, a former protege of Mario Testino, captured their love and radiance in the enchanting official engagement photographs, which were taken within the splendid confines of Frogmore House, and subsequently released by Kensington Palace on the 21st of December 2017. In commemoration of the momentous wedding between Prince Harry and Meghan, the Royal Mint of the United Kingdom produced a dedicated and officially sanctioned £5 coin, which strikingly depicts the blissful couple in profile. Additionally, Royal Mail introduced a set of commemorative postage stamps featuring the official engagement photographs of the couple, further enshrining their union within the beloved and cherished traditions of the British postal system.

Moving on to the eminent day of their wedding, it is noteworthy to mention that unlike the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the eagerly anticipated nuptials of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were not declared a public holiday. The chosen date, the 19th of May 2018, coincided with the hallowed day of the FA Cup Final, an event traditionally attended by Prince Harry's brother, Prince William, in his capacity as the President of the esteemed Football Association. The decision to hold the wedding on a weekend departed from the customary royal tradition of conducting these momentous ceremonies on a weekday. On the 12th of February 2018, Kensington Palace, with great anticipation, revealed that the wedding ceremony would commence at precisely 12:00 noon, British Summer Time.

Moving on to the significant matter of the wedding venue, the momentous occasion unfolded within the revered and sacred walls of St George's Chapel, situated within the serene confines of Windsor. This exquisite chapel had previously played host to the wedding ceremonies of Prince Harry's uncle, the Earl of Wessex, as well as his cousin, Peter Phillips. Additionally, it served as the sacred setting for the celebratory blessing of the marriage between the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, who holds the cherished distinction of being Prince Harry's remarkable stepmother.

Addressing the matter of expenses, it has been officially announced that the esteemed royal family shall bear the financial burden of the wedding ceremony. While the intricate wedding cake, the delightful floral arrangements, and the sumptuous catering services have been estimated to cost £50,000, £110,000, and £286,000 respectively, the overall expenditure is anticipated to amount to approximately £32 million. Notably, the security costs for this auspicious occasion are expected to be lower in comparison to the momentous wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011. On a local level, the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead has reportedly allocated an estimated £2.6 million to ensure the pristine cleanliness and flawless appearance of the town and its surrounding thoroughfares. Predictions abound that the wedding shall trigger a much-anticipated upsurge in tourism, subsequently bolstering the economic prospects of the entire region, surpassing an impressive £500 million.

Of particular significance is the matter of wedding attire. The meticulously designed wedding invitations explicitly set forth a dress code for gentlemen, which required the donning of ""Dress Uniform, Morning Coat...""",rewrite_generation

Miley Cyrus said “Hail Satan” on live radio and claimed she has a closer relationship with the devil than with her “earthly father”, Billy R","Prominent Figures Linked to Controversial Cannibal Restaurant in Los Angeles

In a shocking turn of events, leaked documents have shed light on the clandestine activities taking place at the notorious Cannibal Club, an exclusive restaurant tucked away in the city of Los Angeles. With rumors swirling for years regarding its patrons and the nature of its offerings, the recent revelations have brought to light some unexpected names among its elite clientele. Katy Perry, Meryl Streep, Anderson Cooper, as well as Chelsea Clinton, have all been connected to this secretive establishment.

Under the guise of being at the forefront of experimental cuisine, the Cannibal Club takes pride in serving its unique fare to what they refer to as ""L.A.'s cultural elite."" The restaurant openly admits to specializing in the preparation of human meat sourced from young and healthy individuals. While this admission may be unsettling to most, it is worth noting that the club's visiting chefs are said to hail from various corners of the globe, providing them with the freedom to practice their craft without compromise or convention.

According to their website, the Cannibal Club boasts an exclusive clientele made up of celebrated figures from the realms of film, literature, and entertainment. On event nights, guests are treated to avant-garde performances, intellectual discussions, and mesmerizing musical performances, all in the spirit of celebrating artistic excellence and the boundless nature of the human spirit.

Chef de Cuisine Sophie Laffite describes each dish as a ""study in taste and elegance,"" emphasizing that the meat served is meticulously chosen from the young and healthy. In a peculiar tradition, reminiscent of anthropology practices in certain primitive societies, the club regards the consumption of human flesh as a tribute to the departed, who are believed to be reborn through their consumption.

While the Cannibal Club appears intriguing, gaining access to this private establishment proves to be a challenge. The club's website highlights their strict vetting policy, designed to ensure that its members align with their enlightened ideals and to prevent any disruption from the less-enlightened masses.

A glimpse into their current menu reveals unusual offerings such as flame-broiled Sirloin Steak made from human meat, Liver and Mushroom Pirozhi, a baked Russian delicacy featuring a savory filling of wild mushrooms and human liver, as well as Placenta Lasagne, a unique twist on the traditional dish with minced placenta substituting one layer of cheese.

When questioned about the sources of their human meat, Elspeth Blake, the proprietor of the Cannibal Club, who boasts experience under Vincent Sardi Jr. in New York, remained tight-lipped on the matter, declining to provide further details.

Adding to the already unsettling nature of this revelation, the club's FAQ section explains that many suppliers prefer to maintain their anonymity, while individuals often bequeath their bodies to the establishment for various reasons. For some, this serves as an unconventional solution for supplementing life insurance or offsetting funeral expenses. Others, like Gwendoline Fenwich, a member of the Cannibal Club, have opted to be prepared as a meal, viewing it as an alternative to more traditional burial or cremation practices.

This shocking news, linking Hollywood figures, pop icons, and cable news anchors with the consumption of human flesh, is just another example of public figures engaging in darker activities. Recent episodes have seen Jay-Z referring to Jesus Christ as ""the original fake news"" and Miley Cyrus openly declaring ""Hail Satan"" on live radio, while boldly claiming a closer bond with the devil than her own earthly father.

The revelation of these unsettling connections raises numerous questions and casts a shadow over those who have frequented this establishment. As the public grapples with the implications of such revelations, it remai",rewrite_generation

According to a new report, the Real Housewives of New Jersey star is planning to cash in on her husband Joe Giudice’s deportation proceedings.  If you recall, it was reported weeks ago that a judge had ruled that Joe should be deported upon his release from prison, where he is currently serving a 41-month-prison sentence for bank and wire fraud. Well now, sources are telling Radar Online that Bravo has offered Teresa $500,000 to film a special about his deportation.  “Teresa was offered big bucks to film a special about Joe’s deportation and she agreed to do it,” an insider revealed. “Half a million dollars to share the story on camera.”  And this story is believable because this isn’t Teresa’s first rodeo when it comes to cashing in on her crimes legal drama!  “It is going to be like the other specials when she was in prison and will show how she and Joe and the girls are handling the scary prospect of Joe getting deported,” added the source.  IS TERESA BEGGING PRESIDENT TRUMP TO STOP JOE’S DEPORTATION?  Earlier this year, an Immigration official confirmed that “records show that an immigration judge ordered Mr. Giudice be removed from the United States on March 14, 2018.”  A source close to Teresa adds that she needs the Bravo money as Joe tries to appeal the deportation order.  “Teresa will do anything for the money. She never stops thinking about taking care of her girls and she agreed to this so that they would have money for college. She is a good mom and wants to provide for her children,” the source stated.  Joe will reportedly be turned over to ICE custody upon his March 2019 release, although it is likely he could be released earlier than March which would mean an earlier deportation back to Italy.

As previously reported, a judge recently ruled that Joe would be deported once he completes his 41-month prison sentence for bank and wire fraud. According to sources, Bravo has offered Teresa $500,000 to film a special documenting Joe's deportation. Despite the seemingly outrageous nature of this story, it holds credibility given Teresa's history of leveraging her legal troubles for financial gain. The special will provide insight into how Teresa, Joe, and their family are coping with the unsettling possibility of Joe's deportation. Earlier this year, an immigration judge ordered Joe's removal from the United States, prompting Teresa to consider the offer from Bravo in light of Joe's impending appeal. Recognizing her responsibility as a mother, Teresa is determined to secure a stable future for her children, which is why she has agreed to participate in this project. Joe is expected to be transferred to ICE custody upon his release in March 2019, and there is a possibility that he could be deported to Italy even earlier. However, it is important to note that Teresa's legal representative, James Leonard, has refuted the claims made in this report, stating that Teresa currently has no intention of pursuing a spinoff show focused on Joe's potential deportation.",rewrite_generation

A representative for the ""Ocean's Eleven"" star tells the site that the story made by National Enquirer ""is fabricated.""","George Clooney, the renowned Oscar-winning actor, is reportedly under investigation by the FBI for alleged money laundering. According to the National Enquirer, Clooney has been implicated in an FBI probe after presenting his astonished dinner party guests with an astonishing gift of $1 million in cash, carefully concealed within a luxurious designer bag. The publication has revealed that a secretive government investigation surrounds the ""Money Monster"" actor and the extravagant dinner party that gave rise to it. Sources suggest that this lavish event was organized to commemorate the resounding success of Clooney's own tequila brand, Casamigos.

The article goes on to describe Clooney's generous nature and his strong desire to distribute his wealth. Allegedly, the actor intended to inject an element of surprise and amusement among his attendees, aware that such a grandiose gesture of handing out $1 million in cash to each guest would prompt curiosity and perhaps some awkwardness when depositing the money in the bank. The insider claims that the depositor would have inevitably invited scrutiny from the FBI, who would have been called in for questioning. In an effort to corroborate these claims, the source emphasizes that Clooney undoubtedly arranged the party and bestowed upon each guest both the substantial sum of money and an elegant designer bag as a memento.

Regrettably, these circumstances pose a significant challenge for George Clooney at this particular moment in life. With the impending arrival of his twins and the inevitable association with government investigators, this additional burden is far from ideal. However, it is crucial to note that Gossip Cop, a reputable source, has debunked all the aforementioned allegations. According to their investigation, there is no genuine FBI probe, scandal, or any indication that Clooney has attracted federal attention. The representative of the esteemed ""Ocean's Eleven"" star has categorically stated that the story, as presented by the National Enquirer, is completely fabricated.",rewrite_generation

If that doesn’t earn a second chance, nothing will. So we’re tucked in at a small table under the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted a soft green. There’s a candle in a wax-crusted wine bottle on the table and high-class jazz standards on the sound system.  For the moment, it feels like we’re not in Dublin. We could be in a city anywhere and lucky enough to find a place we’ll remember fondly when we get home.

Dinner for two, with sherries a","The importance of unplanned experiences should not be underestimated, as they can often surpass our expectations. This is precisely why St Valentine's Day fails to resonate with those who possess sound judgement. The act of designating a specific day for romance is as delightful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon.

Unbeknownst to us, our spontaneous decision to venture out to Stanley's on St Andrew's Street in Dublin, rather than our usual spot, is unfolding downstairs in the cozy wine bar. Having dined here previously and enjoyed it, except for the slight oversalting of the fish, I am giving it a second chance, which is not something I offer freely.

However, two events occurred after my previous review that altered my perspective. Firstly, a gentleman seated at the adjacent table contacted me to express his love for Stanley's. He had no personal interest in the matter and spoke purely from the standpoint of an experienced diner within the city. Secondly, I discovered that the chef and co-owner, Stephen McArdle, had a more significant responsibility than attending to my dinner that night; his son had been born mere hours before.

Given these circumstances, it is only fair to grant Stanley's another opportunity to impress. As we settle at a small table beneath the gently sloping ceiling, the soft green walls and a candle flickering within a wax-crusted wine bottle set a serene ambiance. The sound system fills the air with refined jazz standards, momentarily transporting us outside the confines of Dublin. It feels as though we have stumbled upon a hidden gem, a place that will be fondly remembered long after we return home.

The menu is elegantly inscribed on the wall, and Liam, my dining companion, has already ordered a serving of cod croquettes. These delicately encased balls of fluffy fish, enveloped in a crispy outer layer, rest upon a small pool of velvety house-made mayonnaise.

The star of Stanley's is, without a doubt, the sommelier, Morgan Vanderkamer. The word ""sommelier"" often carries certain negative connotations, bringing to mind pretentious individuals intent on upselling guests to exorbitantly priced wines. However, Vanderkamer has successfully eradicated such theatrics from her role and strives to broaden one's horizons when it comes to pairing beverages with food. If you once believed that sherry was solely reserved for the elderly or those seeking to appear sophisticated, Vanderkamer's expertise will undoubtedly change your perspective. Thus, we find ourselves savoring glasses of ice-cold manzanilla, expertly complementing the delicate cod croquettes. We are undoubtedly in capable hands.

The main highlight of our evening is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. Opting for an oloroso, a ruby-hued sherry imbued with depth and character derived from time and aging, we consult Vanderkamer, who advises us that two options are available. One is good, while the other is deemed ""amazing"" and carries a corresponding price tag. With a €16 plate of delectable fare shared between us, we decide to indulge in the extraordinary oloroso, priced at €13 per glass. It proves to be a wise choice.

The €16 charcuterie plate offers a delightful assortment of flavors reminiscent of a small farmyard. Generous slices of duck ham, exuding a delicate smokiness and succulence, find their perfect match in the accompanying apricot puree. The sharpness of the pickled gherkins harmonizes with the ""bacon and cabbage,"" a delectable ham hock terrine encased in vibrant green savoy cabbage leaves. Two delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, exquisitely delicate to the point of dissolving upon contact with the tongue, are uplifted by a pear and vanilla sauce served in a petite ramekin, elevating the sweetness of the liver to even greater decadence.

As if the charcuterie plate were not enough (which it certainly is), we have also ordered a plate of bean and chorizo stew. The supposed ""beans"" are, in fact, chickpeas, and in my opinion, this substituti",rewrite_generation

It’s been rumored for weeks that the 41-year-old had plans to purchase Cecil B. DeMille’s historic mansion, and now, she’s bit the bullet, putting down a $25 million offer, according to TMZ. The amount was reportedly accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow.  Cecil’s home, which he lived in until his death in 1959, is considered one of the greatest properties in L.A., and Angie will have some famous neighbors, including Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman and Ellen Pompeo. There’s tons of space for the six kids, too — the house boasts 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, plus a spacious backyard.  This huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53. The possibility of that big move happening seemed even more likely after reports surfaced on April 12 that Angie had met and fallen in love with a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.  The actress is reportedly already serious with this mystery man, and a family friend told InTouch that she’s even planning on marrying him! However, we also know that Brad and Angie’s divorce has been much more amicable recently, and she’s been letting him spend more and more time with the kids. Perhaps staying in Los Angeles is her way of making sure Pax, Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox continue to have a relationship with their father?

Amidst rumors that the actress is marrying a British businessman, she’s put permanent roots down in California by purchasing the massive Cecil B. DeMille estate — check out pics of the lavish mansion here.  Angelina Jolie, 41, has a new home in Los Angeles…and it’s stunning. It’s been rumored for weeks that the 41-year-old had plans to purchase Cecil B. DeMille’s historic mansion, and now, she’s bit the bullet, putting down a $25 million offer, according to TMZ. The amount was reportedly accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow.  Cecil’s home, which he lived in until his death in 1959, is considered one of the greatest properties in L.A., and Angie will have some famous neighbors, including Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman and Ellen Pompeo. There’s tons of space for the six kids, too — the house boasts 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, plus a spacious backyard.  This huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53. The possibility of that big move happening seemed even more likely after reports surfaced on April 12 that Angie had met and fallen in love with a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.  The actress is reportedly already serious with this mystery man, and a family friend told InTouch that she’s even planning on marrying him! However, we also know that Brad and Angie’s divorce has been much more amicable recently, and she’s been letting him spend more and more time with the kids. Perhaps staying in Los Angeles is her way of making sure Pax, Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox continue to have a relationship with their father? Either way, the house is insane — check it out in the gallery above.  HollywoodLifers, what do you think of Angelina’s new house? Do you think she’s prepping for a wedding?","Angelina Jolie, 41, has recently acquired a new residence in Los Angeles worth a staggering $25 million. Speculations surrounding her alleged marriage to a British businessman have coincided with the purchase of the Cecil B. DeMille estate, a historic mansion with a remarkable reputation within the Californian real estate scene. The renowned property, formerly inhabited by Cecil B. DeMille until his passing in 1959, holds a prominent status in Los Angeles. Notably, esteemed individuals such as Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman, and Ellen Pompeo reside in this exclusive neighborhood, thus augmenting Ms. Jolie's prestigious company. Additionally, the vast mansion offers considerable space for her six children, featuring six bedrooms, ten bathrooms, and a commodious backyard. This substantial investment follows rumors of Ms. Jolie's potential relocation to London, envisaging a new working environment since her separation from Brad Pitt in September 2016. Reports emerged on April 12 indicating a blossoming romance with an undisclosed British philanthropist and businessman, further fueling speculation of an impending marriage. Simultaneously, recent developments have showcased a more harmonious dynamic between Ms. Jolie and Mr. Pitt as she has allowed him more access to their children. It is plausible that her decision to stay in Los Angeles is an effort to ensure that their children - Pax, Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne, and Knox - maintain a strong relationship with their father. Whether wedding preparations are underway or not, the grandeur and opulence of the mansion are undeniable. Explore the elegance of the property in the accompanying gallery.

Or so goes the advice Liam Payne is apparently following from Zayn: He’s the last to venture out on his own and the first to come out burning a bridge he still has to cross when it’s all said and done. On Liam’s first single, “Strip That Down,” he’s dissed One Direction plain as day. “You know I used to be in 1D, now I’m out free,” he sings. “People want me for one thing, that’s not me. I’m not changing the way that I used to be, I just want to have fun and get rowdy.”    But with nearly all remaining members of One Direction releasing new music of their own within weeks of each other, this song is not the only opportunity Payne has had to make his thoughts on his bandmates known. Speaking with Music Choice, he complimented Niall Horan’s new singles, but Harry Styles, not so much. “I’ll be honest with you, it’s not my sort of music. It’s not something I’d listen to,” he said. But he did have a quick save: “I think he did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. That’s the way I’d put it best, I think.” Liam also noted that Harry would probably say the same about his music since Harry doesn’t listen to hip-hop. “My song’s more ‘Rack City’ and his song is more of a different era to something I’d listen to, I guess,” he said. “Strip That Down” does feature a rapper, Migos’s Quavo, but a redux of the only song of note that Tyga has ever made it is not.",1,en,"Oh boy.

In this song, he addresses his departure from the group, highlighting his desire to express his true self and have a more liberated musical journey. While some might interpret his lyrics as a diss towards his former bandmates, it is crucial to remember that artists often explore new genres and styles during their solo careers to discover their own artistic identities.

However, it is not only in his music that Payne has expressed his thoughts on his fellow bandmates. When asked about Niall Horan's new singles, he spoke highly of them and appreciated Horan's artistic choices. In contrast, he mentioned that Harry Styles' music was not his personal taste, but acknowledged that Styles had successfully pursued his own artistic vision. Payne explained that their musical preferences differ, with Styles inclined towards genres other than hip-hop, which is the main inspiration behind his own song.

It is important to analyze Payne's music and interviews in a fair and open-minded manner, understanding that artists have the right to explore and evolve their artistry. While ""Strip That Down"" includes features from renowned rapper Quavo, it is not an attempt to replicate any specific artist's work. Payne's intention is to showcase his unique style, which draws inspiration from hip-hop culture and creates a distinct sound.

With each member of One Direction now pursuing individual music careers, it is natural for them to explore different genres and musical directions. Liam Payne's solo endeavors should be evaluated based on his own artistic growth and the ability to carve out his own path in the music industry.",rewrite_generation

gossipcop-4796409702,"Kim Kardashian is allegedly “phasing out” mom Kris Jenner, particularly when it comes to her responsibilities as her longtime manager, amid reports Kim is ready for a total image overhaul after returning to the spotlight following her October robbery.  That’s according to a new report by Radar Online, who’s claiming that the mother-daughter duo could be caught in a nasty feud as a source alleged that Kardashian has had somewhat of an epiphany during her time away from the spotlight and allegedly has now opened her eyes to see how Jenner “used her” to build the Kardashian brand.  According to the site, Kim is ready to project a very different image from the uber-glamorous money flaunting Kardashian fans used to know and is allegedly ready to kick mom Kris to the curb, at least professionally, in order to do so.  A source alleged to the site this week that Kim now “seems to be thinking that Kris used her to get where she is today,” which Radar Online is alleging could have led to a nasty feud between Jenner and her daughter as well as the reality star reportedly making a pretty big business decision when it comes to her mom.  “[Kim] will never think of [Kris] in the same way again,” the source said of Jenner’s supposed drama with her daughter amid reports she believes Jenner has been “using” her for years.  The site then went on to report that Kim is now in the process of projecting her new toned-down image amid the feud claims with Kris, revealing that Jenner may no longer play such a big part in Kardashian’s career going forward.  “Kim hired a transition team to make sure that she gives off a different image than she did previously,” the source said of Jenner and her daughter potentially parting ways professionally, claiming that “part of this process includes phasing out [Kris’s] management.”  While Kris and Kim have not commented on the claims, this isn’t the first time it’s been reported that Kardashian may be looking to distance herself from Jenner, at least professionally, in the wake of her October robbery in Paris.  Radar Online claimed back in October that Kim Kardashian had grown wise to Kris Jenner’s “money making machine” after taking some downtime at the end of 2016, alleging at the time that Kim has been so busy with her career that she’s failed to realize how much Jenner, who is often referred to as her “momager,” had been controlling her life and career.  “Kim never realized how much [Kris] and the money-making machine was controlling her until this robbery,” an insider told the site of Kardashian’s feelings about Jenner at the time, months before it was reported that the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is allegedly looking to “phase out” Kris from her career.  “Kim is just starting to think that maybe Kris’s intentions were not pure all along,” continued the source in October, adding that Kim has been doing a lot of thinking about her father Robert Kardashian while taking some time away which has allegedly helped her to get wise to Kris’s seemingly relentless pursuit of fame for herself and her family.  “[Kim] told her family that she wanted to be the girl that her father wanted her to be and not the girl that she became with Kris’s help,” a source revealed last year, just months before it was reported that a feud could be brewing between Kardashian and Jenner.

What do you think of reports claiming Kim Kardashian and mom Kris Jenner could be caught in a feud amid claims Kim is attempting to “phase out” her mother’s management?  [Featured Image by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images]","According to a recent report by Radar Online, there is speculation that Kim Kardashian is making significant changes in her professional relationship with her mother, Kris Jenner. Apparently, Kim has been reflecting on her time away from the spotlight, specifically after her robbery in October, and has come to the realization that Jenner may have used her to further the Kardashian brand. This alleged epiphany has prompted Kim to seek a different image for herself, one that differs from the extravagant and money-driven persona she has been known for. As a result, she is said to be distancing herself from her mother both personally and professionally.

An anonymous source claimed to Radar Online that Kim no longer sees her mother in the same light, believing that Jenner manipulated the situation to her advantage. This revelation has allegedly sparked a potential feud between the two, leading Kim to make a significant business decision regarding her mother's involvement in her career. Although both Kris and Kim have yet to comment on these rumors, it is not the first time that Kim has been reported to consider distancing herself from her mother, at least on a professional level.

In October of last year, Radar Online reported that Kim had become aware of what they referred to as Kris Jenner's ""money making machine."" This awareness supposedly came about during Kim's downtime at the end of 2016, revealing that she had been oblivious to how much control Jenner had exerted over her life and career. At the time, an insider revealed that the robbery in Paris served as a wake-up call for Kim, leading her to question her mother's true intentions. The source explained that Kim had been contemplating her late father, Robert Kardashian, during her time away, which ultimately shed light on Jenner's seemingly relentless pursuit of fame for herself and the family.

While it remains uncertain whether these claims hold any truth, Radar Online has also reported that Kim has hired a team to guide her through a transformation process aimed at projecting a more subdued image. As a part of this change, it is suggested that Jenner's role in Kim's career may be diminished.

It is essential to note that neither Kim nor Kris has addressed these alleged disputes. However, the possibility of a feud arising between the two is causing speculation among fans and observers alike.",rewrite_generation

Kelly also stated that Jesus was a white man later in the segment.[33] Soon after, Jon Stewart,[34] Stephen Colbert,[35] Rachel Maddow,[36] Josh Barro,[37] and others satirized her remarks.[38] Two days later, she made additional on-air statements, characterizing her original comments as ""tongue-in-cheek"",[39][40][41][42][43] and that the skin color of Jesus is ""far from settled"".[44] In June 2015, Kelly interviewed Jim Bob Duggar and Michelle Duggar of 19 Kids and Counting regarding their son Josh Duggar's alleged molestation of five girls in 2002.

The news follows reports that the 37-year-old reality star is expecting her fourth child, although it remains unclear whether the father is her ex-boyfriend Scott Disick or the younger boxer-model Younes Bendjima. 

Kourtney and Justin were seen together at The Peppermint Club in Hollywood while Scott accompanied Kourtney's sister, Kim Kardashian, on her trip to Dubai. It appears that Scott's behavior during the trip caused some tension, as he went missing without informing anyone of his whereabouts. It was his responsibility to ensure Kim's safety, but he had apparently overslept for a whopping ten hours. 

These recent events are somewhat surprising, as Scott and Kourtney had just reconciled their relationship last month. However, their history together suggests that this type of drama is not altogether unexpected. 

Kourtney and Justin were first seen together in December 2015 at The Nice Guy, followed by a night out at a karaoke club. Reports claim that Kourtney was seen leaving one of Justin's favorite hotels, the Montage Beverly Hills, at 4 a.m. the next morning. Scott, who is the father of Kourtney's three children, was understandably upset about their involvement. Kourtney herself admits to regretting the entire affair and not heeding her instincts.

gossipcop-3967904178,"Watch Entertainment Tonight on Yahoo View.  Music’s odd couple, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton — aka the rocker and the country boy — have never been free of gossip speculating about their relationship. Apparently, the latest news is that the two are through. In Touch Weekly reports that Shelton actually unceremoniously dumped Stefani in February before embarking on a tour.  But wait — if that’s the case, then why is Stefani appearing with him on stage? And not just appearing … they’re appearing pretty cuddly. The singer posted an Instagram shot on Mar. 14 of the two embracing on what appears to be the most recent date of his “Country Music Freaks” trek.      This isn’t the first such picture she has shared since February. She posted several different angles of a jumbotron kiss on Feb. 25, and on March 11, one of herself hanging out with country up-and-comer Carly Pearce, who is an opener on Shelton’s tour, and another that shows off a backstage crowd (including Shelton and her younger brother Todd) in Greensboro, N.C.      Additionally, she sent good wishes to him on Mar. 1 — when Shelton was reportedly attempting to power through a Houston date while sick with the flu — and shared his latest video, “I Lived It” with a glowing string of hashtags.      So if the breakup is fake news, what spurred the rumors? According to In Touch‘s “insider” source, all of Stefani’s social media support is “a desperate attempt to ignore the truth,” and Shelton dumped her due to her “neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband, and her jealousy of him and other women.”  If this is to be believed, current Voice champion Chloe Kohanski was a factor in the breakup — Coach Shelton was apparently getting too close for Stefani’s comfort — as well as Shelton’s ex-wife Miranda Lambert, with whom the outlet claims he has rekindled a friendship and is “sharing intimate details” of his life.  Shelton isn’t reciprocating Stefani’s loving social media deluge — but then again, he’s never been one to do so. His social media accounts, once a source of ribald jokes, have developed gradually into a more businesslike platform to market his music and work on The Voice.

gossipcop-1634815619,"California is “the darkest state in the Union,” according to country singer Dolly Parton, who claims that the state has been hit with a series of “Biblical disasters” in recent times as punishment for “embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Parton predicted Los Angeles will suffer a similar fate to Sodom and Gomorrah, the Biblical cities synonymous with vice, darkness and impenitent sin.  “California just keeps on being hit by disaster after disaster as foretold in the Bible,” the Grammy Award-winning entertainer and businesswoman told guests at Dolly Parton’s Stampede, a dinner and entertainment evening.  “Pestilence, and epidemics, and crime, and disease. And you know what? They don’t even realize what is happening to them. They are so corrupted, they can’t even see what is right in front of their eyes.”  “First they had the drought that lasted years and years, killing off billions and billions of dollars in crops, and making the soil so incredibly dry that a large rainstorm could easily turn into a major flood.  “Then they had the fires. Awful, awful fires. Historical, deadly fires. Thousands lost their homes, scores lost their lives and their livelihoods. Did you know the Thomas fire is still burning? In the winter!“  “And now they just had dozens of homes destroyed by mudslides,” Tennessee-born Parton said, making reference to the mudslides that have killed 15 people, with the toll expected to climb above 30. The mudslide hit an affluent part of California, and damaged Oprah Winfrey’s house.  “When they get hit with the ‘Big One‘, Parton said, referencing the popular name for the super quake expected to rock California in the future, “then we will know that the End Times have truly begun.”  “And don’t forget the sexual abuse scandals rocking Hollywood. They are being punished for embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Is California suffering from bad weather and bad luck, or is Parton right?

Parton attributes these challenges to the state's alleged embrace of Satan and rejection of God. During a recent gathering at Dolly Parton's Stampede, a dinner and entertainment event, the Grammy Award-winning entertainer and businesswoman expressed her concern for California's ongoing misfortunes. She forewarned that Los Angeles might even face a fate similar to that of Sodom and Gomorrah, cities associated in the Bible with vice, darkness, and unrepentant sin.

Parton expressed that California seems oblivious to the succession of calamities befalling them, including pests, epidemics, crime, and disease. She emphasized how the state's corruption has blinded its inhabitants to the evident turmoil. Parton discussed the prolonged drought that devastated their crops and rendered the soil excessively dry, increasing the potential for significant flooding during heavy rainstorms. She also lamented the devastating and historically unprecedented fires that have decimated countless homes and lives, highlighting the continuing Thomas fire that defies the usual expectations by persisting into winter. Additionally, she referred to the recent mudslides resulting in the destruction of numerous homes, with a rising death toll that has already claimed 15 lives, and expected to surpass 30. Notably, these mudslides impacted an affluent area of California, even damaging Oprah Winfrey's house.

Parton went on to speculate that when California eventually experiences the anticipated ""Big One,"" a massive earthquake that might strike the state, it would be a sign of the beginning of the End Times. She also mentioned the ongoing sexual abuse scandals in Hollywood, suggesting that these issues further support her belief that California is facing divine retribution for its alleged adherence to Satan and rejection of God.

While contemplating whether California's misfortunes are a result of bad weather and sheer bad luck or if Dolly Parton's claim holds some truth, it is essential to note that Parton herself has previously stated that she considers herself an entertainer and refrains from engaging in politics. At the previous year's Emmys, when Parton shared the stage with Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda, the latter two took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump. However, Parton chose to maintain her dignified silence, honoring her commitment to her role as an entertainer.",rewrite_generation

Jennifer and Jason previously starred together in the 2010 comedy-drama, The Switch, as well as the 2011 comedy, Horrible Bosses, and its 2014 sequel, Horrible Bosses 2.

In their statement announcing their split, Jennifer and Justin expressed their desire to minimize further speculation. They acknowledged that while they preferred to handle this issue privately, they felt compelled to share the truth directly due to the media's inclination to speculate and fabricate stories. They emphasized the importance of preserving the deep respect and love they have for one another, noting that anything else written about them is a fictional narrative created by someone else.

Jennifer and Justin became engaged in August 2012, after starring together in the 2012 comedy, Wanderlust. They tied the knot in August 2015 but do not have children together. Justin recently mentioned in an interview that he was not with Jennifer on her birthday in February, and would not be spending Valentine's Day with her. Prior to marrying Justin, Jennifer was famously married to Brad Pitt from 2000 to 2005. Her notable works include the TV sitcom Friends, as well as films such as Office Christmas Party, Cake, and Marley & Me.",rewrite_generation

Published on the World News Today YouTube Channel on December 2, 2017, the video features a scripted voice alleging that Rihanna expressed her belief that prayers to Jesus are ineffective and advised the audience to turn to Satan instead. These claims, however, have been proven false.

The Prime Minister of Barbados, Rt. Hon. Freundel Stuart, attended the event on the mentioned date and conferred the title of Cultural Ambassador on Rihanna. During her speech, the Grammy-award winner focused on inspiring children and individuals to believe in their dreams and have faith in God. She shared her own experience of growing up in Bridgetown and emphasized the importance of hard work and determination. Contrary to the allegations made in the video, Rihanna spoke about the power of faith and maintained that her success was a result of her unwavering belief in her dreams.

It is worth mentioning that numerous reputable sources, including Loop News, were present at the event and recorded Rihanna's speech. The video posted on YouTube has been widely discredited, with many viewers expressing skepticism and calling for proof of the fabricated statements attributed to Rihanna. The ceremony itself was broadcast live on television in Barbados, providing tens of thousands of viewers the opportunity to witness Rihanna's genuine words.

It is essential to be cautious when encountering false information, especially in today's era of widespread misinformation. By referring to reliable sources and verifying the accuracy of claims, we can avoid falling for deceptive narratives. In the case of Rihanna's speech, it is clear that the video circulating online does not accurately represent her beliefs or the message she imparted during the event.",rewrite_generation

Lohan, 31, wore a hijab to the event, which showcased the latest styles in hijabs, abayas, and long hemlines. With her signature flame hair peeking through, the headpiece perfectly framed her face, accented by a touch of lip gloss and eyebrow pencil. She paired the hijab with a black bomber jacket and trousers as she explored the cosmetics on display. Lindsay Lohan was seen posing with excited fans before quietly leaving the event. A beauty brand from the event later praised Lohan for her interest in halal cosmetics and confirmed that she was wearing halal makeup that day.

Running alongside London Fashion Week, London Modest Fashion Week is an annual event that features modest clothing designs such as scarves, hijabs, and loose-fitting maxi dresses. With over 40 designers from around the world participating, the event has become a platform for the rapidly expanding consumer market of modest fashion. The two-day event, held at Victoria House, Bloomsbury, offers shopping, runway shows, talks, and workshops, including a 'sharia legal hub'.

In January, Lohan changed her Instagram bio to 'Alaikum salam', an Arabic greeting meaning 'and unto you peace.' This gesture led to assumptions that she may be converting to Islam. However, Lohan herself has not confirmed these rumors, and her representative did not respond to DailyMail.com's request for comment. In 2015, Lohan sparked similar speculations when she was photographed holding a copy of the Quran during community service in Brooklyn. Lohan later clarified that the Quran was a gift from her Saudi friends in London and that she was simply learning about the religion. She faced backlash and criticism for this incident, leading her to express feeling unsafe in her own country and seek refuge in London.

Despite the controversies surrounding her interest in Islam, Lohan continues to focus on her work and philanthropy. She recently visited child refugees who had fled Syria and crossed into Turkey. Lohan expressed her desire to return to Turkey and help those in need, emphasizing that no terrorist attack can deter her from her mission. In January 2017, just days before deleting all her Instagram posts, Lohan shared a poem expressing her desire to ""fix ISIS minds."" These words reflect the complexities of her thoughts and her determination to make a positive impact in the world.

Lindsay Lohan remains a prominent figure in both the entertainment industry and humanitarian efforts. Her choices, such as wearing a hijab at London Modest Fashion Week, spark discussions and intrigue about her personal beliefs. Ultimately, the American actress keeps her religious views private, leaving many to wonder about the true meaning behind her actions.",rewrite_generation

Each sister is facing their own set of challenges and relationship difficulties during this time. Kylie, at the age of 20 and approximately five months pregnant, is expecting her child with her boyfriend, Travis Scott. Khloé, at the age of 33, is pregnant with her first child with NBA player Tristan Thompson, who is 26 years old. Kim, 37, and her husband Kanye West, 40, are expecting their third child this winter through a surrogate. According to exclusive sources, all three sisters are grappling with issues such as lack of commitment, disinterest, different priorities, and selfish behavior. Despite the excitement surrounding the arrival of three babies, the sisters are currently facing emotional turmoil in their personal lives.

Insiders close to the Kardashians have disclosed that this should be a joyous time for the sisters, yet their love lives are in shambles. Fortunately, Kris Jenner has assured her daughters that she will be there to support them through any circumstances that may arise.

gossipcop-2682199068,"Reverend Swadley – the local wedding priest and friend of the Pitt family – has confirmed to friends that the A-list couple recently spent a week with Brad’s family, discussing detailed plans for a wedding.  It’s believed the loved-up stars had flown to Missouri because Jen was desperate to reconnect with Brad’s mum, Jane, who she’d developed a very close bond with throughout the time of their first marriage.  During the seven-day visit, it’s been revealed that Jane orchestrated a meeting with the family priest Reverend Swadley – hoping it would be the gentle push Brad and Jen would need to make their reignited relationship official once again.  ‘Reverend Swadley met Jen recently at a family function that Brad’s mum, Jane, threw at their family home in Missouri,’ a close friend of the pastor’s told New Idea exclusively.  ‘Jen accompanied Brad home on the trip and attended church services with the family as well as joining Brad at meetings at the now-retired reverend’s home, who Brad reconnected with after he decided to find himself and renew his faith, following his split from Ange.  ‘He remarked at how at ease Jen was with his family, who clearly adore her, and how everyone said how much she’s been missed and how happy they all were to have her back in Brad’s – and their – lives.’  The source goes on to reveal that Reverend Swadley spoke at length with Brad and Jen about getting married as soon as possible, in Missouri, in a small ceremony, with just local friends and family present.  ‘Reverend Swadley revealed how in love Brad and Jen were and how they planned to officially wed as soon as their divorces were finalised, with him agreeing to conduct the ceremony and welcome them both back into the church,’ the friend of the pastor told New Idea.  Reverend Swadley revealed to our source that it was clear Jen loved seeing Brad’s family again, spending long days talking and laughing for the first time since their 2005 divorce.  ‘Jen spent five days reconnecting with Brad’s parents, brother and sister and many of his childhood friends who he remains close to,’ a friend of the pastor reveals.  Brad Pitt's parents are nothing but supportive Getty  ‘He said Jen kept saying how grateful she was that they’d been brought back together. And how they’ll both be baptised later this year before they officially wed – with Jen’s father, John, vowing to be at her side for the service and give her away again at their wedding, which will hopefully take place shortly after and be far more low-key than their original star-studded nuptials in Malibu.’  It’s the latest chapter in the pair’s rekindled romance since Jen announced her split from estranged husband Justin Theroux in February. She has wasted no time in rebuilding her relationship with ex-husband Brad, spending time with his six children, and developing a unique and special bond with his 11-year-old daughter Shiloh.  It’s that close relationship between Jen and his kids that has prompted Brad to want to marry Jen as soon as soon as possible.  ‘Brad’s mum Jane was all over them to get married as soon as possible, but the truth is Brad needs no convincing,’ says a source close to Brad. ‘They still want to keep this relationship close to their chest and out of the public eye, but behind closed doors they couldn’t be happier.  ‘And for Brad, seeing how much his children – especially Shiloh – love Jen has just made his heart soar.

During this week-long stay, they engaged in detailed discussions with Brad's family regarding their future wedding plans. The main reason for their visit was Jen's strong desire to reconnect with Brad's mother, Jane, with whom she had formed a close bond during their previous marriage. Jane, taking the initiative, arranged a meeting between the couple and Reverend Swadley, who hoped that his presence and guidance would encourage Brad and Jen to formalize their reignited relationship. According to a reliable source close to the pastor, Jen accompanied Brad on this trip, attending church services and participating in meetings with the family at Reverend Swadley's residence. This reunion allowed Jen to easily integrate herself with Brad's family, who clearly hold her in high regard. Their delight in having Jen back in their lives was evident. Reverend Swadley, in long discussions with both Brad and Jen, expressed his support for their desire to marry as soon as their divorces are finalized. He agreed to officiate at their wedding and warmly welcome them back into the church. Our insider revealed that Jen genuinely enjoyed reconnecting with Brad's parents, siblings, and childhood friends during her five-day stay. The close bond that she has developed with Brad's 11-year-old daughter Shiloh was particularly heartwarming. Looking ahead, Jen and Brad plan on being baptized together before their official wedding ceremony, which they hope will occur later this year. Jen's father, John, has expressed his commitment to be by her side during the service and give her away again. This event is expected to be more intimate compared to their previous high-profile wedding in Malibu. This latest development in their rekindled relationship comes after Jen's separation from her estranged husband, Justin Theroux, in February. She wasted no time in nurturing her connection with Brad, spending time with his six children and forming a distinctive bond with Shiloh. This close relationship, especially Shiloh's affection for Jen, has solidified Brad's desire to marry her as soon as possible. While Brad's mother, Jane, has been fervently encouraging them to wed expeditiously, the source close to Brad assures us that he requires no further persuasion. Both Brad and Jen intend to keep their relationship private but are overjoyed with their current situation. They are determined to finalize their divorces promptly so that they may walk down the aisle together in Missouri before the year concludes. Their future as spouses is the only thing they genuinely desire. For the complete account, refer to the latest edition of New Idea, available now.",rewrite_generation

In a recent conversation with Cosmopolitan, Kunis admitted, with an air of serene detachment, that she consciously avoids engaging with any content pertaining to her own persona. She remains blissfully unaware of the narratives that circulate, apart from a recurring theme that she humorously acknowledges – her alleged annual bouts of pregnancy and impending divorce. These, she claims, somewhat playfully, catch her eye as she peruses the aisles of the local grocery store, casually reminding her of the media's continued fascination with her personal life.

In contrast to her resolute indifference, Kunis reveals that her family members grapple with a more profound impact from these headlines. She explains that her parents and grandparents, on occasion, find themselves bewildered by the unfounded stories they encounter, believing some of them to be true. The distress caused by a particularly distressing incident remains etched in Kunis' memory; during her pregnancy, a fabricated emergency propelled her face onto the cover of tabloids. The anguish inflicted upon her loved ones as a result of this fictional tale is something she solemnly attests to, acknowledging that such grievances are truly understood only by those who have experienced them.

Despite the weighty toll that these false narratives exact on her family, Kunis offers a lighthearted anecdote to shift the tone. As a mother to a three-year-old daughter named Wyatt and a one-year-old son named Dimitri, both whom she shares with her husband Ashton Kutcher, she playfully reveals her father's endearing hope that such pregnancy headlines bear an element of truth.

Stephen King asks PATHETIC question about Obama, gets CLOBBERED by Conservatives  Chelsea Clinton coverage on Twitchy","The National Enquirer's credibility has been called into question recently, particularly by David Frum who suggests that Megyn Kelly need not be overly concerned about the tabloid. Frum points out that the publication has been known to endorse outlandish theories, such as the belief that Elvis Presley is still alive or that Ted Cruz's father played a role in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Considering this track record, it is understandable why many people do not take the National Enquirer seriously. Frum also draws attention to other news outlets like The New York Times and The Washington Post, suggesting that they too have their own biases and should not be considered impartial sources. Interestingly, Chelsea Clinton attempts to bond with Kelly over the National Enquirer controversy, sarcastically welcoming her to the ""club"" by referencing other outrageous stories the tabloid has published in the past. However, some followers of Chelsea Clinton react negatively to her attempt at camaraderie, criticizing Kelly for her past support of and vote for Donald Trump. The negative reaction highlights the divisive political atmosphere and the difficulty in finding common ground. It is clear that the National Enquirer and its association with Kelly will continue to spark heated debate among audiences with differing views.",rewrite_generation

In an upcoming nude photo shoot, Jenner plans to showcase her new identity, marking a significant milestone since publicly announcing her transition in 2015. While the Kardashian-Jenner family has expressed overall support for Jenner's journey, sources close to them have revealed their concerns and reservations regarding the prospect of a nude shoot.

News of the planned photo shoot reached the Kardashian-Jenner clan through Jenner's son, Brody, who is a model. According to an insider, the family was taken aback by the announcement, considering it to be an extreme step. They expressed their discomfort with the notion, hoping that it would not come to fruition, as they perceived it to be a nightmare scenario. Kris Jenner, the matriarch of the family, who was aware of Jenner's surgery in advance, has reportedly taken it upon herself to prevent the shoot from occurring.

DailyMail.com has reached out to representatives for both Jenner and the Kardashians for their comments on the matter. Thus far, Jenner's spokesperson claims to have no knowledge of the situation. It is worth mentioning that Jenner's transition has already caused some tensions within the family, particularly with her step-daughter, Kim Kardashian, in relation to the headline-making Vanity Fair spread. Despite this, the family has chosen to publicly support Jenner's decision to transition, a process that was concluded in January, as revealed from leaked excerpts of her memoir.

Jenner, in her book co-authored by Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, discusses her feelings of liberation and newfound authenticity following the successful surgery, which cost approximately $20,000. She expresses her excitement and enthusiasm for life, emphasizing that this represents a significant turning point after living for almost two-thirds of her life without true self-fulfillment since her Olympic achievements. However, the publication of the memoir has strained Jenner's relationships with her former wife and step-children. Sources close to the family indicate that Jenner's behavior has also been erratic, further contributing to the current estrangement.

The leaked excerpts from the memoir have led to additional embarrassment for Jenner. Most notably, she claims that the late Robert Kardashian had knowledge of O.J. Simpson's guilt in the murder of Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman, a revelation that has stirred controversy. Kardashian, who was a member of Simpson's legal defense team during the trial, was the father of Kourtney, Khloe, Kim, and Rob Kardashian.

In summary, Caitlyn Jenner's planned nude photo shoot represents a significant milestone in her journey following gender reassignment surgery. While the Kardashian-Jenner family has generally been supportive, the idea of the shoot has sparked concerns and reservations among them. Kris Jenner has reportedly taken measures to prevent the shoot from happening. The family awaits further clarification from Jenner's representatives. The publication of Jenner's memoir has strained her relationships with her former spouse and step-children, and certain revelations from the book have caused additional controversy.",rewrite_generation

But, intrepid journalists, who are paid to ferret out the truth, discovered what was the word, and they printed it – minus the offending syllable, of course.  All hell broke loose.  Trump called Colbert “no-talent guy.” Colbert’s monologue was plastered by some as inappropriately vulgar, by others as homophobic. The FCC received thousands of complaints. Reporters breathlessly reported Colbert was under FCC investigation, and a good time was had by all.

During the show, Colbert responded to President Donald Trump's on-air insults towards CBS News-man John Dickerson by delivering a series of increasingly explicit insults. Colbert's remarks reached their peak when he stated that the only purpose of Trump's mouth was to act as Vladimir Putin's [expletive] holster. While the offensive word was censored on the broadcast and Colbert's mouth was pixelated, investigative journalists managed to uncover the word and published it, albeit without the offending syllable.

As a result, chaos ensued. Trump referred to Colbert as a ""no-talent guy,"" and some criticized Colbert's monologue as vulgar, while others labeled it as homophobic. The FCC was inundated with thousands of complaints, and reporters eagerly reported on the investigation into Colbert's actions, which brought great amusement to many.

However, today, the FCC has put an end to the excitement by releasing a statement that reads: ""In line with established procedures, the FCC's Enforcement Bureau thoroughly reviewed the complaints and the content that was the subject of these complaints."" The statement continues, ""The Bureau has determined that there were no violations of the FCC's regulations.""

To clarify, the FCC's rules state that programs airing on broadcast TV stations before 10 PM can face fines if they are considered ""indecent"" by the commission. Late-night shows, however, have a different criterion to meet for potential fines - their content must be deemed ""obscene"" to warrant punishment for the stations. The FCC defines obscene content as material that must appeal to the average person's sexual interest, depict sexual conduct in a plainly offensive manner, and, as a whole, lack significant literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.

Let us know!","Angelina Jolie has recently initiated a divorce from Brad Pitt, but could a reconciliation be on the horizon? According to an exclusive source close to the couple, there is still a possibility of Angelina changing her mind. Despite the turmoil they have faced in the past year, there is still love between them, but it is now up to Brad to reignite that spark.

The source reveals that Angelina has been plagued with regrets about the split and the end of their marriage. During that time, their relationship had become strained with frequent arguments, and Angelina had perceived Brad's detachment. The breakup was surrounded by intense drama and resulted in ill feelings on both sides. However, Angelina is now deeply missing Brad, as he was not just her husband but also her best friend. They shared everything and provided unwavering support to one another. Though Angelina is known for her stubbornness and is unlikely to admit any mistake, she would willingly abandon the divorce if Brad were to come crawling back and plead for another chance.

Is there a possibility for the reformation of Brangelina? Angelina has already expressed her satisfaction with Brad's progress in maintaining his sobriety. However, a report from Life & Style suggests that Brad may not be enthusiastic about the idea of a reunion. On their wedding anniversary, August 23, they chose to avoid dwelling on the sadness of the day, reflecting the current state of their relationship.

HollywoodLife.com has reached out to Angelina's representative for further comment. The question remains: could Angelina and Brad truly make it work? We invite our readers to share their thoughts and insights on the matter.",rewrite_generation

According to New Idea, Witherspoon is supposedly upset with Kidman for not promoting the show adequately before its debut in February. It is claimed that Kidman focused too much on discussing her recent hit film, Lion, during interviews, which left Witherspoon feeling neglected. A source quoted by Daily Mail stated, ""Reese is furious that Nicole hasn't done more to support Big Little Lies. All she talked about in the interviews was Lion. Had Reese known that Nicole would put the show on the back-burner, she would have cast someone else.""

Although the show saw success in Australia, surpassing any other HBO series broadcast on Foxtel during its launch week and even doubling the viewership of Game of Thrones' first-ever episode, New Idea speculates that the lukewarm reception in Kidman's home country has left Witherspoon disappointed. It is worth noting that Witherspoon is one of the executive producers of the show.

The tension between the two allegedly became evident at the Oscars last month, with the source claiming that Kidman even instructed her people to keep Witherspoon away from her. The publication also reported on tense arguments that occurred during filming, suggesting that this might mark the end of their collaborative projects.

However, these claims have been refuted by a representative of Daily Mail Australia, who asserts that everyone involved with Big Little Lies is extremely pleased with the show. They emphasize that Witherspoon and Kidman are great friends who have tremendous respect for one another's work. Furthermore, another source denies New Idea's assertion that Kidman did not promote the show as much as other cast members, stating that she engaged in an extensive amount of publicity both in America and abroad.

It is important to note that just two months ago, Kidman spoke about the strong friendship she shares with Witherspoon, describing them as ""very, very close friends"" who are able to discuss anything openly.",rewrite_generation

As a child, Jolie developed a passion for acting after watching films with her mother. Despite her father's success in the film industry, it was her mother's influence that sparked her interest.

The adoption of her first child provided her with stability and the motivation to overcome her self-destructive tendencies.

Jolie has had a complicated relationship with her father, Jon Voight, stemming from his absence during her early childhood and sporadic interactions throughout their lives.

The girls were just fans of the DNCE frontman, who graciously posed for photos with them on the sunny shoreline. How sweet!

Joe’s brother Nick Jonas even commemorated the occasion by giving a sweet shout-out to the birthday girl. He shared a photo from Sophie and Joe’s engagement party in Nov. 2017, and captioned the pic that also included Kevin and Frankie Jonas, “Happy Birthday @sophiet You’re super cool!

I have let my insecurities get the best of me at times, I let my broken relationships dictate the way I acted toward people and the way I treated them. I let bitterness, jealousy and fear run my life.!!!! ... What I’m not gonna do is be ashamed of my mistakes. I wanna be a man that learns from them and grows from them.!!”  He signed off by apologising for any grammatical errors: “I THINK THERES SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT IMPERFECTIONS!!”  With the tour now finished, the statement closes a chapter of his career.

In a message on Instagram, he has elaborated on his reasons.  “I’ve learned the more you appreciate your calling the more you want to protect your calling,” he wrote. “Me taking this time right now is me saying I want to be SUSTAINABLE... so that I can be the man I want to be, the husband I eventually want to be, and the father I want to be.”  Perhaps referring to the string of fractious incidents he has been involved with, including punching a Spanish fan, driving drunk in a Lamborghini and being banned from China, he added: “Learning and growing hasn’t always been easy but knowing I’m not alone has kept me going. I have let my insecurities get the best of me at times, I let my broken relationships dictate the way I acted toward people and the way I treated them. I let bitterness, jealousy and fear run my life.!!!! ... What I’m not gonna do is be ashamed of my mistakes. I wanna be a man that learns from them and grows from them.!!”  He signed off by apologising for any grammatical errors: “I THINK THERES SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT IMPERFECTIONS!!”  With the tour now finished, the statement closes a chapter of his career. His album Purpose spawned a series of colossal hit singles, including What Do You Mean, Love Yourself, and Sorry, which until recently was the most streamed song of all time globally. It was replaced by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee’s Despacito, which Bieber also features on.  Guardian Service","Justin Bieber has taken the time to provide his fans with an explanation for the cancellation of the remaining shows on his Purpose World Tour. In a heartfelt message shared on Instagram, the renowned artist expressed his desire for his mind, heart, and soul to thrive in a sustainable manner. Following an impressive run of 150 performances in 40 different countries, Bieber made the decision to cancel the final 14 shows, with the intention of taking a break and finding relaxation. 

Bieber acknowledges that his commitment to his calling has given him a newfound appreciation for its protection. By taking this time for himself, he aims to ensure his own sustainability, which will allow him to become the person, husband, and eventually the father he aspires to be. He offers insight into the challenges he has faced, referencing previous incidents such as altercations with fans, driving under the influence, and being barred from China. Despite these difficulties, Bieber finds solace in the knowledge that he is not alone in his journey of growth and learning. Reflecting on his shortcomings, he discloses how insecurity, broken relationships, and negative emotions have impacted his actions and decisions. Yet, he refuses to be burdened by shame and instead strives to evolve as a person, using his mistakes as valuable lessons.

Closing his message with an apology for any grammatical errors, Bieber emphasizes that he finds beauty in imperfections and believes they hold a special significance. With the conclusion of the Purpose World Tour, there is a sense of closure on this chapter of his career. Notably, the album Purpose and its hit singles, such as ""What Do You Mean,"" ""Love Yourself,"" and ""Sorry,"" achieved remarkable success, with ""Sorry"" recently relinquishing its title as the most streamed song globally to Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee’s ""Despacito,"" featuring Bieber as well. 

This statement from Justin Bieber gives fans a deeper understanding of his decision and reflects his sincere commitment to personal growth and well-being.",rewrite_generation

MORE: JENNIFER ANISTON BANS THE WORD “BABY” AROUND HER  Take a look at almost two decades worth of pregnancy rumors and how they progressed:","Not all women desire to have children, and this personal choice should be respected. While individuals within the ""normal"" population may face pressure from friends and family to start a family, celebrities often experience pressure on a global scale. Jennifer Aniston, in particular, has been subjected to intense public scrutiny regarding her decision to have children. 

The world's fascination with Aniston becoming a mother is evident. Numerous reports of her alleged pregnancies have circulated since as early as 1999 when she first rose to fame on the television show Friends and began a relationship with Brad Pitt. Over the years, more than 55 published articles mentioning her potential pregnancy have emerged globally. In fact, the online search interest for ""Jennifer Aniston Pregnant"" was even higher than the search interest for ""are we at war"" during a time when the possibility of a war loomed. 

The public's curiosity regarding Aniston's motherhood aspirations can be traced back to her early career and her portrayal of the character Rachel on Friends, who became a mother on the show. This, perhaps, fueled fans' interest in whether she would mirror her character's journey in real life. Furthermore, the roles Aniston took on in her professional endeavors often influenced the evolution of pregnancy rumors. 

Although the intensity of these rumors has varied over time, common triggers remain constant. Speculations arise whenever she wears loose clothing or appears bloated, during new relationships, and following the end of those relationships. Additionally, the progression of these rumors is closely linked to Aniston's age. 

In summary, Jennifer Aniston has been subjected to relentless speculation and pressure regarding her potential motherhood over the course of nearly two decades. This pervasive obsession with her personal life serves as a reminder that individuals, regardless of their celebrity status, deserve the right to make their own choices regarding starting a family.",rewrite_generation

However, notable figures in the entertainment industry took to Twitter to express their strong reactions towards the speech. A wide range of emotions ranging from anger to ridicule, skepticism, and sarcasm pervaded the responses of most celebrities. For instance, Josh Gad sarcastically likened the live broadcast of the State of the Union to an audacious, extended screening of the 'Purge' movie franchise on network television. 

Late-night comedians, such as Jimmy Kimmel, used the occasion to incorporate humor into their responses. Kimmel had Stormy Daniels, the adult film star who reportedly received payment to maintain silence about her alleged affair with Trump, as a guest on his show 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' Stephen Colbert, another late-night host, also employed his Twitter feed during the speech to comment cynically. He predicted that Trump would likely assert that his State of the Union address had a more significant turnout than Obama's.

Nevertheless, some celebrities voiced praise for Trump's speech. Conservative commentator Ann Coulter commended Trump's delivery, describing it as 'beautiful'. Chuck Woolery expressed appreciation for the speech's message of renewed optimism and prosperity for all Americans, emphasizing its inclusivity regardless of factors such as race, creed, or religion.

On the contrary, certain celebrities, like Elizabeth Banks, admitted they did not manage to endure the entirety of the speech due to perceived misinformation and unanswered questions. Banks chose to switch to listening to Tom Petty instead. Similarly, Questlove Gomez expressed uncertainty about whether the address had concluded.

A few celebrities decided not to watch at all. Chance the Rapper urged his followers to retweet his message if they were not tuning into the State of the Union. 

The reactions on Twitter were varied, with several notable figures sharing their opinions. Social activist and actress Ashley Judd used the platform to outline her vision for America, emphasizing the value of inclusivity regardless of religious beliefs, race, or country of origin. Jeffrey Wright expressed his deep aversion to Trump and his supporters, referring to them as a ""bizarre cult of self-interested sycophants."" Mark Ruffalo called for a focus on job creation and the needs of working people, rather than the interests of Wall Street.

These responses exemplify the diverse range of opinions and emotions elicited by President Trump's State of the Union address, showcasing the intense and polarizing nature of contemporary political discourse.",rewrite_generation

gossipcop-5077951266,"The royal wedding is a multi-million dollar affair. Chris Jackson / Getty  The average cost of a wedding for couples in the US and the UK is around $34,000 (£23,700).  Five figures is a huge expense for a one-day affair. That is, unless you're ultra-rich — and especially if you're royalty rich.  Next month, the world will bear witness to the most anticipated royal wedding in years. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to be married on May 19 at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor, and will begin a carriage procession immediately after the ceremony. Their reception will take place later on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding, an expense traditionally taken on by the bride's family.  The case was the same for Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 royal wedding— the only item Middleton paid for was her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress. Their total wedding celebration cost $34 million (£23.7 million).  Markle and Prince Harry's wedding will reportedly cost in excess of $45.8 million (£32 million), according to Bride Book's estimation. That's over 1,000 more than the average wedding.  The venue is the biggest part of a typical wedding budget for couples in the US and the UK, taking up nearly half of the entire wedding cost. Access to St. George's Chapel — and St. George's Great Hall, where the wedding reception will take place — is free of charge for Markle and Prince Harry. Transportation is also free, thanks to the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys.  The greatest cost for the royal couple? Security. Protecting Markle and Prince Harry, plus thousands of guests and onlookers, will run Kensington Palace a whopping $43 million (£30 million), estimates Bride Book. That includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones. The bulk of Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding budget similarly went to security costs.  Otherwise, Markle and Prince Harry's total wedding spend, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to about $2.8 million.

While the average cost of a wedding for couples in the US and UK is around $34,000, this royal affair is expected to surpass that figure significantly. Kensington Palace will cover the expenses, a departure from the traditional practice of the bride's family bearing the cost.

The venue itself holds no charge for Markle and Prince Harry, as they have access to St. George's Chapel and St. George's Great Hall for their reception. Transportation is also taken care of, courtesy of the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys. However, the largest part of the budget will be allocated towards security, estimated to be an impressive $43 million. This significant expenditure includes the implementation of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones to ensure the safety of Markle, Prince Harry, their guests, and the thousands of onlookers.

Compared to the average wedding, Markle and Prince Harry's total spending on other aspects, such as food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to approximately $2.8 million. It should be noted that the most expensive item for the bride is her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress.

This highly-anticipated event is expected to cost over $45.8 million, according to Bride Book's estimation, which is more than 1,000 times the average wedding cost. Similar to Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding in 2011, Kensington Palace will bear the majority of the expenses, highlighting the distinction and privilege of royal weddings.

Just eerie stuff.”  PHOTOS: Nicole Kidman & Keith Urban Hit The Beach Amid Rumored Marriage Trouble  The hair-raising account follows reports that country crooner Keith, 50, is considering shelling out $39 million for the Upper East Side townhouse that the King of Pop once called home.  The couple — parents of daughters Sunday Rose, 9, and Faith Margaret, 6 — already own homes in Beverly Hills, Australia and Nashville.  Sources said Keith wanted to gift Nicole, also 50, with a lavish Big Apple base while she broadens her already glittering career.  “Nicole is keen to do Broadway shows and get into making more TV programs, and New York is a better place for them to be than Nashville,” said a source.

While some suggest that the King of Pop may still linger within the walls, it is important to approach such claims with an open mind.
 
Witnesses have described the occurrences as subtle and hard-to-detect, as is often the case with paranormal phenomena. Mysterious sounds, flickering lights, unusual shadows, and sudden changes in temperature have been reported by visitors to the six-story, 16-room townhouse. Some have even experienced what can only be described as localized ""cold spots"" that momentarily bring a chill to the air.

Given Michael Jackson's complex life and the challenges he faced, it is perhaps not uncommon for remnants of his energy to remain in the places he once occupied. Despite these reports, it is important to note that there is no evidence of any overt supernatural activity, such as hearing the famous artist singing or witnessing him perform his iconic moonwalk.

Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban, renowned figures in the entertainment industry and parents to two beautiful daughters, have expressed a desire to establish a home in the vibrant city of New York. This move aligns with Nicole's aspirations to expand her already illustrious career by pursuing opportunities in Broadway shows and television productions. Furthermore, it provides a convenient base for the couple as they continue to maintain residences in other prominent locations such as Beverly Hills, Australia, and Nashville.

As with any haunted tales, skepticism is natural. However, the claims about Michael Jackson's lingering presence in this historic mansion add a layer of intrigue to Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban's acquisition. Whether there is any truth to these accounts or merely a reflection of the human tendency to seek connections with the past, the allure of this New York dream home remains resolute.",rewrite_generation

Despite Ellen publicly denying any marital issues, insiders claim that the couple has been spending nights apart and now appears to be living completely separate lives. Property records indicate that they maintained separate residences on their six-acre estate in Montecito, California, which recently sold for $11 million. Adding to the speculation about their troubled marriage, Ellen purchased her own property nine miles away in Carpinteria. This $18.6 million beachfront mansion, bought secretly in October 2017, has raised concerns about the couple's long-term compatibility. While Ellen is known for her investments in real estate, sources suggest that her recent acquisitions may be more about having separate living spaces as she and Portia move closer to a formal separation. Insiders reveal that the couple spends increasingly less time together and hardly communicate throughout the day. Portia reportedly feels neglected and mistreated, claiming that she supports Ellen in everything while receiving little support in return. Experts predict that if their divorce proceedings move forward, it could become one of the most expensive in Hollywood history, given their combined fortune, future earnings, and properties valued at $400 million. The lack of intimacy between Ellen and Portia has not gone unnoticed, despite attempts to project a happy image in public.

She has undergone a knee surgery before which she was a college football player for the Graceland Yellowjackets. More Bio…","Caitlyn Jenner, the renowned TV personality and former Olympic gold medal-winning decathlon champion, has recently found a unique way of embracing her womanhood. In an article titled ""Cellulite Makes Cait Feel So Womanly!"", trending in the National Enquirer/RadarOnline, Jenner expresses her joy in the presence of cellulite on her thighs, hips, and tummy and eagerly anticipates the opportunity to show it off.

While this may seem unconventional to many, especially considering that most individuals try to conceal their cellulite, Jenner's perspective offers a fresh take on body acceptance. Rather than disdaining her body for its lumpy flesh, Jenner is choosing to honor and respect her physical form. By embracing her cellulite, she exemplifies the idea that self-respect is essential; if we do not respect our own bodies, we cannot expect respect from others.

Moreover, Jenner's decision to proudly display her dimpled flesh in a bikini this summer has garnered significant attention from the media. Given that cellulite is a common occurrence, even among ordinary individuals, such an open and positive attitude toward it is both refreshing and unusual, particularly from a well-known TV personality.

Interestingly, the article also notes that Jenner considers her cellulite as a rite of passage into true womanhood, emphasizing her belief that this physical attribute enhances her femininity. Additionally, it is reported that Jenner would not mind if she were to develop even more cellulite in the future. This stands in stark contrast to her past experiences as a decathlete, during which she endured rigorous dieting and fitness regimens.

Perhaps this shift in mindset can be attributed in part to Jenner's desire to support her daughter, Kim, who has also faced public scrutiny regarding her own cellulite. Alternatively, it may simply reflect Jenner's personal journey of self-acceptance and self-expression.

While various rumors and speculations have surrounded Caitlyn Jenner in the past, it is important to rely on accurate information when discussing her. Coming out as transgender in April 2015, Jenner has since undergone gender reassignment surgery and has been open about her disinterest in men. However, it is important not to confuse rumors with facts, as they may contain elements of truth alongside misinformation.

In summary, Caitlyn Jenner, formerly known as Bruce Jenner, is not just a decathlete and television personality but also a figure who challenges societal norms and expectations. By proudly embracing her cellulite, she exemplifies the importance of self-respect and body acceptance. As rumors continue to circulate, it is essential to rely on accurate information when discussing Jenner's life and experiences.",rewrite_generation

While this news may come as a relief to his fans, it is worth noting that Pitt has shown remarkable dedication to raising awareness and funds for those afflicted with rare diseases.

One such condition is Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB), a rare skin disorder. Pitt is an honorary member of the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation (EBMRF), an organization committed to supporting individuals with this debilitating disorder. Earlier this year, Pitt made an appearance at the Rock4EB charity event, where he introduced singer Chris Cornell, in aid of the EBMRF.

Additionally, Pitt has openly discussed his own self-diagnosis with another rare condition known as prosopagnosia, also referred to as face blindness. In a 2013 interview with Esquire Magazine, he shared his struggles in recognizing familiar faces and how he often forgets people he has met before. It is important to acknowledge that self-diagnosis differs from a formal diagnosis, and certain nuances may be overlooked.

Prosopagnosia is a condition characterized by the inability to recognize familiar faces or stimuli, such as objects or animals. Those affected by this condition often rely on other cues, such as voice, walking style, and hairstyle, to identify individuals. The genetic cause of developmental prosopagnosia is not yet fully understood, but familial evidence suggests a possible autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.

In contrast, Epidermolysis Bullosa is a group of severe genetic skin disorders that primarily impact children. It results in painful skin blistering and erosion throughout the body. The most severe form, known as recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, involves chronic blistering, painful wounds, joint stiffness, and other complications. This condition arises due to a deficiency in type VII collagen (C7), caused by mutations in the COL7A1 gene.

Individuals with Epidermolysis Bullosa endure a lifetime of excruciating pain, with limited treatment options available to alleviate their symptoms. Medical researchers and organizations like the EBMRF strive to find effective solutions for those affected by this devastating disease.

Brad Pitt's involvement in raising awareness for these rare diseases highlights the importance of supporting individuals battling such conditions. His dedication to these causes serves as an inspiration to others, encouraging them to join the fight against these debilitating disorders and bring hope to those in need.",rewrite_generation

USA TODAY President Trump in Trump Tower. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) Corrections & Clarifications: A previous version of the story included a tweet from a parody account claiming to Jill Biden. NEW YORK CITY – President Trump's argument Tuesday that left wing groups were just as violent as the white supremacists who staged a demonstration in Charlottesville set off a firestorm of criticism from members of his own party – and raised questions about his personal views of racial tensions in the country. Just one day after Trump sought to tamp down on controversy by condemning white supremacists for their role in racially motivated clashes in the Virginia city, the president appeared to return to his highly criticized initial response that many sides were to blame for the weekend violence. ""What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, alt-right?"" Trump told reporters in a chaotic impromptu press conference at Trump Tower. ""Do they have any semblance of guilt? What about the fact they came charging with clubs in their hands?"" Trump said he couldn't make a condemnation of hate groups earlier because he didn't ""know all the facts"" about an alleged white nationalist who crashed a car into a crowd of protesters, killing one person and wounded 19 others. CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump told reporters that both sides were to blame for the violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY ""I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct,"" Trump said from Trump Tower in New York, after an event that was intended to be devoted to a new infrastructure executive order. Trump has been especially quick to denounce previous terrorist attacks, including those taking place overseas. Yet he was notably reticent to pinpoint the blame for one on Saturday that involved white supremacists – a point his critics on both sides of the aisle continued to hammer. ""We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. added: ""There is only one side to be on when a white supremacist mob brutalizes and murders in America.” Several lawmakers were dismayed the president appeared to equate white supremacists with their opponents. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., tweeted: ""Blaming 'both sides' for #Charlottesville?! No. Back to relativism when dealing with KKK, Nazi sympathizers, white supremacists? Just no."" Another Republican, Rep. Charlie Dent from Pennsylvania, said Trump ""must stop the moral equivalency! AGAIN."" Over the weekend, Trump faced heavy criticism from both Republicans and Democrats for chiding ""many sides"" for their role in the violence in Charlottesville on Saturday, a statement many regarded as tepid toward racists. A full two days later, on Monday, Trump at the White House directly condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and announced the Justice Department would open up a civil rights investigation into the driver of the car that killed Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer. Yet on Tuesday, amid questions about whether Trump meant the words behind his most recent scripted statement, the president called his initial response ""fine"" and blamed the press for being dishonest in its coverage. ""There was no way of making a correct statement that early,"" he said at one point. ""I had to see the facts. Unlike a lot of reporters – I didn't know (prominent white supremacist) David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts."" For his part, former KKK leader Duke tweeted a thank you to the president after his statement Tuesday – for condemning ""the leftist terrorists"" in Black Lives Matter and Antifa.",1,en,"CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump told reporters that he believed both protesters and counter protesters were to blame for the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.

NEW YORK CITY – President Trump's argument Tuesday that left wing groups were just as violent as the white supremacists who staged a demonstration in Charlottesville set off a firestorm of criticism from members of his own party – and raised questions about his personal views of racial tensions in the country. Just one day after Trump sought to tamp down on controversy by condemning white supremacists for their role in racially motivated clashes in the Virginia city, the president appeared to return to his highly criticized initial response that many sides were to blame for the weekend violence. ""What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, alt-right?"" Trump told reporters in a chaotic impromptu press conference at Trump Tower. ""Do they have any semblance of guilt? What about the fact they came charging with clubs in their hands?"" Trump said he couldn't make a condemnation of hate groups earlier because he didn't ""know all the facts"" about an alleged white nationalist who crashed a car into a crowd of protesters, killing one person and wounded 19 others. CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump told reporters that both sides were to blame for the violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY ""I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct,"" Trump said from Trump Tower in New York, after an event that was intended to be devoted to a new infrastructure executive order. Trump has been especially quick to denounce previous terrorist attacks, including those taking place overseas. Yet he was notably reticent to pinpoint the blame for one on Saturday that involved white supremacists – a point his critics on both sides of the aisle continued to hammer. ""We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. added: ""There is only one side to be on when a white supremacist mob brutalizes and murders in America.” Several lawmakers were dismayed the president appeared to equate white supremacists with their opponents. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., tweeted: ""Blaming 'both sides' for #Charlottesville?! No. Back to relativism when dealing with KKK, Nazi sympathizers, white supremacists? Just no."" Another Republican, Rep. Charlie Dent from Pennsylvania, said Trump ""must stop the moral equivalency! AGAIN."" Over the weekend, Trump faced heavy criticism from both Republicans and Democrats for chiding ""many sides"" for their role in the violence in Charlottesville on Saturday, a statement many regarded as tepid toward racists. A full two days later, on Monday, Trump at the White House directly condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and announced the Justice Department would open up a civil rights investigation into the driver of the car that killed Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer. Yet on Tuesday, amid questions about whether Trump meant the words behind his most recent scripted statement, the president called his initial response ""fine"" and blamed the press for being dishonest in its coverage. ""There was no way of making a correct statement that early,"" he said at one point. ""I had to see the facts. Unlike a lot of reporters – I didn't know (prominent white supremacist) David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts."" For his part, former KKK leader Duke tweeted a thank you to the president after his statement Tuesday – for condemning ""the leftist terrorists"" in Black Lives Matter and Antifa. CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump defends his decision to delay responding to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY Trump also said ""not all of those people"" who attended the demonstration were not racist or neo-Nazi, but only wanted to protest the city's plans to remove the Robert E. Lee statue. That statement also drew catcalls from Republicans. ""If you're showing up to a Klan rally, you're probably a racist or a bigot,"" said Rep. Will Hurd, R-Tex., said on CNN. And Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., tweeted that ""the organizers of events"" that led to the Charlottesville terror attack ""are 100% to blame."" The white supremacists, Rubio tweeted, are ""adherents of an evil ideology which argues certain people are inferior because of race, ethnicity or nation of origin.... When (there's an) entire movement built on anger and hatred towards people different than you, it justifies and ultimately leads to violence against them."" Rubio offered a direct message to Trump: ""Mr. President, you can't allow #WhiteSupremacists to share only part of blame... (they) will see being assigned only 50% of blame as a win. We can not allow this old evil to be resurrected."" More: Trump distances himself from strategist Steve Bannon in wake of Charlottesville violence The president was slated to only discuss infrastructure during his appearances, but took questions from reporters for more than 15 minutes, most of them about Charlottesville. Some aides looked dismayed as he answered more questions. During a rollicking, impromptu news conference in which Trump and reporters frequently argued and interrupted each other, the president also: Questioned moves by local government to remove Confederate statues and monuments from public places Trump openly wondered whether tributes to George Washington and Thomas Jefferson are at risk because they were slave owners. ""You really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?"" Trump said. On the other hand, Trump said local governments are free to make their own decisions on these issues. CLOSE At Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump explains to the media that he thinks removing statues like the one","President Trump addressed the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia from Trump Tower in New York City, expressing his belief that both protesters and counter protesters shared responsibility. His comments caused widespread criticism from members of his party and raised concerns about his stance on racial tensions in the country. Despite condemning white supremacists the day before, Trump seemed to backtrack and claim that multiple sides were to blame for the violence. He questioned whether the ""alt-left"" should also be held accountable for their violent actions. Trump explained that he couldn't immediately condemn hate groups because he did not have all the facts regarding the car incident that resulted in one death and multiple injuries. Trump emphasized that unlike most politicians, he wanted to ensure his statements were accurate. However, his delayed and ambiguous response drew heavy criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, who denounced white supremacy and urged for a clear condemnation of the violence. Lawmakers expressed dismay at Trump's suggestion of equivalence between white supremacists and their opponents. In response to the backlash, Trump defended his decision to delay his initial response, blaming the press for being dishonest and stating that he needed to gather all the facts. Former KKK leader David Duke thanked the president for condemning what he referred to as ""leftist terrorists"" in groups like Black Lives Matter and Antifa. Trump faced further criticism when he claimed that not all attendees of the demonstration were racist or neo-Nazis, arguing that some were simply protesting the removal of the Robert E. Lee statue. Republicans rejected this notion, asserting that those who attended a Klan rally were likely racist or bigoted. Senator Marco Rubio highlighted the danger of an ideology that promotes hatred and justifies violence against people based on race or ethnicity. Rubio urged Trump not to assign only 50% of the blame to white supremacists, as it would give them a sense of victory. The president's impromptu press conference, originally intended to focus on infrastructure, revolved mainly around Charlottesville. Trump expressed skepticism towards the removal of Confederate statues and monuments by local governments, questioning whether tributes to George Washington and Thomas Jefferson would also be at risk due to their slave ownership. Despite these comments, Trump acknowledged that local authorities had the freedom to make decisions on these matters.",rewrite_generation

After deciding that she just can’t let go of this hunk, Mariah reportedly decided to make it happen – an engagement, that is! “Word is Mariah took matters into her own hands,” a source tells OK! magazine, “It was an unusual proposal but it did the trick. She wrote a song about how she wanted Bryan to be her husband and she performed it for him while wearing a sexy, glitzy gown. Then she explained that she’s ready for them to make their relationship official.”  Bryan gave a “hearty yes,” as the insider says, “He couldn’t believe his luck!” It appears Bryan also thinks he and Mariah belong together, and he always wants to be her baby. These two aren’t waiting around for one sweet day to tie the knot. While love takes time, Mariah and Bryan are already busy making wedding plans. “Mariah would love to get married in May at the Grand Wailea Resort in Maui,” the insider told OK!, “where she and Bryan first went public with their romance.” Mariah and Bryan struck up a relationship in late 2016, with Mariah low-key confirming the romance in February 2017 by calling Bryan her “boyfriend.”  Mariah’s “also toying with the idea of a winter wonderland wedding,” the source says. “After all, she is the queen of Christmas!” Could Mariah have the fantasy holiday wedding she’s always wanted, saying “Thank God I found you” to her honey, her all? Whenever Mariah decides to get married, don’t forget about us when it comes to the wedding invitations!  This alleged engagement would be the third time Mariah walked down the aisle, as she was previously married to Tommy Mottola, 68, and Nick Cannon, 37.

Nick and Mariah’s twins – son Morocco and daughter Monroe, 6 – will be featured in his wedding, and sources say Mariah’s thinking of asking Nick to walk her down the aisle. “[He] will always be a big part of her life,” the source added.

According to sources, Mariah, aged 47, expressed her love for Bryan, 34, through an unconventional proposal. The singer composed a song dedicated to her desire of marrying Bryan, which she performed while adorned in an elegant gown. This heartfelt gesture was followed by Mariah expressing her readiness to formalize their relationship. Bryan, overwhelmed by this extraordinary moment, responded with an enthusiastic ""yes"" to Mariah's proposal.

Evidently, Bryan shares Mariah's sentiment and envisions a future together. The couple wasted no time in starting their wedding preparations, disregarding the notion of waiting for the perfect moment. Mariah has expressed a preference for holding the ceremony at the Grand Wailea Resort in Maui, a place of sentimental significance as it marks the start of their publicized romance. Additionally, the idea of a winter-themed wedding, considering Mariah's association with Christmas, has piqued her interest.

Taking into account Mariah's previous marital experiences with Tommy Mottola and Nick Cannon, both ending in heartbreak, Mariah is being prudent in safeguarding her substantial fortune. To ensure a secure future, she is reportedly in the process of creating a prenuptial agreement, leaving nothing to chance.

Interestingly, Nick Cannon, Mariah's ex-husband and father to their twins, Morocco and Monroe, is expected to play an important role in the upcoming wedding. Mariah may even request that Nick accompany her down the aisle. This proposition is not surprising, especially given their recent joint appearance at the 2018 Kids' Choice Awards, highlighting the enduring bond between Mariah, Nick, and their children.

As Mariah Carey contemplates her pursuit of marital bliss once again, it is evident that her love life continues to captivate the public's interest. The possibility of an imminent wedding leaves us eagerly awaiting further developments and an invitation to witness the culmination of Mariah's heartfelt journey.",rewrite_generation

Lohan's determination to earn an audition for the role has prompted her to reach out to Ben Affleck, renowned for his portrayal of Batman in the DC Extended Universe, for assistance in securing the part of Batgirl, a role known for its captivating portrayal of a courageous redhead.

A reliable source has revealed to Australia's NW Magazine that Lohan has persistently attempted to communicate with Affleck, as she admires his resilience in the face of adversity. Affleck, having overcome personal challenges, notably sharing his experiences with alcoholism while visiting Lohan during her time in rehab in 2013, inspired her to embark on her own journey towards sobriety. This encounter marked the beginning of a friendship between the two actors.

However, Lohan faces formidable competition for the role of Batgirl, with Emma Stone currently considered a frontrunner for the Warner Bros. Pictures and DC Films project. Nonetheless, director Joss Whedon, 53, has expressed his desire to cast an unknown actress, emphasizing the importance of finding the perfect fit for the iconic role. In his own words, ""I doubt it will be a name. This is somewhere where you go and find Batgirl and then you cast her. I'm not against movie stars, they're great, but you need somebody who's going to be just right.""

Lohan, who divides her time between America and Dubai, has found solace in the United Arab Emirates, allowing her to embrace a more private life. Reflecting on her experiences, the accomplished star of ""Mean Girls"" admits that she struggled to navigate fame at a young age. She relishes the serenity offered by Dubai, where she can have fun in a different, more fulfilling manner.

In conclusion, Lindsay Lohan's unwavering determination to portray Batgirl, combined with her friendship with Ben Affleck, has placed her in contention for the highly coveted role. However, she must surpass stiff competition, including Emma Stone, as director Joss Whedon seeks an exceptional yet unfamiliar talent to encapsulate the essence of Batgirl. Lohan, having cultivated a more private and fulfilling life in Dubai, is eagerly awaiting the outcome of this exciting casting process.",rewrite_generation

Jackman even described the process that goes into the filming of shirtless scenes, which he said involves drinking ten liters of water a day in the months leading up to the scenes, which he said are accomplished through dehydration.  “It’s sort of unbelievable to me, what I did for seventeen years,” Jackman revealed. “The first one, I thought you could get into shape in three weeks. The director pushed all the ‘shirt off’ scenes to the very end.”  “You stop drinking water about 30 hours before you shoot,” Jackman said, explaining the process. “You lose ten pounds of water weight.”  But now that that’s over, Jackman is already enjoying himself.  “Now I’m eating and loving it,” Jackman told Colbert. “Sometimes waking up at two in the morning just to have breakfast cereal, and then go back to bed.”  “With it still in my lap,” he added.

(Last Updated )","Hugh Jackman appeared as a guest on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert this evening, where an important question was posed to the Logan actor. With his tenure as Wolverine behind him, would we finally glimpse the persona of ""fat Jackman""? For the past seventeen years, Jackman had to maintain peak physical condition to execute shirtless scenes for the movies. He unveiled the rigorous process that accompanied filming such scenes, involving the consumption of ten liters of water daily in the months leading up to filming, which in turn caused dehydration. Expressing his astonishment, Jackman disclosed, ""I find it quite astonishing what I did for seventeen years. Initially, I thought I could achieve the desired body shape in just three weeks. However, the director saved all the 'shirt off' scenes for the end."" Jackman further elaborated on the preparation required, sharing, ""Approximately 30 hours prior to shooting, one must refrain from drinking water. This leads to a ten-pound reduction in water weight."" Now liberated from those demands, Jackman is relishing in the pleasures of indulgence. He informed Colbert, ""Currently, I am enjoying my meals immensely. On occasion, I even wake up at two in the morning to enjoy a bowl of breakfast cereal, only to go back to bed - with the cereal still in my lap."" Together, let us welcome Jackman into our ranks!

Our exclusive investigation reveals that this incident never took place. 

Life & Style magazine claims that Maguire recently spotted Stone at the famed Hollywood hotel and engaged in observing her attentively, hoping for her acknowledgment. The publication's questionable source suggests that the actor eventually approached Stone and proceeded to shower her with insincere compliments, emphasizing the adoration she receives from the entire entertainment industry. 

Supposedly, Stone exhibited disinterest towards Maguire's advancements but eventually relented, providing him with her contact information and suggesting a coffee meeting, before swiftly departing. The alleged insider insinuates that Stone's actions made it apparent that she was dismissive of Maguire's attempts. 

However, Gossip Cop, in direct communication with a reliable source close to Maguire, found the entire narrative presented by the tabloid to be fabricated and baseless. Our source confirms that these events simply did not occur. Regrettably, it comes as no surprise that Life & Style would publish such a fictitious story.

Reflecting on Justin's past relationship with Angelina Jolie, Jen cannot help but question if history is repeating itself.

gossipcop-3308884181,"Beyoncé Rumored To Be Asking For Silent Delivery  As the countdown to Blueprint 1 and Blueprint 2’s arrival continues, the stories about Bey’s birth plans abound. First, we heard she planned to give birth at home, then they said her security has been running weekly drills to practice their approach to Cedars-Sinai and now there’s a report that Bey wants silence in the delivery room.  According to Naughty Gossip reports:  “Beyoncé likes peace and calm around her. She has zero time for drama and gossip. She likes her inner circle to be soft spoken if they have to talk at all. And you can expect the same will be true when she gives birth to the twins,” sources tell Straight Shuter. “You can only get into her private life if you are invited. She is very guarded and protects her privacy at all cost. She likes to be surrounded with peaceful colors and soft sounds. This will be of utmost importance for her when giving birth.”  This story is almost like opening up a fortune cookie or visiting your average storefront psychic. EVERYBODY knows Beyoncé is private. THAT doesn’t take an exclusive source to figure out.  Silent birth is a real thing though – something that Scientologists practice and Katie Holmes even did when she gave birth to Suri, but as much as Bey loves music we don’t really see her doing a silent birth.  Speaking of Bey’s love of music… Hit the flip for some recently posted pics of her from a Michael Jackson/Prince party.

GettyImages/Instagram","Rumors Circulate that Beyoncé Plans for a Silent Delivery

With the imminent arrival of Blueprint 1 and Blueprint 2, speculations surrounding Beyoncé's birth plans have been increasing. Initially, there were reports of her intention to give birth at home, followed by claims that her security team has been meticulously preparing for their approach to Cedars-Sinai. Recently, a new report has emerged, stating that Beyoncé wishes for silence in the delivery room.

According to reliable sources from Naughty Gossip, ""Beyoncé values peace and tranquility in her surroundings. She actively avoids unnecessary drama and gossip. When it comes to communication within her inner circle, she prefers soft-spoken individuals or no talking at all. It is only through invitation that others may enter her private life. She is extremely protective of her privacy and prioritizes a serene environment, characterized by peaceful colors and gentle sounds, even during childbirth.""

While it is commonly known that Beyoncé is a private individual, these revelations regarding her birthing preferences are reminiscent of opening up a fortune cookie or visiting an average storefront psychic. Furthermore, the concept of silent birth, although practiced by some Scientologists and even by Katie Holmes during her delivery of Suri, does not seem to align with Beyoncé's deep affinity for music.

Speaking of her love for music, we invite you to view some recently posted images of Beyoncé, captured during a Michael Jackson/Prince themed party, by flipping through the slideshow provided by GettyImages/Instagram.",rewrite_generation

The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.

Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner’s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  ‘She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,’ said the source. ‘But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making ‘I am Cait’ shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner’s ‘unpredictable’ behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: ‘[The book] is definitely something that she’s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  ‘But the family were like, it’s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  ‘They were worried because she’s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.’  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J.

In an effort to highlight her journey, Jenner has planned a nude photo shoot, which is anticipated to be a defining moment since her transition was publicly announced in an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer in April 2015, followed by a stunning appearance in Vanity Fair. Although the Kardashian-Jenner family is said to be fully supportive of Jenner's transition, sources close to the family reveal that a nude shoot represents their worst nightmare. A reliable insider has disclosed that the Kardashian-Jenner clan became aware of this plan through Jenner's son, Brody. The family views this as an excessive and unnecessary step. Kris Jenner, who reportedly had prior knowledge of Jenner's surgery, has pledged to prevent the photo shoot from taking place. Communications have been initiated with both Jenner's and the Kardashian family's representatives for further comments on the matter. It's worth noting that Jenner's previous appearance in Vanity Fair, known as the 'I am Cait' shoot, caused tension within the family at the time, particularly between Jenner and Kim Kardashian. However, despite internal conflicts, the family has publicly voiced their support for Jenner's decision to transition, which was ultimately completed in January. Jenner herself expressed her satisfaction with the surgery, stating, 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated. I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.' Unfortunately, these recent developments have strained Jenner's relationship with her former spouse and step-children. The memoir, composed with the assistance of journalist Buzz Bissinger, has intensified the discord and magnified Jenner's unpredictable behavior, causing further estrangement with her family. It is clear that the memoir was a long-desired project for Jenner, and the family was apprehensive about the potential reopening of past conflicts. Given Jenner's recent unpredictable behavior and her desire for attention, the family has been wary throughout this process. Additionally, an embarrassing revelation emerged from another leaked extract of the memoir, wherein Jenner claimed that the late Robert Kardashian knew of O.J. Simpson's guilt in the murder of Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman. Kardashian, who was the father of Kourtney, Khloe, Kim, and Rob Kardashian, was a member of Simpson's defense team during his highly publicized trial.",rewrite_generation

The former Real Housewife of New York, ran around the grounds in an A-line Carolina Herrera dress, posing on the step-and-repeat, taking photos with fans, and catching up with old friends. Trying to track her down for an interview turned into a scavenger hunt.  Scattered around the lawn were tables for vendors selling everything from wine to sex toys. There was a station for guests to get a vitamin infusion, with seats in the direct line of the sun transforming the spot into an inescapable sauna-I.V. drip hybrid. Housewives from across the country flew into town for the occasion (Vicki Gunvalson of Orange County and LeeAnne Locken of Dallas), which also served as a benefit for Thyroid Cancer Research in honor of Zarin’s late husband, Bobby, who died of the disease in January.  Upon first try to flag Zarin down for a couple of questions, she sent over her daughter, Ally Shapiro, in her stead. Shapiro reflected on last year’s luncheon, when her stepfather was still struggling with cancer, but encouraged her and her mother to party on.  “He loved drinking and partying. This was the highlight of his year,” she said. “It was this time last year that we were told he wasn’t gonna make it another week, and he pushed us and he said, ‘Go to the party. Maybe I won’t be here when you come back, but go.’”  Shapiro, who now lives in London while she works on her master’s degree, admits that she can’t watch old episodes of Real Housewives, which showed her as 14-year-old struggling to get close to her stepfather. “You want to think that it’s like a home movie, but it’s not. That’s not what our relationship was like,” she said, adding that the reruns play constantly in the U.K. “I’m walking down the street and someone’s like, ‘Oh my God, I just saw you trying on a prom dress!’”  She also said that her mother is dabbling with dating, specifically with a man she plays tennis with. “It’s fun, and I live in London so it’s good for her to have a distraction.”  Dina Lohan, dressed in a metallic green blazer and shorts set and a pair of oversized aviators, arrived fashionably late to the affair, but was immediately greeted by hoards of people trying to chat her up or get a photo. Eventually secured in the same spot for more than a few seconds, she was willing to talk about her daughter Lindsay’s upcoming project for MTV, a Vanderpump Rules–inspired reality show that follows Lindsay and the employees of her new Lohan Beach Club. Bunim/Murray Productions is producing the series, the same company that produced Lohan’s E! reality show Living Lohan a decade ago.  “These kids were like, babies, and now they’re running the show,” she said of the crew. “They lived in my house! And now they’re all corporate. . . . We’re home. It’s cyclical, you know.”  Lohan also revealed that the upcoming series is a bit of a family affair with Lindsay’s younger sister, 24-year-old Ali, providing the theme song.  A friend of Lohan’s interjected, asking if Ali, like her older sister over a decade ago, had moved out to L.A. for work.  “She’s in New York with me,” the matriarch answered. “I keep them close! I’m not going to lose someone to L.A., no. Not again!”  Finally, the woman of the hour managed to stop and take a breath.

The former Real Housewife of New York, elegantly attired in a Carolina Herrera dress, graciously interacted with attendees. The pursuit of an interview with Zarin turned into quite the scavenger hunt. The event featured an array of vendors selling diverse items, ranging from wine to sex toys. Notably, a station provided guests with vitamin infusions, albeit under the direct exposure of the sun, turning the area into an unavoidable hybrid of a sauna and I.V. drip. Housewives from different parts of the country, including Vicki Gunvalson from Orange County and LeeAnne Locken from Dallas, flew in to attend the luncheon. The gathering also served as a benefit for Thyroid Cancer Research, paying tribute to Zarin's late husband, Bobby, who tragically succumbed to the illness in January.

Upon initial attempts to approach Zarin for an interview, she delegated her daughter, Ally Shapiro, to represent her. Shapiro shared her reflections on last year's luncheon, during which her stepfather battled cancer. Despite the circumstances, he encouraged them to attend the celebration, as he himself had cherished the joyous occasion. Shapiro, currently residing in London to pursue her master's degree, admitted her difficulty watching past episodes of Real Housewives, as they portray her struggles at the age of 14 to forge a connection with her stepfather. The reruns of the show are incessantly broadcasted in the U.K., leading to unexpected encounters with recognition from strangers. Shapiro also disclosed that her mother is venturing into the dating scene, specifically with a man she plays tennis with, providing a welcome distraction for her in London.

Dina Lohan, donned in a stylish metallic green blazer and shorts ensemble, arrived fashionably late to the luncheon, immediately attracting a crowd of people eager to engage in conversation or take a photo with her. Eventually finding a moment of respite, she candidly discussed Lindsay's upcoming MTV project, a reality show inspired by Vanderpump Rules, which will follow Lindsay and the employees of her new establishment, Lohan Beach Club. Interestingly, Bunim/Murray Productions, the same company that produced Lindsay's reality show on E! a decade ago, is producing this new series. Reflecting on the past, Lohan remarked on how the crew had grown from young individuals living in her house to now occupying corporate positions. She also shared that Lindsay's younger sister, Ali, has contributed the theme song for the show. When asked if Ali had also relocated to Los Angeles for work, Dina reassured that both of her daughters are together in New York, emphasizing her desire to keep her family close after previous experiences of separation.

Finally, amidst the festivities, Jill Zarin paused to catch her breath. Though no longer a Bravo housewife, she has not lost her ability to engage and socialize with others. Zarin has kept up with the current season of the show, receiving a supportive message from Luann de Lesseps, who recently entered rehab, expressing her well wishes for the event. Concluding our conversation, Zarin promoted her new line of rugs named ""Jill Zarin Rugs,"" which are not only pleasing to the eye, but also resistant to pet-related mishaps.

But a source tells PEOPLE she was there celebrating away from the cameras.  “Kylie looked great but didn’t really draw any attention to her baby bump,” the source says. “She still acts like she wants to keep her pregnancy private.”  Meanwhile, her sister Khloé Kardashian, — who earlier this week confirmed that she and boyfriend Tristan Thompson are expecting their first child together — accentuated her own baby bump in a skin-tight, sparkly jumpsuit with a white fur coat.  “Khloé was beaming all night,” the insider says of the 33-year-old Revenge Body host. “She kept touching and showing off her cute baby belly.”  Khloé showed off her bump on Instagram as well.  “Merry Christmas!!

Khloé radiated happiness throughout the night, often touching and proudly displaying her cute baby bump. She also shared an Instagram post depicting her gently caressing her belly, extending warm Christmas wishes to her followers.

gossipcop-5865271192,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.

T","Regrettably, Katie Holmes finds herself at the center of swirling reports regarding her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise, and their daughter Suri. According to a recent article on RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the brink of embarking on a $300,000 wedding ceremony. It was believed that their union would solidify their relationship, which has remained mostly concealed for the past five years. However, the 39-year-old actress and devoted single mother perceived that her 50-year-old Oscar-winning partner was not prepared to relinquish his flirtatious habits as a bachelor, including his continued friendly connection with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother of his 8-year-old daughter. The report alleges that Foxx even brought Grannis, not Holmes, as his companion to Leonardo DiCaprio's birthday celebration in November.

Consequently, Holmes made the difficult decision to call off the wedding and privately communicated her decision to end the relationship with Foxx, her co-star in ""Django Unchained."" Sources shared with RadarOnline that Foxx hesitated to agree to a prenuptial agreement containing a clause preventing infidelity because he comprehended the potential consequences should he succumb to temptation. ""Katie noticed a complete lack of respect in Jamie's behavior,"" a source divulged to RadarOnline. ""She understood that it wasn't beneficial for her or Suri and felt compelled to safeguard both of them.""

In the midst of these personal challenges, Holmes has been contending with Cruise's resolute efforts to reestablish a connection with their daughter, Suri. As Hollywood Life reported, citing Star magazine, Cruise has been tormented by the fact that he has been an absent father for over five years due to alleged directives from his Church of Scientology superiors. Tom loyal to Scientology unquestioningly complied with their instructions, thereby sacrificing his relationship with Suri. However, it is now conveyed that he regrets having missed out on so much and yearns to be a part of her life once again.

Holmes, on her part, is torn between her reservations about reuniting with Cruise and her desire to prioritize Suri's well-being. The report from Star stated that Holmes entered an agreement, promising to remain silent about Cruise and Scientology as long as he stayed away from their daughter and refrained from attempting to indoctrinate her into the controversial religious organization. An insider disclosed, ""She's gradually entertaining the notion of a reunion since Suri must be desperately missing her dad. Ultimately, Katie wants what's best for her daughter. Tom has reassured her that his religion will not be a part of their relationship, and Katie is starting to believe him.""

Representatives for Holmes have firmly denied both the breakup rumors involving Foxx as well as the reports about a potential reunion between her and Cruise for Suri's sake. However, it is worth noting that the denial regarding the breakup report was issued by Holmes' publicist, Leslie Sloane, who openly attached her name to the statement. This announcement holds significance since it denotes the first official acknowledgment, on the record, from either Holmes or Foxx regarding the existence of their relationship. Since their alleged dating initiation in 2013, both parties have gone to great lengths to keep their romance concealed – at one point, even necessitating Holmes disguising herself to meet Foxx at a restaurant.

The preservation of secrecy was imperative for Holmes, as her divorce settlement from Cruise allegedly restricted her from publicly dating anyone for five years, as per reports from September 2017. These reports emerged after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo, hand-in-hand, strolling along a Malibu beach. At the time, speculation arose, suggesting that the couple willingly allowed themselves to be captured in this way as the five-year ban on public dating had ostensibly expi",rewrite_generation

It is based on the 2007 novel Thirteen Reasons Why, written by Jay Asher. The series revolves around the life of Clay Jensen, a seventeen-year-old high school student, and his deceased friend Hannah Baker. Hannah tragically took her own life as a result of struggling to cope with the culture, rumors, and lack of support she faced from her friends and school. Before her death, she recorded thirteen reasons on cassette tapes, explaining why she made the decision to end her life.

The television series is a result of the collaborative efforts of July Moon Productions, Kicked to the Curb Productions, Anonymous Content, and Paramount Television. Brian Yorkey and Diana Son are the showrunners. The main characters in the series include Dylan Minnette as Clay Jensen, Katherine Langford as Hannah Baker, Christian Navarro, Alisha Boe, Brandon Flynn, Justin Prentice, Miles Heizer, Ross Butler, Devin Druid, Amy Hargreaves, Derek Luke, Kate Walsh, and Brian d'Arcy James.

Originally, there were plans for a film adaptation of Thirteen Reasons Why by Universal Pictures, with Selena Gomez set to play Hannah. However, those plans were set aside in favor of a television series. Netflix ordered the show straight to series in October 2015, and Selena Gomez became an executive producer instead. The first season of the series premiered on Netflix on March 31, 2017. It received positive reviews from both critics and viewers due to its engaging subject matter and the exceptional performances of Minnette and Langford. Langford's portrayal of Hannah, in particular, earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Drama Series.

While the series was well-received, it also sparked concerns among mental health professionals because of its graphic depiction of sensitive topics such as suicide and rape. In response, Netflix added a warning card and later included a video at the beginning of each season, cautioning viewers about the themes explored in the show. Despite the mixed reactions, Netflix decided to renew Thirteen Reasons Why for a second season, which was released on May 18, 2018. This season received negative reviews from critics, but the audience's response was more varied.

Following the second season, a third season was ordered in June 2018 and is scheduled for release in 2019. The series has generated controversy among both audiences and industry reviewers, with differing opinions on its impact and portrayal of sensitive subjects. 

The premise of the series centers around Clay Jensen receiving a box of cassette tapes left by Hannah Baker, containing her audio diary in which she explains why she made the tragic decision to end her life. Each person who receives the tapes has some connection to Hannah's reasons for suicide. Clay is not the first recipient, and instructions are given regarding how he should pass on the tapes after listening to them. The tapes follow a specific order of distribution, and an overseer holds an additional copy in case the plan encounters any obstacles. Each recording on the tapes sheds light on a different individual from Hannah's life who contributed to her decision to take her own life. 

In the second season, set several months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and other people mentioned on the tapes, along with close friends and family members of Hannah, become involved in a legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Hannah's mother files a lawsuit against the school, alleging negligence. As the trial unfolds, narratives from several individuals present in court provide insights into Hannah's story. Clay, who believes he failed to protect Hannah, launches his own investigation to gather evidence that could impact the outcome of the case. He also aims to expose the toxic culture at the high school that privileges wealthy, athletic male students at the expense of the average student, especially young girls like Hannah.

Throughout the second season, Clay experiences what appears to be communication with Hannah's ghost, which serves as a plot device. The series features an ensemble cast with various recurring characters who play different roles in the storyline.

Thirteen Reasons Why has garnered both praise and criticism for its portrayal of sensitive topics and its impact on viewers. The series has sparked public debate and divided opinions within the industry and among its audience.",rewrite_generation

In an exclusive conversation with HollywoodLife.com, a close source reveals Selena's reaction to the situation. It seems that Selena would have preferred if Charlie had kept their history private, as she values her personal life and relationships being kept under wraps. Maintaining her privacy when it comes to her dating life is of utmost importance to Selena. Our source informs us that Selena will eventually have to address Charlie's revelation, but it is frustrating for her when people publicly discuss personal matters. Selena has learned from her past experiences with Justin Bieber and The Weeknd that a more discreet approach is more beneficial, which is why her current relationship with Justin is less publicized. Rumors of a split between Selena and Justin were put to rest when the two were recently seen together at one of Justin's hockey games, arriving separately but leaving together.

The lack of confirmation has only intensified the curiosity surrounding Kylie's rumored pregnancy. With reports suggesting that she is due in February and expecting a baby girl with rapper Travis Scott, fans eagerly await any clues or announcements from the young star. Even Kylie's absence from the family's traditional Christmas card caused a stir among her devoted followers.

Fans have resorted to searching for glimpses of the truth themselves, as TMZ released blurry footage of Kylie's recent public appearance, where she was dressed in loose clothing. Additionally, a magazine photoshoot featured Kylie holding a baby lamb in a way that strategically concealed her growing belly. Some speculate that the official announcement may coincide with an episode of ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians,"" as rumors circulated that the season finale would be titled ""We're Expecting!"" However, this information has since been removed from the Wikipedia page.

If Kylie does give birth this month, her child will join the Kardashian family's newest addition, Chicago West, born via surrogate to Kim and Kanye West in January. Khloe Kardashian is also expecting a baby with NBA player Tristan Thompson, due in March. While some believe that Kylie's baby may make a delayed entrance into the public eye, insiders claim that Kylie is savoring her time away from the spotlight and has no plans to sell any photos of her child.

As the Kardashian-Jenner empire continues to expand in 2018, fans eagerly await any developments in Kylie's pregnancy journey, as her decision to keep this major life event private contrasts with her family's usual transparency.",rewrite_generation

Magazine is reporting that the ""Wildest Dreams"" singer has been contacting her ex ever since he has been in New York City starring in the Broadway show called Sunday in the Park With George.  The tabloid is reporting that a source is saying that Taylor is the one reaching out to the actor since she feels she is now more mature than she was when they dated back in 2010.  The source said, “Taylor was so young when they dated, she wasn’t ready for a serious relationship, but now she’s showing Jake how much she’s matured. She’s excited to see where things go.”  In 2015, a rumor swirled around saying that the stars were in contact with each other, even though she was dating Calvin Harris at the time.  An unidentified source told Star magazine that, “He said he owed Taylor an apology for how things ended between them. In June, Jake ran into Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show and asked for Taylor’s new number. They’ve kept in touch, albeit secretly, ever since.""  This would all be so ironic since Taylor allegedly wrote the hit song ""We Are Never Getting Back Together"" from her Red album about the relationship after her ex's friend asked her if they were giving their relationship a second chance.  “This guy walks in who is a friend of my ex’s and starts talking about how he’s heard we’re going to get back together.

The lyrics in the track said: ""I'm really gonna miss you picking fights / And me falling for it screaming that I'm right / And you would hide away and find your peace of mind / With some indie record that's much cooler than mine.""  In the video for the song, the actor who plays the singer's love interest gives her a scarf which many thought to be a clue that revealed the song was about Jake since she had been photographed wearing one of his scarfs while they were dating.  Since Taylor is now single and so is Jake and they both happen to be living in the same city, we don't see how this could be a problem.

The lyrics in the track said: ""I'm really gonna miss you picking fights / And me falling for it screaming that I'm right / And you would hide away and find your peace of mind / With some indie record that's much cooler than mine.""  In the video for the song, the actor who plays the singer's love interest gives her a scarf which many thought to be a clue that revealed the song was about Jake since she had been photographed wearing one of his scarfs while they were dating.  Since Taylor is now single and so is Jake and they both happen to be living in the same city, we don't see how this could be a problem. There is no confirmation that this is actually happening though and a source close to them told Gossip Cop that there was ""no truth"" to the report.  Do you think Taylor should get back together with Jake? Tell us in the comments.","Reports have surfaced suggesting that Taylor Swift is making efforts to reignite her past romance with Jake Gyllenhaal. According to a publication from OK! Magazine, the renowned singer-songwriter has been reaching out to her ex-boyfriend whilst he has been residing in New York City for his role in the Broadway production, Sunday in the Park With George. Citing an anonymous source, the tabloid claims that Taylor believes she has evolved into a more mature individual since their relationship in 2010 and is using this opportunity to showcase her personal growth to Jake. The source asserts, ""Taylor was quite young during their prior involvement, and she wasn't prepared for a committed relationship at the time. However, she now wishes to demonstrate her newfound maturity to Jake. She is genuinely looking forward to seeing where their interaction may lead."" In 2015, unverified rumors emerged suggesting that Taylor and Jake were in contact, despite her being romantically involved with Calvin Harris at the time. Star magazine reported that an undisclosed source mentioned, ""Jake expressed a desire to apologize to Taylor regarding the way their relationship ended."" As a result, during a chance encounter with Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show in June, Jake supposedly requested Taylor's updated phone number. Since then, they have allegedly maintained secret communication. It would be immensely ironic if this speculation held any truth, as Taylor reportedly composed the popular song ""We Are Never Getting Back Together,"" featured on her Red album, as a direct response to their past romance. The singer revealed during an interview with ABC's Good Morning America, ""A friend of my ex walked into a room and started discussing rumors about us reconciling. This wasn't the case at all. Frustrated by the on-again, off-again nature of our relationship, I picked up the guitar, and my songwriting partner Max Martin stated, 'This is what we're composing.'"" Notably, the song's lyrics include the lines, ""I'm",rewrite_generation

She has allegedly been dating a mystery man for months now, and hasn’t told Brad a thing!  She’s still technically married to Brad Pitt, 52, but Angelina Jolie, 41, allegedly has her heart set on a new marriage. Barely a year after filing for divorce from her husband, Angelina is reportedly planning her fourth wedding to a wealthy, 40-something businessman and philanthropist, according to InTouch Weekly! Angelina and her handsome British guy reportedly started dating in early 2017, and has been keeping the whole relationship “very hush-hush.” That means that Brad has no idea she’s dating, let alone engaged or getting married. Uh oh!  “Angelina could tell Brad what’s going on but she’s choosing not to,” a source told InTouch. She reportedly hopes he “will be taken by complete surprise. If it makes Brad unhappy when he finds out, she’s fine with that.” She actually hasn’t even told her six kids about the alleged wedding for fear that they’ll spill the beans to their dad. Crafty!  As for the wedding itself, Angelina’s reportedly taking her closest friends and family to Cambodia, “her second home,” for a traditional Buddhist ceremony, according to the source. The wedding will allegedly take place on a wildlife reserve, wear traditional Cambodian clothing, and serve local delicacies at the reception. “Angie’s thinking of having Shiloh, Zahara, and Vivienne as bridesmaids and Maddox as the groom’s best man since Maddox sort of feels he’s the man of the family now,” the source said.

Although she is still technically married to Brad Pitt, it is said that Angelina has her sights set on a new union with a wealthy businessman and philanthropist in his forties. The couple, who reportedly began dating earlier this year, have been keeping their relationship under wraps. This means that Brad is completely unaware of Angelina's new romantic endeavor, let alone any plans for marriage. It appears that Angelina has deliberately chosen to keep him in the dark, with sources suggesting that she hopes he will be taken aback when he eventually discovers the truth. While this revelation may cause some unhappiness for Brad, Angelina seems unfazed by this prospect. In fact, she hasn't even informed their six children about the alleged wedding, fearing that they might inadvertently reveal the secret. This demonstrates her cunningness in managing the situation. As for the wedding itself, it is rumored that Angelina intends to hold a traditional Buddhist ceremony in Cambodia, which she considers her second home. The event will take place on a wildlife reserve and encompass traditional Cambodian attire and local cuisine at the reception. The source also revealed that Angelina plans to involve her children in various roles, such as bridesmaids and the best man. One of their children will even serve as the ring bearer, while another will handle DJ duties and bake the wedding cake. Despite these exciting details, one can only wonder what Brad's reaction will be once he learns of these developments.

Kim Kardashian, 37, is reportedly at her wits end when it comes to dealing with husband Kanye West, 40. She’s struggled since Kanye’s terrifying November 2016 breakdown, and she reportedly can’t see a light at the end of the tunnel, according to an insider who spoke to Star Magazine. “Between his raging ego and mood swings, Kanye has been a total train wreck,” the insider alleged to the Star. “Kim is stressed enough raising two kids and getting ready for the baby without Kanye dragging her down. She’s tried to hang in there, but she just can’t take it anymore.”  Poor Kim! We can’t imagine how hard it must be to have a family member — especially your husband — go through such a huge health scare. Of course she’s stressed! If they’re truly divorcing, things are about to get crazy. She allegedly doesn’t want to make any moves until after their third baby, which they’re having via surrogate, is born. As the source says, she’s totally fine raising the little one as a single mother. She’s Kim effing Kardashian!  “[Their divorce] will be all-out war,” the insider told Star. Kim has reportedly asked Kanye to sign a “mid-nuptial agreement” to protect her assets. Factoring in their revenue, from Kanye’s music, the KUWTK empire, and Kim’s various deals, including KKW beauty, it could be a $1 billion divorce!

HollywoodLifers, do you think Kim and Kanye are really divorcing? Let us know!","Kim Kardashian, esteemed public figure, is said to be facing a challenging situation within her marital home alongside husband Kanye West. Reliable sources have revealed that Kim has been grappling with the aftermath of Kanye's distressing breakdown in November 2016, causing her considerable distress. In light of these difficulties, it is reported that Kim is unable to perceive a resolution to their challenges, as shared by an individual familiar with the matter in an interview with Star Magazine. According to this insider, Kanye's audacious self-importance and unpredictable mood swings have created an overwhelming burden for Kim, who is already encompassed by the responsibilities of raising their two children and preparing for the arrival of their third via a surrogate. Despite her efforts to endure these tribulations, Kim's emotional and mental well-being has reached its limit, rendering her unable to continue. The toll of witnessing a loved one, especially one's spouse, endure such a profound health crisis is unimaginable. Kim's current state of stress may intensify if the reports of an impending divorce prove to be veracious. However, it has been purported that Kim intends to postpone any firm decisions until after the birth of their third child. As stated by the source, should the separation become inevitable, Kim is prepared to raise their newborn as a single parent, confident in her ability to provide adequate care. It is disheartening to contemplate the possible consequences of this dissolution, as the source predicts a tumultuous legal battle to ensue, potentially resulting in a financially significant divorce of up to one billion dollars. Regrettably, this decision weighs heavily upon Kim's heart, as disclosed by the insider. Despite the impending separation, a recent source has disclosed that Kim and Kanye have maintained an appearance of unity by including their daughter, North West, in discussions concerning her anticipated younger sister.

Diana Falzone  More Kim Kardashian and Beyonce Feud","The longevity of Kimye's relationship may be called into question if Kanye's close friends, Jay-Z and Beyonce, continue to distance themselves from Kim. This was made evident during the recent BET awards, where Jay-Z seemed to barely acknowledge Kim while accepting his award alongside Kanye. As important collaborators and intimate friends, Jay-Z's stance on Kim could potentially affect the couple's future. 

Regrettably, Kim cannot control whether or not Kanye's friends like her. It falls upon Kanye to assert boundaries with his buddies and make it clear that treating his girlfriend poorly is unacceptable. If his friends persist in rejecting Kim, Kanye may have to distance himself from them until they recognize that he and Kim are a package deal. 

It is crucial to acknowledge that Jay-Z and Beyonce may have preconceived notions about Kim and the Kardashian family, without truly knowing her as an individual. If they are able to discard their judgmental lenses, there is a possibility that they could develop a liking or, at the very least, a tolerance for her presence within their social circle. 

It is important to remember that when a friend finds happiness with a new partner, it is essential to refrain from harboring negativity. There is a strong likelihood that friendships may be compromised in the process.

E-mail Address Subscribe","Following the public announcement of Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux's separation, which coincided with the release of an Architectural Digest feature showcasing their stunning midcentury home in Los Angeles, the news generated interest but did not reach the magnitude of other celebrity breakups. The couple's marriage, that lasted less than three years, a significant duration in the Hollywood industry, received attention from tabloids for a brief period. 

However, for those still pondering over Aniston's happiness, it is imperative to respect her wish for privacy. Reputable sources, including Us Weekly, reveal that she has moved on and is currently exploring new romantic connections with two individuals. Notably, neither of them is from the acting profession. One gentleman is reported to be a recently divorced bachelor, while the other is described as an ""industry creative,"" although the exact nature of their profession remains undisclosed.

Nevertheless, it is unlikely that further details will be revealed in the near future. Back in July 2016, Aniston expressed her exasperation in a powerful op-ed for HuffPost, addressing the invasive nature of the paparazzi and the incessant focus on her personal life, love affairs, and potential motherhood. In her own words, she firmly stated, ""For the record, I am not pregnant. What I am is fed up. I'm fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body-shaming that occurs daily under the guise of 'journalism,' the 'First Amendment,' and 'celebrity news.'""

Therefore, the latest developments indicate that Jennifer Aniston is content and actively dating, which is undoubtedly positive news. It is now crucial to respect her privacy and shift our attention to discussing other topics, such as Justin Theroux's acquaintances in the South of France, particularly someone with an exceptional hot tub.

Relationships can be tumultuous, and when it comes to the romance between Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez, it's been seven years of ups and downs. These two young stars captured the hearts of their fan bases and sparked the iconic #Jelena hashtag. Given their immense fame, their admirers range from loyal supporters to fanatical devotees. Tracking their relationship can be quite challenging, but fear not, as we have meticulously dissected every breakup and reconciliation. Take a seat and get comfortable, because there is a lot to delve into.

In January 2011, the dating rumors surrounding Bieber and Gomez began to circulate. By that same month, the pop stars confirmed their romance with a display of public affection during a vacation in St. Lucia. Their love story was further solidified when they walked the red carpet together for the first time at the Vanity Fair Oscars party in February 2011. Their youthful adoration was on full display at the Billboard Music Awards in May 2011.

Rumors started to circulate in November 2011, suggesting that Gomez had ended the relationship. These rumors stemmed from a Bieber fan's claim that she had slept with him backstage at a show and that he was the father of her child. However, these speculations were eventually debunked. It wasn't until November 2012 that the couple officially broke up, with Bieber briefly being linked to model Barbara Palvin. But don't worry, this was just the first of many breakups.

In January 2013, less than three months after their initial split, Bieber posted a photo of him and Gomez on his Instagram, signaling a possible reconciliation. However, the image was swiftly deleted, leaving fans guessing. At the American Music Awards in November 2014, Gomez performed her single ""The Heart Wants What It Wants"" and openly confirmed that it was about Bieber. The couple made a few more on-again, off-again appearances in the media before officially calling it quits.

In December 2014, Bieber denied dating rumors with model Hailey Baldwin, leading to the rise of the ""Jailey"" ship. Around the same time, Gomez sparked dating rumors with DJ Zedd in January 2015. In September 2015, she opened up about her past relationship with Bieber, expressing her continued support for him. Bieber himself acknowledged their history when he appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in November 2015, revealing which songs from his album Purpose were inspired by Selena.

The roller-coaster continued in January 2016 with Bieber and Baldwin spending New Year's Eve together. However, their romance was short-lived, and they eventually broke up. In August 2016, Bieber was seen with Sofia Richie, and Gomez posted a clip of her singing DJ Snake's ""Let Me Love You,"" a song that features Bieber. Confusion arose, considering her recent feud with Richie, but Gomez's actions remained her own.

November 2016 brought rumors of Bieber visiting Gomez in rehab. Gomez had pulled out of her Revival Tour earlier that year due to complications from Lupus, resulting in anxiety and panic. Meanwhile, in January 2017, Gomez was spotted with Canadian singer The Weeknd, indicating a new chapter in her love life.

The saga of Jelena, as it has come to be known, might be reaching its conclusion. However, with these two celebrities, anything is possible. Only time will tell what the future holds for Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez.",rewrite_generation
gossipcop-2388806885,"R. Kelly’s time may have finally come. R. Kelly has been accused of sexual relationships with minors going back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah. (The marriage was annulled.) In the 24 years since then, he has been sued multiple times for inappropriate sexual contact with a minor (he settled out of court every time), and he was eventually charged with creating child pornography. (A jury found him not guilty on the grounds that they could not conclusively identify the other figure in his infamous sex tape as a child.) Last summer, he was accused of creating an abusive “sex cult” of very young women, whom he allegedly isolates, brainwashes, and abuses physically and emotionally. Since the story broke, multiple women have added their own testimonies of abuse at R. Kelly’s hands. (Through a lawyer, Kelly denied all accusations, saying he would “work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.”) And in April, another woman accused Kelly of “knowingly and intentionally infecting her with an STD.” Her lawyers say they are currently preparing a federal civil lawsuit.

This year, he’s touring with singer Charlie Wilson (some protests are planned). His music appeared in Pitch Perfect 3.

But Staples’s interviewer only giggled nervously and protested, “We can’t ever talk about this guy. ... You’re about to get me fired from Coachella.

But if that’s the case, those consequences took more than two decades to reach him. There is a persistent vagueness to the way we talk about R. Kelly that makes it possible to forget exactly what he’s been accused of, how often he’s been accused, and how much proof there is against him. And most likely, that’s because his alleged victims are overwhelmingly young black women and hence apparently easy for America to ignore. “The saddest fact I’ve learned is: Nobody matters less to our society than young black women,” says Jim DeRogatis, the reporter who broke the R. Kelly story. “Nobody.” To try to combat that vagueness and the erasure that it makes possible, here is a timeline of all of the accusations of sexual misconduct against R. Kelly. Much of the chronology here is drawn from DeRogatis’s invaluable coverage of the R. Kelly accusations, including his own immensely thorough timeline. DeRogatis’s timeline covers the entire span of Kelly’s life, including his major career milestones and unrelated legal issues, but I’ve narrowed the focus of this timeline to specifically the sexual misconduct accusations against Kelly. Over the 24-year span of this timeline, a consistent pattern emerges. Over and over again, Kelly is accused of the same behavior: of targeting girls and very young women, isolating them, and controlling and abusing them. And after the dust from the accusation settles, Kelly goes on living his life with very few changes. Here, from Aaliyah to the alleged sex cult, are all the R. Kelly accusations. August 30, 1994: 27-year-old R. Kelly marries 15-year-old Aaliyah The ’90s music sensation Aaliyah was Kelly’s protégé. They met when she was 12 years old, and Kelly wrote and produced her first album in 1993. It was titled Age Ain’t Nothing but a Number. In 1995, Vibe magazine published a copy of their marriage license, with 15-year-old Aaliyah falsely listing her age as 18. “Family members say Aaliyah thought it was all an elaborate ‘game,’ and she just went along with it,” the Chicago Sun-Times later reported, adding that the marriage license was reportedly obtained by Kelly’s assistant, using a fake ID. “Within hours, she realized what had happened, and she went to her family and sought their help.” The marriage was annulled in 1994, just months after the ceremony. In the settlement, according to documents obtained by the Sun-Times, Aaliyah promises not to pursue further legal action because of “emotional distress caused","R. Kelly’s alleged misconduct, particularly in regard to sexual relationships with minors, has recently been receiving increased attention. These accusations stretch back to 1994 when he infamously married pop star Aaliyah, who was only 15 years old at the time (the marriage was later annulled). Throughout the past 24 years, Kelly has faced multiple lawsuits related to inappropriate sexual contact with minors, all of which were settled out of court. Additionally, he was charged with creating child pornography, although he was found not guilty due to discrepancies in identifying the individuals involved. Most recently, Kelly has been accused of establishing an abusive ""sex cult"" consisting of young women whom he allegedly isolates, manipulates, and abuses both physically and emotionally.

Since these allegations came to light, several women have added their own testimonies of abuse at the hands of R. Kelly. Kelly, through his lawyer, has denied all the accusations, vowing to clear his name by diligently pursuing his accusers. In April, another woman came forward claiming that Kelly intentionally infected her with a sexually transmitted disease, and her legal team is currently preparing a federal civil lawsuit. Kelly, however, has categorically denied these claims as well.

With the ongoing #MeToo movement and the increased awareness surrounding sexual misconduct, it is natural to question why R. Kelly's career has remained relatively unaffected despite decades of lawsuits and allegations. While many high-profile individuals have faced significant consequences for their actions, such as losing their jobs or retiring from public life, Kelly's career has continued to thrive. He completed an arena tour last year, albeit with a few cancellations, and is currently touring with singer Charlie Wilson, albeit with planned protests. Furthermore, his music recently appeared in the film Pitch Perfect 3. Rapper Vince Staples even publicly referred to Kelly as a ""child molester"" during an interview, but the subject was avoided and brushed off.

However, there are signs that this stasis may finally be changing for R. Kelly. The BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes, brought renewed attention to the allegations against him. Moreover, several members of his inner circle, including his assistant, accountant, lawyer, and representative, have publicly distanced themselves from him, suggesting that his alleged misconduct played a role in their departures. DJ Phantom, his longtime musical accompanist, was particularly candid in his departure, expressing regret for not realizing the truth sooner and describing Kelly as a ""shitbag.""

In April, the Women of Color committee within Time's Up endorsed the #MuteRKelly campaign, urging companies like Spotify, Ticketmaster, and RCA to sever ties with Kelly. Spotify responded by announcing that they would no longer promote his music, though it would still be available on their streaming platform. These recent developments indicate that R. Kelly may finally face lasting consequences for his alleged actions, although it took more than two decades for this to occur.

To combat the vagueness and erasure surrounding R. Kelly's accusations, it is crucial to provide a comprehensive timeline of his alleged sexual misconduct. This includes his marriage to Aaliyah in 1994, the subsequent accusations heard through the years, and his recent involvement in the alleged sex cult. By shedding light on this timeline, it becomes apparent that one consistent pattern emerges: Kelly is repeatedly accused of targeting young girls and women, controlling and abusing them, and then continuing with his life relatively unscathed once the dust settles. It is troubling to observe that his alleged victims, who are predominately young black women, appear to be overlooked by American society.

In conclusion, the numerous accusations and evidence against R. Kelly paint a disturbing picture of his alleged misconduct. While it has taken a considerable amount of time for the consequences to catch up with him, recent developments suggest that change might finally be on the horizon. However, it is essential to remember the individuals who have come forward and bravely shared their stories, as they highlight the urgent need for accountability and justice in cases of sexual misconduct.",rewrite_generation

Speaking in an interview with Task & Purpose, Wahlberg expressed his belief that many celebrities should refrain from engaging in such political discourse. 

In his own words, Wahlberg highlighted the limited impact that celebrity opinions have on the general public, stating, ""You know, it just goes to show you that people aren't listening to that anyways. They might buy your CD or watch your movie, but you don't put food on their table. You don't pay their bills."" Drawing attention to the potential disconnect between Hollywood and the average citizen, he emphasized the importance of understanding the realities faced by ordinary individuals who work tirelessly to support their families.

Wahlberg, speaking from personal experience, noted his awareness of the dichotomy between the glitz and glamour of Hollywood and the starkness of everyday life. He acknowledged his ability to navigate the complexities of the entertainment industry while remaining grounded in the real world, humbly recalling his own journey from relatively modest circumstances. The actor aptly calls upon his peers to consider their privileges and the potential isolation that comes with living in what he refers to as a ""bubble.""

Wahlberg raises a valid point regarding the suitability of Hollywood liberals as political commentators. He advocates for a respectful approach towards the President of the United States, arguing that those in the entertainment industry should exercise caution when expressing their political beliefs. By extending this plea, Wahlberg encourages celebrities to foster a climate of consideration and respect, recognizing the significance of their platforms and how their words can contribute to public discourse.

It is worth considering Wahlberg's perspective on this matter. What qualifications truly make Hollywood liberals authoritative figures in political discussions? In the interest of maintaining a respectful discourse, should there not be an appropriate level of regard for the elected President of the United States?",rewrite_generation

However, their romance took a rocky turn around Bieber’s birthday on March 1, according to reports.","According to an exclusive source from HollywoodLife.com, Justin Bieber is currently facing difficulties coping with the temporary pause in his relationship with Selena Gomez. While Gomez enjoys her vacation in Sydney, Australia, as depicted in a carefree video, Bieber's mind is consumed by thoughts of her. Despite his efforts to distract himself by spending time with friends and engaging in personal activities, he cannot escape his constant preoccupation with Gomez. The source reveals that Bieber yearns to be in her presence, to communicate with her, and to be connected to her in any way possible. He has become reliant on her presence, comparing it to a potent drug that he craves endlessly.

As Bieber continues to grapple with their separation, he has devised plans for their reunion in Los Angeles. Upon her return, he eagerly anticipates demonstrating his affection by arranging special outings and romantic gestures to rekindle their relationship. Unfortunately, it remains uncertain when Gomez will return to the West Coast. Nevertheless, her Instagram posts portray a joyous and carefree experience, accompanied by a cryptic message suggesting her focus on self-care and a disregard for impressing others. Could this be an indication of her mindset following their recent split?

After witnessing Gomez photographed alongside an Australian man, Johnny Rays, on a boat on March 19, fans of the couple were sent into a state of panic. Although the photos imply a friendly relationship between Gomez and Rays, some fans interpreted their closeness as cause for concern.

Amid Gomez's vacation, Bieber has been keeping himself occupied by engaging in physical activities. Candid shots depict him participating in hockey and soccer games with his friends. However, the emotional toll of their separation seems to have affected him as evident by his severe fall during a soccer match on March 19 and what appears to be a breakdown on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.

It is worth noting that Jelena, as they are known to their devoted followers, reunited in October 2017 following Gomez's split from The Weeknd. Their bond appeared unbreakable, even celebrating New Year's together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, reports indicate that their relationship faced challenges coinciding with Bieber's birthday on March 1.",rewrite_generation

Madonna was hit with a series of “uncomfortable questions” by a judge before she was granted permission to adopt her 4-year-old twin girls from Malawi, the presiding judge said in court documents obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, February 8.  “The petitioner is a professional performer and I guarded myself against the danger of her merely reciting a well-rehearsed speech by asking her some rather uncomfortable questions to which she gave very candid answers,” Judge Fiona Mwale said in her ruling, explaining her reasons for approving the adoption.  After pressing Madonna, 58, to explain her intentions in adding two more little ones to her brood of four, Judge Mwale said she was satisfied that the girls would be in good hands with the Material Girl.  “There is no doubt that the petitioner can offer the infants not only the best education money can buy, but also guidance with a high likelihood of ensuring that the two infants grow to be self-sufficient adults,” Judge Mwale said, adding that she is satisfied that Madonna “is motivated by her desire to offer a home, love, protection and guidance to the infants.”  In the court documents, Judge Mwale addressed prior controversies surrounding Madonna’s adoptions in Malawi. “In determining her motives, I questioned the petitioner at length about the impact of her decision which could be construed as robbing Malawi of its most precious resource, its children,” the judge wrote.  As previously reported, Madonna filed for adoption in High Court in Malawi on January 25 but tried to keep the process under wraps until a final decision was made. (The Queen of Pop issued a statement denying her adoption to Us Weekly that same day, claiming that she was in Malawi “to check on the children’s hospital in Blantyre.”) According to the AP, she has already raised $7.5 million for a pediatric surgery ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, which is set to open early next year.  Madonna previously adopted son David and daughter Mercy James, both 11, from Malawi in 2008 and 2009, respectively. She is also mom to daughter Lourdes, 20, whom she shares with ex Carlos Leon, and son Rocco, 16, whom she shares with ex-husband Guy Ritchie.  Madonna’s twin girls will retain their birth names as a part of an effort to preserve their identity as Malawian nationals, the court documents said, and their father was at the January 25 court hearing with Madonna. (The twins’ mother died within a week of childbirth due to health complications.)  On Wednesday, February 8, Madonna took to social media to share the happy news. “I can officially confirm I have completed the process of adopting twin sisters from Malawi and am overjoyed that they are now part of our family,” she captioned an image of herself walking between the two little girls. “I am deeply grateful to all those in Malawi who helped make this possible, and I ask the media please to respect our privacy during this transitional time. 🙏🏻 Thank you also to my friends, family and my very large team for all your support and Love!”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

One strategy they have employed is increasing the frequency of their date nights in order to spend quality time together while also respecting each other's personal space during the day. It seems that this approach has been successful to some extent, as there have been recent sightings of DeGenres and de Rossi out and about together.

Considering the stress Robert endured as a result of his fame from the Twilight series, we can only imagine the impact the highly publicized photos of Kristen Stewart kissing her movie producer, while they were still together, had on him. Expressing this sentiment, the insider adds, ""He's shown immense growth and has become a profoundly serious young man. Rob is disappointed that Charlie [Hunnam] has not given up his marijuana habit.

But from day one there was open communication with Ricky about what I had gone through.

While millions of people had witnessed her previous engagement to Chris Soules on national television, this proposal was a surprise that left Bischoff truly shocked and overwhelmed with joy. Reflecting upon the moment, she shares, ""It was just perfect. Ricky got me good! I was so happy that I couldn’t quit smiling. My cheeks hurt!""

Bischoff, a 31-year-old fertility nurse, and Angel, a sales manager, initially connected on the dating app Bumble in September of last year. They quickly formed a deep connection, and by May, the couple decided to move in together. Recalling their first date, Bischoff explains, ""On our first date, we just clicked. It was easy and that’s the way it should be.""

However, Bischoff admits that returning to the dating scene after her painful split from Soules in 2015 was a challenging experience. She was still in the process of healing and trying to rebuild her life. Yet, with Ricky, she found solace in open communication, sharing her past experiences and emotions without judgment. This vulnerability contributed to the rapid development of their love. Bischoff expresses, ""I think one of the reasons I fell in love so quickly is that I could say everything and know I was not being judged.""

Although Bischoff and Soules have not spoken recently, she sincerely wishes him well, hoping that he finds someone who is as great for him as Ricky is for her. While she still follows The Bachelor, Bischoff mentions that she has moved on from her own reality show past. She states, ""That journey was a big part of my life. But since I’ve met Ricky, I really haven’t looked back.""

Currently, Bischoff is busy with her wedding plans, targeting a date in the next fall. Despite her positive associations with the show, she acknowledges that its ending was not ideal. Nonetheless, she didn't let her past experiences close her heart to finding the perfect someone. As she confidently asserts, ""Everything works out for a reason.""",rewrite_generation

In a recent interview with ET, Wilkerson opened up about Bieber, whom he describes as the most talented person he knows. 

Wilkerson acknowledges that Bieber's rapid rise to fame and his childhood spent in the spotlight have presented unique challenges for him. He believes that anyone thrust into the limelight inevitably faces scrutiny, with both their good and bad actions being exploited. 

However, Wilkerson emphasizes that people should not be treated as projects with expiration dates. Instead, he believes that people are eternal beings and that our role is to love, encourage, and affirm one another. According to Wilkerson, Bieber possesses a kind and genuine heart.

He has been actively promoting his latest album, Purpose, while repeatedly acknowledging and apologizing for his past actions. 

Bieber's recent highly-acclaimed live performances and record sales suggest that he has succeeded in finding the forgiveness he has sought.

Trivial observations, such as a photo of Aniston placing her hand on her stomach, have been enough for certain tabloids to speculate about her becoming a mother. In the latest issue of Star magazine, the headline reads, ""Jen To Justin: I'll Raise Our Baby Alone!"" The article claims that Aniston, desiring motherhood, has hired a surrogate and is prepared to embark on this journey with or without her husband. Allegedly, Aniston confided in an anonymous source, disclosing her troubled marriage and her commitment to raise the child as a single parent.

However, this account quickly loses credibility when contradictory statements are mentioned. The insider claims that Aniston is actively searching for the right surrogate, which contradicts their previous assertion. This discrepancy raises doubts regarding the authenticity of the claim.

Many individuals view this tabloid story as entirely false, as the contradictory statements within the article suggest a lack of truthfulness. Additionally, the insider's decision to share such private and secretive information with a tabloid raises questions about their motives and credibility. This particular publication has a history of publishing misleading stories; earlier this year, they claimed Aniston was pregnant, only to disregard this in their recent article.

Aniston has openly expressed her views on these pregnancy tabloids in an interview with Glamour magazine in August. She explained that these stories engage in body shaming and violate the privacy she shares with her husband. Aniston firmly asserted that whether or not she has a baby is no one's business but her own. She emphasized that the decision to have a child is a personal matter, and individuals should refrain from passing judgment on others.

Ultimately, Jennifer Aniston reminds us that each person's choices regarding parenthood are unique and should be respected. Behind closed doors, nobody truly knows the complexities and intricacies of another person's life.",rewrite_generation
gossipcop-5840642713,"Sky high prices are reportedly keeping fans from buying tickets to Taylor Swift’s upcoming Reputation tour, per a story by the New York Post. Though her 1989 world tour boasted numerous sold out performances (it eventually became the highest grossing tour of 2015), it appears her considerably more expensive snake persona is a tougher sell.  Last month, her “longtime” tour promoter told Billboard, “By the time all the tickets are sold next week, I’ll be celebrating Taylor’s birthday with a cocktail in my hand and sold-out concerts all over the world.” But her birthday has come and gone, and not one date has sold out.  Reputation was the biggest-selling album of 2017 and the tour is shaping up to be far from ill-attended, so the Post’s headline, “Taylor Swift’s Reputation tour shaping up to be a disaster,” is a little much. It does, however, highlight the problems with unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and Ticketmaster in general.  The company’s “Verified Fan” program, which they would like you to believe is all about rewarding music lovers, appears to be nothing but a cash grab that takes advantage of Swift-obsessed teens with easy access to their parents’ credit card numbers.

Though her 1989 world tour boasted numerous sold out performances (it eventually became the highest grossing tour of 2015), it appears her considerably more expensive snake persona is a tougher sell.  Last month, her “longtime” tour promoter told Billboard, “By the time all the tickets are sold next week, I’ll be celebrating Taylor’s birthday with a cocktail in my hand and sold-out concerts all over the world.” But her birthday has come and gone, and not one date has sold out.  Reputation was the biggest-selling album of 2017 and the tour is shaping up to be far from ill-attended, so the Post’s headline, “Taylor Swift’s Reputation tour shaping up to be a disaster,” is a little much.

This comes as a surprise, considering her previous 1989 world tour was immensely successful, becoming the highest grossing tour of 2015. However, it seems that her current persona as a more expensive and edgy artist is proving to be a tougher sell.

Just last month, a tour promoter, who has worked with Swift for a long time, confidently stated to Billboard that all tickets would be sold out by Taylor's birthday, with concerts around the world sold out as well. However, Taylor's birthday has passed and not a single date on her tour has sold out.

Despite this, it is important to note that Reputation was the top-selling album of 2017, indicating that the tour is expected to have a decent turnout. Therefore, while the Post's headline claiming that the tour is shaping up to be a disaster may be an exaggeration, it does bring attention to certain issues such as unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and the role of Ticketmaster in general.

Ticketmaster's ""Verified Fan"" program, which is supposed to reward music lovers, appears to be more focused on profit rather than providing a fair opportunity to fans. The program allegedly takes advantage of teens who are obsessed with Swift and have easy access to their parents' credit card numbers. By spending money on merchandise, fans can supposedly improve their chances of getting better positions in the ticket queue. However, once the tickets are accessible, they often turn out to be too expensive for many fans to afford.

A fan mentioned in the Post article shared that they had paid $150 for their ticket with excellent seats during the 1989 tour. Now, for similar seating, they are expected to pay around $500. This significant increase in ticket prices is certainly a cause for concern.

On a related note, it is worth mentioning that tickets for Katy Perry's upcoming show in New Orleans are currently available starting at $23.",rewrite_generation

gossipcop-6225895099,"Chris Soules, former star of ABC’s “The Bachelor,” after his arrest. (Buchanan County Sheriff via AP) Iowa farmer Chris Soules, a former star on ABC’s “The Bachelor” who charmed reality TV viewers with his small-town life, was arrested this week after police said he fled a crash that killed a fellow farmer. Soules, 35, was charged with leaving the scene of a fatal crash, a class D felony, and could face up to five years in prison if he is convicted. The case has garnered the attention of Soules’s “Bachelor” fans as well as residents of Arlington, Iowa, where he lives, who had come to appreciate the reality TV star’s work as an unofficial Iowa ambassador and farm industry advocate. “This story is going to spread like wildfire around here and probably all over because of who he is,” Mary Jo Brown, Arlington’s city clerk, told the Des Moines Register. “Sometimes fame isn’t your friend.” Soules, who also appeared in “Dancing with the Stars” and “Worst Chefs in America,” called 911 at 8:20 p.m. Monday evening to report that he had rear-ended a tractor on a rural road north of the tiny town of Aurora, about six miles away from his home. The tractor veered into a ditch after being struck by his 2008 Chevrolet Silverado, Soules said. The tractor driver — later identified as 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, a Vietnam War veteran — was unconscious and not breathing, Soules told the 911 operator, according to audio obtained by local media. The man had a pulse, but there was blood around his mouth, Soules said. Soules identified himself on the call, which lasted nearly six minutes, and sounded frantic. Between heavy breathing, he answered the dispatcher’s questions and took instructions. Soules told the 911 operator he did not know how to perform CPR and could be heard asking unidentified people at the scene if they could perform the lifesaving measure. The call ended abruptly after the operator told Soules law enforcement and medical first responders were on the way. “Can I, can I call you back really quick?” Soules asked the dispatcher. “Yeah, you can call me back,” she says. “Thank you,” Soules responds. Soules left the crash site after emergency responders arrived, but before deputies with the Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office were on the scene, according to authorities. Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Scott Bright told the Des Moines Register that Soules fled the scene on foot and later got into a truck. In police audio obtained by local media, a deputy told a dispatcher that Soules “took off” in a red truck. Authorities are trying to identify who picked up Soules in the truck, Buchanan County Sheriff Bill Wolfgram told the Associated Press. That person could face charges, he said. Alcohol was found at the scene and investigators are trying to determine whose it was and whether it or speed were factors in the crash. Soules was arrested about five hours after the incident and booked into the Buchanan County Jail, the Associated Press reported. He posted a $10,000 bond Tuesday morning and was released on the condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic monitor.

The following year, he received three citations for fighting and noise, unlawful use of a license and leaving the scene, which was amended down to defective brakes, court documents showed. Then in 2005, Soules was charged with driving while intoxicated and received one year of probation. A statement from Soules’s publicist earlier this week said he was “devastated” to learn that Mosher had died from the crash and that his “thoughts and prayers” were with the man’s family. Mosher, a lifelong resident of Aurora — population 200 — lived on his family farm near the crash site, reported the Argus Leader. He was married to his high school sweetheart, Nancy, and the couple had two sons and three grandchildren, according to Mosher’s obituary. An Army veteran, Mosher served six years, including a tour in Vietnam. He farmed his entire life and was a member of the Aurora American Legion and the Iowa Corn Growers Association. “Kenny loved playing golf, farming and spending his winters in Florida biking and visiting his mother,” Mosher’s obituary said. “His family was most important to him, especially his grandchildren.” In northeast Iowa, where Mosher and Soules both farmed, community members told local media they were heartbroken for the families of both men.

He later competed on “Dancing with the Stars” and the Food Network’s “Worst Chefs in America.” Soules has since made guest appearances on various “Bachelor” franchise spin-offs shows and was rumored to be a cast member for this summer’s taping of “Bachelor in Paradise,” where former contestants search for love on","Chris Soules, the former star of ABC’s “The Bachelor,” was arrested this week following a fatal crash in Iowa.

Despite their attempts at mending their marriage through couples therapy after halting a potential divorce, it seems that their efforts have not yielded the desired results. Although the official reason given is Kanye's snoring, insiders reveal that there are deeper underlying issues at play.

According to an insider close to the couple, the once vibrant spark that defined their relationship has vanished, and Kim, burdened by the demands of parenting two young children and another on the way, confesses that she no longer possesses the time or energy to revive the passion in their bedroom. Meanwhile, Kanye, hoping for a miracle, resigns himself to a sexless marriage with a heavy heart.

Throughout their public union, Kim Kardashian, now 36 years old, stood by her husband's side when he faced a highly publicized meltdown last year. Despite her unwavering support, their marriage has never fully recovered from the aftermath. Adding to their challenges, Kim continues to grapple with the emotional aftermath of her notorious Paris robbery while juggling her roles as a mother, reality star, and managing her vast business empire. On the other hand, Kanye's music career has hit a standstill after his departure from the Tidal music streaming service, entangled in a complex legal dispute with Jay-Z.

The strains on their relationship are undeniable, and significant decisions like sleeping apart symbolize the obstacles they currently face. As the couple navigates this delicate period, their fans and the public at large await news of any positive developments.

I always get notes, ‘Hurry home!’ When I get there, there’s always something kind of great waiting for me, some plan, and I try to reciprocate.”  RELATED CONTENT:  Barbra Streisand Calls Out Golden Globes for Not Awarding More Female Directors  ‘Girls Trip' Star Tiffany Haddish Says She Taught Barbra Streisand All About Cardi B  Josh Brolin on His Ripped Bod and How He Knew Wife Kathyrn Boyd Was the One (Exclusive)  Related Gallery","James Brolin and Barbra Streisand are approaching their 20th wedding anniversary, a testament to the strength of their enduring bond. In a recent interview with ET's Katie Krause, Brolin shared insights into their successful marriage, acknowledging that despite their long romance, he doesn't have all the answers. With his previous experiences in mind, he emphasized the importance of learning from past mistakes and growing with each relationship.

Brolin emphasized that he firmly believes in the power of marriage counseling, suggesting that it can provide a valuable perspective and help resolve conflicts. By bringing in a third party to facilitate open communication, he believes that many marital issues can be successfully addressed and ultimately resolved.

One key aspect of maintaining their marital harmony is Brolin's understanding and respect for Streisand's busy schedule. He recognizes that during periods of intense focus and productivity, interruptions can be detrimental. Therefore, he makes a conscious effort to respect her space and time. Likewise, when he seeks her attention, he understands that her unavailability is non-negotiable and does not take it personally.

When asked about the ways in which Streisand makes him feel special, Brolin mentioned the warmth and love he receives upon returning home. Whether through thoughtful notes or exciting plans, Streisand ensures that he feels valued and cherished. In return, Brolin endeavors to reciprocate these gestures, striving to create an atmosphere of mutual care and appreciation. 

The enduring love story of James Brolin and Barbra Streisand serves as an inspiration to all, showcasing the beauty and potential of a committed and supportive union. Despite the uncertainties that come with any relationship, their dedication to each other and their willingness to grow and adapt contribute to the continued success of their partnership.",rewrite_generation

This preoccupation with her routine has become tiresome for those close to her, including Vito Schnabel, often leading him to seek frequent breaks from their relationship. It appears that Heidi's youthful appearance requires more effort than previously assumed. However, her insistence on flaunting her perceived perfection has become a point of contention for her loved ones. An additional annoyance stems from Heidi's attempts to portray herself as ordinary, even going so far as to simulate indulging in junk food while in front of the camera. In reality, she has not consumed a burger in years. Given that she recently spent time in Italy with her boyfriend, it remains unknown how she managed to avoid pasta and pizza during their trip. The insider remarks that conversations with Heidi predominantly revolve around her workout routine and her daily food intake, which typically consists of no more than a few nuts and steamed kale. Such discussions hardly sound enjoyable.",rewrite_generation

While it is true that they often spend time apart, this is due to various reasons and not because they have broken up or are taking a break. In fact, they were seen leaving church together in Los Angeles just recently, although in separate vehicles. It is important to note that despite their continued commitment, their relationship, like any other, is not without its challenges. They have overcome several obstacles since they started dating in 2010 and have had an on-again, off-again relationship until 2015. However, they reconnected last year and have chosen to keep their relationship private, allowing Selena to prioritize her health issues and personal needs. As a sufferer of lupus and a recent kidney transplant recipient, the 25-year-old singer has been working hard to take care of herself and make decisions that are in her best interest. Contrary to any speculation, Justin has been supportive and understanding of Selena's circumstances. It is worth mentioning that Selena's family, particularly her mother, Mandy Teefey, has had reservations about their reunion due to past ups and downs. This ongoing conflict continues to affect Selena's relationship with Justin. However, if they are able to resolve these issues or if her family's perspective changes, it could greatly improve the dynamics of their relationship. Despite these challenges, Selena publicly acknowledged their rekindled romance for the first time on Justin's 24th birthday, hinting at their deep connection and shared humor.

Angie be careful what you wish for. Seems like 6 kids are going to be without a mom and dad in one place. Good luck with that","After attending the Academy Awards show, Jen's relationship with Brad took a negative turn. Previously, Angelina Jolie had made significant efforts to keep Brad away from Jen, going to great lengths to prevent any semblance of friendship between them. Her constant traveling was motivated by her desire to isolate Pitt from any potential connections. This extended to his own family as well. It was only a matter of time before this strategy backfired. Brad took longer than expected, but eventually saw the truth behind Angelina's extreme mental instability. This is likely why their children are not enrolled in school; she shares this same possessiveness over them. Angelina had likely believed her hold on Brad would last, given her confidence in her own attractiveness. However, her mistreatment and dismissal of Holly, who served as their surrogate, opened Brad's eyes to her manipulative ways. Furthermore, Jen's claims of constant communication with Brad made it evident that Angelina herself was still in contact with her exes. Years of trying to convince Brad that Jen was unworthy of him finally unraveled, as he realized the truth. Angelina's tactics of manipulation are no longer effective. Reports suggest that she possesses an intense jealousy and cannot tolerate Brad even glancing at an attractive woman. It is clear how challenging this can be. The National Enquirer claims that Brad is relieved to be separated from her. As Brad's closest friendships are with women, this would naturally create tension for Angelina, who begrudges sharing him. Angelina's decision to take on a film role greatly angered Brad, as she had promised to prioritize her role as a mother. It is apparent that she acts according to her own will, regardless of their agreement. Although they have twin babies, her commitment to bonding with them appears minimal. It is perplexing that any woman would not cherish the opportunity to spend quality time with her newborns. Such behavior is indeed troubling. The only thing preventing Brad from finalizing their separation is their children. Angelina should be cautious of her desires, as it seems that six kids may find themselves without the presence of both parents in one location. She will undoubtedly face challenges in managing this situation.",rewrite_generation

And while a lot of it may be down to great genes, Lopez has revealed in a new interview some of her beauty secrets and yep, they’re as diva as you might expect.  Lopez credits her glow to positive affirmations, revealing she says one in particular to herself every day to keep her radiant, youthful look intact.  So what is this magic phrase?  “I am youthful and timeless at every age,” Lopez says every single day—but it’s not enough to just say the mantra daily, because Lopez also has a handful of pillows with these words and more mantras embroidered into them all over her home. “I tell myself that every day, a few times a day.

Australian-born Dr Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, co-authored The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer, with anti-aging psychologist Dr Elissa Epel, which investigated the link between telomeres, which protect our chromosomes, and the effect stress, sleep and diet can have on telomeres and how that directly corresponds with our health.  The book asserts there is a correlation between depression and anxiety and shorter telomeres and that “when pessimists develop an aging-related illness, like cancer or heart disease, the illness tends to progress faster.”  And really there's only so far a little highlight can go, step one is all about a positive attitude. Step two is to find yourself a great pillowcase and settle on your new mantra.  So what’s the lesson here? Your inner glow is only a glass half full attitude away.","Jennifer Lopez, at the age of 48, possesses a remarkable physique and awe-inspiring skin that has captivated the attention of many. While some may attribute her beauty solely to her genetic makeup, Lopez has recently shared her beauty secrets in a revealing interview. These secrets, while perhaps channeling her diva persona, have proven to be effective in maintaining her radiant and youthful appearance.

One of the key factors that Lopez credits for her luminosity is the practice of positive affirmations. Every day, without fail, she recites a specific mantra to herself to uphold her youthful and timeless appearance. However, uttering these words alone is not enough for Lopez. She remains surrounded by a collection of pillows, adorned with various mantras, strategically placed throughout her home. By reinforcing her affirmations multiple times a day, Lopez firmly believes that age is merely a state of mind, referencing the timeless beauty of Jane Fonda as evidence.

Before we dismiss Lopez's positive mindset as mere whimsicality, it is important to acknowledge the scientific research that emphasizes the impact of negative thoughts on the aging process. The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer, authored by Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, and anti-aging psychologist Dr. Elissa Epel, delves into the connection between telomeres and various lifestyle factors such as stress, sleep quality, and diet. The book reveals that depression and anxiety are correlated with shorter telomeres, and individuals with pessimistic attitudes tend to experience accelerated progression of aging-related illnesses.

Given these compelling findings, it becomes evident that attitude plays a vital role in maintaining a youthful appearance. However, promoting a positive outlook is just the first step in this journey. The second step involves investing in a quality pillowcase that aligns with your newfound mantra. By embracing a glass-half-full mentality and practicing affirmation techniques, one can unlock their inner glow and radiate a youthful aura.

In conclusion, Jennifer Lopez's commitment to positive affirmations and her embellished pillows may seem eccentric at first glance, but scientific evidence supports the notion that cultivating a positive mindset can indeed contribute to a more youthful and vibrant appearance. The lesson here is clear: by adopting a positive attitude and investing in self-affirmation practices, we can enhance our inner radiance and embrace the potential for timeless beauty.",rewrite_generation

She has expressed that she sees it as a period of growth and believes that relationships can evolve into something better for all parties involved. However, recent developments indicate that the situation is not as harmonious as initially perceived. According to a source, Channing and Jenna have been unable to reach agreements during their divorce mediation sessions, leading to contentious meetings. One significant point of contention is the custody of their five-year-old daughter, Everly. A close friend has revealed that the couple is struggling to find common ground on this matter, as well as on the smaller details surrounding their separation. 

Finances also play a crucial role in their divorce proceedings. Channing, with his successful acting career that includes blockbuster hits like Magic Mike and 21 Jump Street, has amassed an estimated fortune of $60 million, making him the primary breadwinner. Jenna, although known for her own successful movie and TV career, including roles in Supergirl, is determined to secure her financial future. The couple jointly acquired valuable assets throughout their marriage, including a $6 million Beverly Hills home and expensive cars such as a Tesla and a vintage Chevrolet truck. Dividing these assets has proven to be a challenging task, with both parties eager to bring an end to the process.

Jenna never anticipated that their divorce would reach this point. The source reveals that she is dissatisfied with how things have unfolded and has moments when she places blame on Channing for not working harder to save their marriage. While she hopes to maintain a friendship with Channing, she acknowledges that it is an unlikely outcome. The source emphasizes that Jenna is determined to prioritize her own interests and expects Channing to provide a fair financial settlement. She will not quietly walk away from the situation.

Please don’t worry about my sister who has a career & her s–t together at","In January 2016, a notable series of feuds involving the Kardashian-Jenner-West-Rose-Chyna families emerged, captivating the public's attention. These longstanding conflicts among Kanye West, Wiz Khalifa, Rob Kardashian, and Blac Chyna require a thorough understanding of their complex backstory. To ensure you are well-informed, Us Weekly has meticulously compiled a comprehensive timeline of events. 

Kanye West and Amber Rose formed a romantic relationship back in 2008 after West noticed her in Ludacris' music video for ""What Them Girls Like."" Their public romance lasted for two years until Rose decided to call it off in mid-2010. Speaking about their split on The Wendy Williams Show, Rose mentioned that West had expressed remorse over his behavior towards her.

Meanwhile, Tyga, an up-and-coming rapper, and model Blac Chyna welcomed their son King Cairo Stevenson in October 2012. Tyga shared his joy on Twitter, describing it as an incredible feeling. The couple confirmed their engagement later that year through an Instagram post featuring Chyna's impressive diamond ring.

In early 2012, shortly after his breakup with Rose, West began dating his longtime crush and friend, Kim Kardashian. Their relationship became a topic of public interest, with Kardashian's family eagerly seeking details about their romance. 

As West's romance with Kardashian blossomed, so did Rose's relationship with her new fiancé, Wiz Khalifa. In April 2012, West released the song ""Cold,"" wherein he confessed his love for Kardashian and his respect for Khalifa. 

Rose and Khalifa welcomed their first child, Sebastian, in February 2013 and secretly tied the knot in July that same year. The following month, they had a more elaborate ceremony, with Rose stunning everyone in a Pnina Tornai for Kleinfeld gown.

In June 2013, Kim Kardashian gave birth to their daughter, North West, following a complicated pregnancy. West dedicated the song ""Only One"" to his newborn daughter. 

Blac Chyna began appearing in Kim Kardashian's Instagram photos in 2014. As Kim strived to regain her pre-baby figure before her wedding to West, she posted gym selfies alongside Chyna. 

The high-profile couple tied the knot in May 2014 after gracing the cover of Vogue and celebrating with a luxurious European wedding weekend.

Things took an awkward turn when Rob Kardashian, Kim's younger brother, left her wedding festivities early. His behavior had become erratic, as he withdrew from the family's reality television show, gained significant weight, and battled depression. Rob has remained out of the public eye since then.

In August 2014, Blac Chyna and Tyga ended their relationship, aiming to keep things amicable due to their shared friendships with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian.

Rose, despite her previous intentions to spend her life with Khalifa, filed for divorce in September 2014, just 14 months after their marriage. She expressed her heartbreak on Twitter, revealing the pain she was experiencing.

During the fall of 2014, Tyga and Kylie Jenner, the youngest of the Kardashian-Jenner family, sparked dating rumors when they were frequently seen together. Although they never publicly acknowledged their romance due to Jenner's underage status at the time, the couple became the subject of speculation.

Following her split from Khalifa, Rose formed a close bond with Chyna, who had become estranged from Kim Kardashian due to the Tyga and Kylie dating rumors. Rose made her opinions known on The Breakfast Club radio show in February 2015, condemning Tyga's involvement with the much younger Jenner. 

Not one to stand by, Khloé Kardashian defended her sister on Twitter, engaging in a feud with Amber Rose. The exchange on social media highlighted the tension between Rose and the Kardashian-Jenner family.",rewrite_generation

Photo credit: BACKGRID","Ben Affleck is currently facing a crisis involving potential brain damage as a result of a recent motorcycle accident, as reported by RadarOnline.com. Friends of the 45-year-old actor express immense concern that he has pushed himself to dangerous limits following the end of his marriage to Jen Garner. Photos of the disturbing crash scene have been exclusively obtained by Radar, showcasing the severity of the incident. A peculiar twist of fate occurred when Affleck wrecked his new high-powered motorcycle, touted as the fastest in the world, on his way to church. The crash led to him hitting his head against a curb, although he managed to limp away from the accident. However, friends and medical experts fear that there may be long-term effects resulting from this collision. According to an unnamed source, Affleck's head absorbed most of the impact even though he was wearing a helmet. The true extent of the potential damage is unknown, but doctors believe that serious injuries could have occurred to his skull. Subdural hematoma, characterized by blood pooling and exerting pressure on the brain, is one possible consequence of such blunt force trauma. If untreated, this condition can lead to permanent brain damage or even death. Medical experts caution that the effects of the fall may not become apparent until they reach a life-threatening stage, making immediate attention crucial. Dr. Stuart Fischer, who has not treated Affleck, recommends thorough medical examinations such as X-rays or CT scans within 24 hours of head or neck trauma. Affleck's crash is not surprising to friends, who claim that he constantly embraces a high-octane lifestyle. His decades-long struggle with alcoholism, which led to his first rehab stint in 2001, has become well-known.

gossipcop-9639077061,"Ivanka Trump is becoming one of the most powerful first children in American History – despite not having an official job in the Trump administration. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Ivanka Trump’s products weren’t always the hottest items online. In January, for instance, the first daughter’s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes. That changed dramatically the following month. Sales of Trump’s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst’s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before. Yes, Feb. 9 — the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump’s clothing and jewelry line on “Fox & Friends.” “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would tell you,” Conway said. “I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.” And viewers did, apparently. Sales of Ivanka Trump’s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst) Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that “the beginning of February” shows “the best performing weeks in the history of the brand.” “For several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,” Klem said. Sarah Tanner, Lyst’s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton’s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter’s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company. Conway has come under fire for touting Ivanka Trump's clothing line during a televised interview. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) [A Trump wine boycott backfires spectacularly] But the brand was “largely featured” in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump’s brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had “been treated so unfairly” by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales. “It would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,” Tanner said of Conway’s Fox interview. “I think that’s one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.” Conway did not respond to an email requesting comment. Her promotion of the fashion line appeared to violate an ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products and immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans.

Bar — partly because of her on-air endorsement of Trump’s products. According to Lyst, February drew unusually large numbers of orders across many Ivanka Trump-branded products, including dresses, shoes, pants, coats, knitwear and tops. Heels were the bestsellers, followed by dresses. “We’ve never seen such a large uptick,” Tanner said. “Typically, she’s not in our top 100 sellers.” Comparing February’s numbers with last year’s average number of orders of Ivanka Trump products shows a difference of 557 percent. (Tanner said company policy prohibits her from sharing the actual numbers of online sales.) The excitement of the brand, however, may be slumping. The company’s numbers show sales were gradually tapering off toward the end of February. March does not appear to be as remarkable, but sales are still on track to be about 8 percent better than they were in January, according to Lyst.

Some retailers have partially or completely distanced themselves from the Trump brand. Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and Belk have stopped selling Trump’s branded line of clothing, shoes and jewelry. T.J.

Sears Holdings and subsidiary Kmart discontinued online sales of 31 items from the Trump Home collection last month, though their websites still contain items sold by third-party sellers.","Ivanka Trump, despite not holding an official position in the Trump administration, is emerging as one of the most influential first children in American history. According to Forbes, her fashion line, initially not performing well, experienced a drastic change in February. Sales of Ivanka Trump's products on Lyst, the world's leading fashion e-commerce website, skyrocketed and made her the 11th most popular brand. The sales spike occurred on February 9th, the same day when White House counselor Kellyanne Conway openly endorsed Trump's clothing and jewelry line on ""Fox & Friends."" Apparently, viewers responded to Conway's endorsement, as sales soared by 219 percent from the previous day. Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, stated that the beginning of February was the best performing period in the brand's history, with some categories even achieving the best performance ever. Sales of Ivanka Trump's products tend to be influenced by current events, similar to how interest in pantsuits surged by 460 percent due to Hillary Clinton's preference for that style. When Donald Trump won the presidential election in November, sales of Ivanka Trump's products rose by 86 percent. Thus, it is plausible that Conway's endorsement played a significant role in the increase of sales for Ivanka Trump's brand. Lyst spokesperson Sarah Tanner acknowledged that the brand received significant media coverage in February. Conway's endorsement occurred after President Trump expressed dissatisfaction on Twitter about Nordstrom, a department store that dropped his daughter's clothing line due to sluggish sales. It is reasonable to assume that Conway's interview contributed to the surge in sales by generating substantial media attention for the brand. Both Democrats and Republicans criticized Conway's actions, as it seemed to violate an ethics rule forbidding federal employees from endorsing products while holding public office. Representative Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, stated that Conway had crossed the line and should be reprimanded. Although the White House insisted that Conway received counseling, concerns regarding her comments remain. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, criticized the White House for not taking disciplinary action against Conway. In a letter to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues, Shaub emphasized the importance of disciplinary action to deter future misconduct and ensure the integrity of the ethics program. Last month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway, highlighting her on-air endorsement of Trump's products as one of the reasons. Lyst reported unusually high numbers of orders for a wide range of Ivanka Trump-branded products in February, including dresses, shoes, pants, coats, knitwear, and tops. Heels were particularly popular, followed by dresses. Such a sharp increase in sales was unprecedented, as Ivanka Trump's products typically do not rank among the top 100 sellers on Lyst. Comparing February's sales with the average number of orders from last year revealed a remarkable difference of 557 percent. Although the excitement around the brand seemed to be declining toward the end of February, Lyst projected that sales in March would still exceed those of January by approximately 8 percent. Despite an aggressive boycott campaign called ""Grab Your Wallet,"" initiated in October 2016, the Ivanka Trump brand appears to have survived. The campaign encouraged shoppers to avoid retailers that carried Trump-branded products. Nevertheless, some retailers, such as Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, and Belk, ceased selling Trump's line entirely or partially distanced themselves from it. T.J. Maxx and Marshalls instructed employees not to promote Trump products in their stores and relocated Trump clothing to general merchandise racks. Sears Holdings and subsidiary Kmart stopped online sales of 31 items from the Trump Home collection, but third-party sellers still offer Trump-branded products on their websites.",rewrite_generation

Instagram Selena performs ""The Heart Wants What It Wants"" at the American Music","In the fall of 2017, news emerged that Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez were spending time together again. Following their church and brunch outing, it was reported that Selena had ended her 10-month relationship with The Weeknd. Subsequently, Justin and Selena were seen riding bikes together, and then came the hockey jersey and a series of kissing photos. In March 2018, rumors of a breakup between Jelena started circulating. As fans contemplate the future of this love story, let's take a reflective look at the journey of Jelena thus far. The book of Jelena began in December 2010 when Justin and Selena were seen holding hands in Philadelphia. This moment marked the start of an impactful chapter in their lives. Throughout the years, they faced numerous breakup speculations, with one notable incident in November 2011 when Justin was involved in a paternity suit that was eventually dropped. In May 2012, Selena posted a photo on social media from a shooting range before deleting her Instagram account. Despite occasional breakup rumors, Jelena appeared together at the premiere of Katy Perry: Part of Me in June 2012. October 2012 brought a cryptic photo from Justin, fueling speculation of a single status. Reports in November 2012 indicated a breakup between Justin and Selena due to their busy schedules. During this time, Justin was briefly related to Victoria's Secret model Barbara Palvin and later Miranda Kerr, but Barbara clarified on Twitter that they were merely friends. Immediately after kissing in an airport in Salt Lake City, Jelena's relationship reportedly ended in December 2012 during their New Year's Eve vacation in Mexico. Selena tweeted about new beginnings and a fresh start. In January 2013, Selena indirectly mentioned Justin by sporting a hat representing his hometown hockey team. March 2013 saw Selena suggesting a lack of heartbreak during an interview, while in April, she reportedly flew to Norway to visit Justin. However, the photo he shared on Instagram in response was promptly deleted. In May 2013, Selena greeted Justin with a kiss on the cheek at the Billboard Music Awards, which drew a reaction from Taylor Swift. Although they spent Fourth of July together, Selena claimed to be ""single"" in a subsequent interview. Justin kicked off January 2014 with an affectionate photo of Selena hugging him, expressing his love for her. In March, they appeared in videos where they could be seen dancing, although these were soon removed. Justin also shared photos of Selena from the Vanity Fair Oscar party, lavishing her with admiration. During April 2014, rumors circulated about a fight between Justin and Selena at Coachella, sparked by photos of Kylie Jenner found on Justin's phone. Selena was later linked to Orlando Bloom. In June, Justin posted and deleted another black and white photo with Selena, highlighting their unconditional love. They were subsequently seen together at various events, reinforcing the notion of a rekindled romance. At the same time, Justin faced criticism for a racist joke shown on video, with reports suggesting that Selena stood by him during this controversy. July 2014 brought an altercation between Justin and Orlando in Ibiza, evidenced by a widely circulated video. This incident was accompanied by Justin posting and deleting a provocative photo of Miranda Kerr on Instagram. In August, Justin shared a photo of himself with Selena, hinting at a renewed connection.

Exiting #ParisAgreement imperils US security and our ability","In response to President Donald Trump's announcement of the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, Hollywood figures swiftly expressed their concerns. Former Vice President Al Gore labeled the decision ""reckless and indefensible,"" emphasizing how it compromises America's global standing and endangers our ability to address the urgent climate crisis. Gore stated that if the President fails to lead, the American people will step up. The Weather Channel even updated its homepage to address the potential consequences of this announcement.

Leonardo DiCaprio, who previously urged world leaders to join the Paris Agreement, voiced his disappointment on Twitter and called for collective action. Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, announced his resignation from Trump's advisory councils, citing the damaging effects that leaving the Paris accord will have on America and the world.

Actor Kal Penn, who served in the White House Office of Public Engagement during the Obama administration, encouraged activism, urging individuals to take action and not just be angered by the situation. Jon Favreau, Obama's former chief speechwriter, highlighted potential motives behind President Trump's decision, drawing attention to commentator Ann Coulter's remark that it was primarily to provoke opposition.

Renowned director Ava DuVernay expressed her disapproval with a concise but powerful word: ""Shameful."" Bette Midler criticized the press for their role in electing what she deemed a destructive President. Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson took a broader swipe at the entirety of Trump's administration, suggesting that their lack of understanding of science may be a factor in this ill-advised move.

Filmmaker and activist Michael Moore unleashed a string of messages highlighting the severity of Trump's decision and referred to it as a crime against humanity. Jeff Immelt, CEO of General Electric, stressed that climate change is a genuine concern and emphasized the need for industry to lead in the absence of governmental support.

Molly McNearney, wife of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, discredited climate change deniers by drawing a parallel between their denial and previous misconceptions about harmful substances, such as tobacco.

These are just some of the reactions to the President's decision, reflecting the deep concern and disappointment among various industry figures. Their sentiments demonstrate the impact and importance of the Paris climate accord, beyond just environmental considerations, and how this withdrawal places America and the world in jeopardy.",rewrite_generation

The couple has made attempts at couples therapy, but unfortunately, it has not proven successful and has inadvertently exacerbated their conflicts.

But Trump has insisted that's how he wants it, saying the swearing-in festivities should be about the people, not the A-list stars.","Broadway star Jennifer Holliday has made the decision to withdraw as a performer at the upcoming presidential inaugural. In a statement released on Saturday, Holliday expressed regret for her lack of understanding regarding the implications of her participation, which was interpreted as a show of support for President-elect Donald Trump. The announcement comes after the acclaimed actress faced pressure from her gay, lesbian, and black fan base upon the announcement of her involvement in the Lincoln Memorial concert scheduled for Thursday in Washington. It should be noted that several notable entertainers have also declined to perform at the Trump inaugural festivities, while some, such as country star Toby Keith and actor Jon Voigt, remain in the lineup for the concert. Holliday's reversal was initially reported by The Wrap, which obtained a letter she wrote addressed to her fans. Her representative later confirmed the authenticity of the letter to The Associated Press. In the heartfelt letter, Holliday pledged her support to the LGBT community and firmly stated her decision not to perform at any of the inauguration festivities. She expressed her deep gratitude and indebtedness to her fans, particularly from the LGBT community, who showed unwavering support throughout her career. Though the controversy has garnered attention, it is worth noting that Trump's inaugural festivities lack the celebrity attendance seen at former President Barack Obama's inaugurations, where A-list stars such as Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen, and U2 performed. Trump, however, has emphasized that the focus of the swearing-in celebrations should be on the people rather than the presence of high-profile entertainers.",rewrite_generation
gossipcop-2194660040,"First Lady Melania Trump claims there is a secret poisoner in the White House and fears her husband is being slowly poisoned with “heavy sedatives” smuggled into his drinks in an attempt to slow him down, control him, and discredit his presidency, according to reports.  While public debate rages about Donald Trump’s health, Melania has told friends and associates that the once robust and high energy man she knew and loved has been replaced with a “slower, damaged version”.  “By 8pm he is slurring,” she said. “This is not the man I know.”  Fearing that the sedatives are being pumped into the body of the POTUS via Coca-Cola that he orders by pressing a button he had installed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Melania has insisted he stop drinking from the tap and instead revert to drinking from cans she brings herself.  “Donald’s heath improved out of sight when he stopped drinking from the tap,” Melania said.  However the First Lady fears the active campaign to poison the president is “a high level operation” and “not the work of a solitary loon.”  Melania is popular in the White House—as she is with the rest of the country—and she has befriended senior intelligence agency staff who remain loyal to president. They have educated her about Ronald Regan’s poisoning by the Deep State after his assassination attempt in 1981. They have also warned her that George W. Bush was reduced to a “brain damaged” state after years of steady poisoning.  But the advantage Trump may hold over his GOP predecessors in the Oval Office is that he has a wife who is wise to the ruse and is insisting he watch his food and drink intake closely for signs of adulteration.  Donald Trump’s food choices say a lot about the man. The president’s Howard Hughes-level pickiness when it comes to food is partly motivated by a desire to avoid being poisoned, according to Melania. He doesn’t trust those around him – and rightfully so.  As President Trump knows all too well, there are enemies of the state dug in deep at the White House.  Reporters from TIME recently got a glimpse behind-the-scenes at the White House, where they reported on what goes down at the president’s dinner table. Of particular interest was a meal enjoyed by the reporters, Trump, and Vice President Pence.  Pence’s meal was not unusual—he ate what everyone else did.

But the POTUS received a meal fully customized to his own preferences, and closely observed by Melania who insisted on watching the chef prepare the meal with ingredients she provided herself.","According to reports, First Lady Melania Trump has recently expressed concerns about a potential poisoning threat in the White House. Melania believes that her husband, President Donald Trump, may be slowly poisoned with sedatives that are smuggled into his drinks. Worried about his declining health, Melania has confided in friends and associates that the once energetic President she knew and loved has become a slower and damaged version of himself. She noted that by 8pm, he often experiences slurring speech, which deeply worries her.

In an attempt to safeguard the President's well-being, Melania suspects that the sedatives are being added to President Trump's favorite Coca-Cola drinks, which are conveniently delivered to him via a button he had installed on his desk. In an effort to prevent any possible tampering, Melania has urged him to stop drinking directly from the tap and instead opt for cans that she personally provides. Surprisingly, this change in drinking habits has resulted in a noticeable improvement in the President's health, according to Melania.

However, the First Lady believes that the campaign to poison her husband is not the work of a solitary individual, but rather a sophisticated operation conducted by a group or organization of high prominence. Melania, who is well-liked in the White House and has established friendships with senior intelligence agency staff loyal to her husband, has been educated on previous instances of poisoning in the political sphere. She was informed about the poisoning attempt of Ronald Reagan after his assassination attempt in 1981, as well as the alleged gradual poisoning of George W. Bush, which led to his diminished cognitive abilities.

Unlike his predecessors, President Trump may have an advantage in the form of Melania, who is keenly aware of the potential dangers and insists that he closely monitors his food and drink intake for any signs of adulteration. Melania has revealed that her husband's discerning food choices stem from a deep-rooted concern about being poisoned, as he holds a level of mistrust toward those around him—a sentiment that Melania believes is justified. She is fully aware that the White House harbors individuals who pose as enemies to the security and wellbeing of the state.

Recently, TIME magazine managed to gain insight into the President's dining experiences at the White House. During a particular meal attended by reporters, President Trump and Vice President Pence, it was observed that while Pence's meal was ordinary, Trump's was fully customized to his specific preferences. Melania closely watched the chef prepare the President's meal using ingredients that she personally provided, ensuring utmost vigilance against any potential threats.

Melania's unwavering commitment to President Trump's safety and well-being demonstrates her dedication as a First Lady. Her understanding of the risks and her proactive approach in protecting her husband from any potential harm is a testament to her astuteness and concern for his welfare.",rewrite_generation

Recent events have sparked controversy surrounding the country singer, as he sent out a cryptic tweet referencing karma just as news broke that his ex-wife Miranda Lambert was allegedly involved with a married man. In his tweet, Shelton proclaimed his adherence to the high road for a significant period of time, yet expressed a newfound belief in the workings of karma. This statement was made after multiple outlets reported that Lambert had begun dating Evan Felker, the married frontman of Turnpike Troubadours.

However, Lambert's ex-boyfriend Jeff Allen has shed light on Shelton's past, asserting that the singer is not as blameless as he may want to appear. Allen recently tweeted, but later deleted, a post calling out Shelton for engaging in a romantic relationship with Lambert while Shelton himself was still married to his first wife, Kaynette Williams, back in 2006. Allen's tweet revealed his discontent with Shelton's audacity in invoking karma, stating, ""You know, I’ve always given you the benefit of the doubt and chalked it up to just being human, but you must be one arrogant SOB to pop off something like this when I know damn good and well you were cheating on your wife and Miranda was cheating on me when you two started up."" Despite holding his silence for over a decade, Allen felt compelled to share his frustrations, asserting that the notion of karma held no relevance for Shelton's actions towards him.

Allen's comments serve to shed light on the complexities of the situation, but he also acknowledged that his feelings towards Lambert remain positive. He described her as a loving, caring person and a good girlfriend, indicating his lack of animosity towards her in light of their past. Representatives for both Lambert and Shelton did not provide any comment in response to Fox News' inquiries.

Reports have surfaced regarding the origin of Lambert and Shelton's relationship, with allegations of it beginning as an affair. However, both singers have consistently denied these claims in the past. Their romantic journey commenced with an engagement in May 2010, followed by their wedding in Texas the following year. Unfortunately, after four years of marriage, the two musicians announced their divorce in July 2015.

Recent developments indicate that Lambert, who recently ended her two-year relationship with Anderson East, began a romantic involvement with Felker when his band joined her ""Livin’ Like Hippies"" tour in January. It is worth noting that Felker was married to global strategist Staci Nelson in September 2016. However, it appears their relationship has reached a pivotal juncture, as Felker filed for divorce on February 16th, followed by Nelson's filing 12 days later. Nelson, who continues to use her married name on social media, recently shared a tearful selfie along with a caption that reads, ""PSA: If Staci Felker can make it through this week, so can you.""

In conclusion, the ongoing saga involving Blake Shelton, Miranda Lambert, and Evan Felker continues to captivate audiences and raise questions about the concept of karma. While Shelton's recent tweet displays his belief in the workings of karma, Jeff Allen's tweet highlights the complexities of their intertwined past. Despite the lack of comment from Lambert and Shelton's representatives, the couple's previous denial of an affair adds another layer of intrigue to their history. Ultimately, it remains unclear how these relationships will unfold, as recent divorce filings and emotional social media posts further entangle this narrative.",rewrite_generation

According to exclusive information obtained by In Touch, Shelton decided to end the relationship before embarking on his tour in February, leaving Stefani feeling heartbroken and confused. Despite a recent photo posted by Stefani featuring Shelton on social media, it appears to be an attempt to ignore the truth of their separation. Another insider reveals that while Stefani continues to show her support for Shelton online, he has significantly reduced communication with her. This lack of reciprocation has left Stefani even more distraught.

The source explains that Shelton's decision to end the relationship stems from his frustration with Stefani's neediness, as well as the ongoing drama involving her ex-husband and her jealousy towards other women. In particular, Stefani's jealousy over Shelton's friendship with The Voice winner, Chloe Kohanski, became a breaking point in their relationship. Stefani expressed her concerns about living in constant fear of Shelton's potential infidelity, which ultimately led to his decision to continue his month-long Country Freaks Tour without her.

The breakup took an emotional toll on Stefani, as she was accustomed to accompanying Shelton on tour. After a heated argument, Shelton left without even saying goodbye, further intensifying the pain and upheaval in their relationship. Adding to Stefani's distress, it has been discovered that Shelton has sought solace in his newly-single ex-wife, Miranda Lambert. According to an insider, Lambert reached out to Shelton and they have since formed a close friendship, providing support and sharing intimate details of their lives. The news of Shelton and Lambert's newfound closeness surely adds another layer of complexity to Stefani's already heart-wrenching situation.

In conclusion, the end of Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani's relationship has left Stefani devastated and struggling to come to terms with the breakup. Shelton's decision was influenced by Stefani's insecurities and their ongoing disputes over trust. The abrupt departure and subsequent emotional support sought by Shelton from his ex-wife serve to further compound Stefani's emotional turmoil. It remains to be seen how she will cope with this unexpected turn of events.",rewrite_generation

In an effort to document her recovery process, the renowned actress shared a video on her Instagram Story where she can be seen applying ice to her healing shoulder. In a rather lighthearted manner, Cuoco mentions that it's the third consecutive day she's worn the same shirt, while a bag of ice cubes rests comfortably on her shoulder. She even teases her husband Karl about the need to redo her hairstyles, stating that it could be the inspiration for a sitcom. In addition to the video, Cuoco emphasizes the significance of ice in her healing journey, describing it as her ""best friend"" at the moment.

In another video, Cuoco amusingly shares how her dog Ruby is benefiting from her forced downtime while she recovers from the procedure. She jests that Ruby is quite content with her constant presence, allowing her to lay and stare at Cuoco for hours on end. Cuoco jokingly inquires if this is Ruby's ultimate dream come true.

Contrary to popular belief, Cuoco clarifies that the surgery was not the result of a spontaneous injury. Rather, it was a premeditated decision she made over a year ago. She explains through her Instagram Story that she had injured her shoulder more than a year ago, and though immediate surgery was not required, she cunningly planned it to coincide with her wedding. Cuoco humorously adds that she knew she would have a ""babysitter"" in the form of her newlywed husband, Karl Cook.

Taking into account the length of the recovery process, which could extend up to six weeks, Cuoco mentions her intentions to keep a low profile during this period. Playfully panning the camera towards Cook, she exclaims that she is now confined to a sizable cast, and temporarily unable to engage in horse-related activities. Cuoco adds a jestful remark, hoping that they both survive the recovery process unscathed.

Cuoco initially unveiled news of her surgery on Thursday, alongside a selfie taken at the hospital. Expressing her gratitude for the support and love she has received, she anticipates that her husband, Cook, will provide entertaining updates throughout her recovery. True to her expectations, Cook promptly posts a photo of Cuoco during her hospital stay, humorously referring to her ""shoulder surgery honeymoon"" and emphasizing her unique post-operation glow.

Earlier that month, Ouzounian tipped off the paparazzi, telling them she'd be at the L.A.-area rental house that Affleck was staying in at the time, a source later told ET. The former nanny was seen smiling wide as she handed Affleck a bottle of champagne during their late-night meetup. She also arrived at Affleck's in his Lexus, which she had also been seen driving earlier in the day while running errands.

Just one month earlier, Affleck thanked Garner for her support after announcing that he had just completed treatment for alcohol addiction. ""I'm lucky to have the love of my family and friends, including my co-parent, Jen, who has supported me and cared for our kids as I've done the work I set out to do,"" he wrote in his statement on Facebook.

""They live separately but","Some reports suggest that Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus began their relationship while they were still married to their respective spouses. According to a source, Affleck first encountered Shookus when he was still married to Jennifer Garner and Shookus was married to Kevin Miller, a fellow producer on Saturday Night Live. The source reveals that Affleck and Shookus were seeing each other as early as late 2014, several months before news of Affleck's alleged fling with his children's nanny, Christine Ouzounian, broke in the summer of 2015. However, a source close to Affleck disputes these claims, asserting that the actor and Shookus did not become romantically involved until after his separation from Garner in 2015. It is important to note that both Affleck and Shookus were married at the time, but our sources suggest that they were discreet about their relationship and took precautions to keep it hidden. 

A timeline of their alleged relationship reveals that Affleck and Shookus reportedly started seeing each other in 2013, two years prior to Affleck and Garner's separation. One month after Affleck's monologue on a Saturday Night Live episode in May 2013, eyewitnesses apparently observed Affleck and Shookus looking flirty at The Heat premiere after-party in New York City. Over the years, their relationship supposedly continued, but it was not until 2015 that they became involved romantically, according to a source close to Affleck. This source claims that Affleck and Shookus had an affair, frequently meeting up in New York City and other locations. 

In 2015, Garner and Miller reportedly discovered Affleck and Shookus' alleged relationship at the same time. However, a source close to Affleck asserts that Shookus was not the cause of their marriage's end, claiming that they faced numerous other problems. Affleck and Garner officially announced their separation on June 30, 2015, emphasizing their commitment to co-parenting their children and requesting privacy. 

The nanny scandal involving Affleck and Ouzounian emerged in July 2015. Us Weekly reported that Affleck and Ouzounian were secretly dating, with frequent texting and emailing occurring even after Ouzounian was no longer employed as the children's nanny. Affleck's representative denied these allegations, calling them baseless and untrue.

gossipcop-7885025406,"More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor’s shocking dismissal.  “The whole thing has been very painful for me,” Couric, 61, tells PEOPLE. “The accounts I’ve read and heard have been disturbing, distressing and disorienting and it’s completely unacceptable that any woman at the Today show experienced this kind of treatment.  “I had no idea this was going on during my tenure or after I left,” she continued. “I think I speak for many of my former colleagues when I say this was not the Matt we knew. Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It’s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.”  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer “pinches me on the ass a lot.” A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer’s firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC’s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer’s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.  In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, “It’s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I’m ready to.

The movement inspired the new Time’s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time’s Up was a major focus at this year’s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  “I think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,” Couric tells PEOPLE about Time’s Up. “Clearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.”  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  “One of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,” she says. “I just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this.

Couric, 61, expresses her distress over the distressing and disorienting accounts she has come across regarding Lauer's actions towards women at the Today show, stating it is completely unacceptable. During her tenure and even after her departure, Couric claims to have had no knowledge of such behavior. She emphasizes that the Matt she knew was a kind and respectful colleague, contrary to the troubling allegations. Despite the turmoil, Couric admires the way Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb, and the entire Today show staff have handled this difficult situation. 

The late-night show joke Couric refers to occurred in 2012 on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, where she jokingly mentioned that Lauer would frequently pinch her on the backside. This comment resurfaced online following Lauer's firing. 

Having co-hosted NBC's Today show with Lauer for 15 years, Couric left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News. 

In November, Lauer was fired by NBC News due to a ""detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,"" with indications that this may not have been an isolated incident. Anonymous reports in Variety and The New York Times have also accused him of sexual harassment and assault. Lauer addressed the initial allegations in a statement, expressing deep sorrow and regret for the pain he has caused others. 

While this PEOPLE interview marks the first time Couric delves into the details surrounding Lauer's departure, she briefly acknowledged the scandal on social media in December, mentioning that it is incredibly upsetting and hinting that she will speak out when ready. 

The accusations against Lauer emerged alongside numerous others against powerful individuals in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey. This prompted the creation of the Time's Up initiative and legal defense fund, which aims to support victims of sexual misconduct in pursuing legal action against their perpetrators. The movement was prominent at this year's Golden Globes, where attendees wore black to raise awareness. Couric expresses her admiration for the solidarity amongst women and the demand for change in various industries, seeing it as a long overdue course correction. 

Furthermore, Couric shares that an episode in her upcoming Nat Geo documentary series will focus on workplace harassment experienced by women in Hollywood, Silicon Valley, and other sectors. She had recently interviewed Elisabeth Moss on the subject, highlighting that harassment represents just one facet of the challenges women face.",rewrite_generation

LA County Superior Court advised the couple that their divorce case may be delayed because they have yet to file and enter the final judgment, a document obtained by The Blast revealed.  “If you fail to take the appropriate steps in your case, the court may dismiss your case for delay in prosecution,” the document states.  It’s unclear what the holdup is.  Garner, 46, and Affleck, 45, were married for nearly 10 years before separating in 2015. Last year, following reports that Garner had called off their divorce, Affleck finally moved out of the property the couple shared.  Shortly after, it was revealed that Affleck had moved on with “Saturday Night Live” producer Lindsay Shookus in July 2017.  The exes have an amicable relationship and are focused on co-parenting their daughters, Violet, 12, and Seraphina, 9, and son Samuel, 6.  “We are definitely a modern family.

LA County Superior Court advised the couple that their divorce case may be delayed because they have yet to file and enter the final judgment, a document obtained by The Blast revealed.  “If you fail to take the appropriate steps in your case, the court may dismiss your case for delay in prosecution,” the document states.  It’s unclear what the holdup is.  Garner, 46, and Affleck, 45, were married for nearly 10 years before separating in 2015. Last year, following reports that Garner had called off their divorce, Affleck finally moved out of the property the couple shared.  Shortly after, it was revealed that Affleck had moved on with “Saturday Night Live” producer Lindsay Shookus in July 2017.  The exes have an amicable relationship and are focused on co-parenting their daughters, Violet, 12, and Seraphina, 9, and son Samuel, 6.  “We are definitely a modern family.

Garner, aged 46, and Affleck, aged 45, ended their almost ten-year marriage in 2015. Reports of Garner revoking the divorce emerged last year, leading to Affleck eventually moving out of their shared property.

Despite the divorce, both parties maintain an amicable relationship and prioritize co-parenting their three children, Violet (12), Seraphina (9), and Samuel (6).

[We’ve had] a bit of FaceTime to ease it in you know.”","Gwen Stefani dismisses rumors of her breakup with Blake Shelton in a recent Instagram post. The photo captures a tender moment between the couple, reaffirming the status of their relationship. Speculations about the breakup were fueled by claims of jealousy and drama surrounding Gwen's ex-husband, Gavin Rossdale. According to a source from In Touch Weekly, Gwen's alleged neediness and her fear of infidelity from her famous partner became a breaking point in their relationship. Blake apparently decided to continue his country tour without Gwen after a contentious argument, leaving her feeling upended. Mirror Online has reached out to Gwen's representative for any comments. Gavin recently revealed in an interview on Loose Women that he and Gwen had undergone extensive counseling in an attempt to salvage their marriage. However, after 13 years together, they finalized their divorce in 2016.

McEnroe suggested that if Williams were to compete against male players, she would struggle to place higher than 700th in the world rankings. However, Dmitry Tursunov, the current male player ranked 701st, expressed confidence in his ability to defeat her. In an interview with US radio station NPR, McEnroe clarified his remarks, emphasizing his respect and admiration for Williams while acknowledging the possibility of exceptional female talent surpassing their male counterparts in the future. Yet, he maintained that based on his observations across various sports, including tennis, he has not witnessed such a phenomenon. Williams later responded to McEnroe's comments on Twitter, politely requesting that he refrain from sharing unfounded opinions about her abilities and respect her privacy, particularly as she is currently focusing on starting a family. At the age of 35, Williams secured her 23rd Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January, unknowingly while pregnant. Tursunov, a former top 20 male player, remarked that he did not believe McEnroe intended to belittle women's tennis, but rather highlighted the physical advantage men generally possess. He expressed his belief that he could win against Williams in a hypothetical match, drawing a parallel to the debate over who would run faster, the fastest woman or the fastest man. Tursunov acknowledged that factors beyond physicality influence match outcomes and noted that despite his lower ranking, he considers himself a formidable opponent. Reflecting on the history of gender-based tennis matches, the famous ""Battle of the Sexes"" between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs in 1973 stands out. Riggs, a retired former world number one, believed he could defeat any top female player at the age of 55. Initially, King declined his challenge, leading Margaret Court, the number one female player, to step in, only to lose to Riggs. However, King later faced Riggs in an exhibition match and emerged victorious. Another notable match occurred in 1992 between tennis greats Jimmy Connors and Martina Navratilova, where Connors prevailed following adjusted rules to level the playing field.",rewrite_generation

Brothers, James Stanford Poore, 32, and Cedric Dwayne Poore, 39, were arrested and booked on four complaints each of first degree murder, Chief Chuck Jordan said.  On Monday, January 7, 2013, twin sisters Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Powell-Melchor, 23; Misty Nunley, 33, and Julie Jackson, 55 were found shot in the head, with their hands tied behind their backs inside a south Tulsa apartment, police say. A 3-year-old boy was also found inside the apartment, unharmed.  Chief Jordan said the murders were not gang-related. According to arrest reports, witnesses told investigators that the brothers left an apartment in the same building at Fairmont Terrace Apartments, near 61st and Peoria, saying they were going to pull a ""lick"" at the victims' apartment.  Witnesses told police the brothers returned about 20 minutes later with a bag full of drugs, cash, and jewelry. According to the report, James Poore told the witnesses that he shot one of the victims because she could identify him and that Cedric shot the other three. The witnesses told investigators the brothers split the money and that Cedric Poore took the jewelry to pawn.    When he was interviewed Wednesday, James Poore confirmed to investigators that he knew one of the victims and that he was in the apartment where the witnesses placed him. Before invoking his right to remain silent, he told investigators he knew one of the victims had used and sold illegal drugs and that Cedric drove a black van to the apartment the day of the murders.    The arrest report shows Cedric Poore denied being in the apartment the day of the murders and refused to speak to investigators any more.

Brothers James Stanford Poore, aged 32, and Cedric Dwayne Poore, aged 39, were apprehended and charged with four counts each of first-degree murder, according to Chief Chuck Jordan.

The victims, twin sisters Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Powell-Melchor (23 years old), Misty Nunley (33 years old), and Julie Jackson (55 years old), were tragically found with gunshot wounds to the head, their hands bound behind their backs inside a south Tulsa apartment. A three-year-old boy, who was also found in the apartment, was unharmed.

Chief Jordan stated that the motive behind these horrifying murders was not related to any gang activity. Information gathered from witnesses revealed that the suspects left their own apartment in the same building as Fairmont Terrace Apartments, situated near 61st and Peoria, with the intention of carrying out a criminal act at the victims' residence. Approximately 20 minutes later, the witnesses reported seeing the brothers return with a bag containing drugs, cash, and jewelry. One witness informed investigators that James Poore shared his motivation for shooting one of the victims, fearing she could recognize him, while Cedric Poore was responsible for shooting the other three victims. The witnesses further disclosed that the brothers divided the stolen money between them, with Cedric Poore pawning the stolen jewelry.

During the interview on Wednesday, James Poore admitted to investigators that he knew one of the victims and was present at the apartment complex at the time specified by the witnesses. He also provided the information that one of the victims had a history of using and selling illegal drugs, and described how Cedric had arrived at the apartment that day driving a black van. Shortly after making these statements, James Poore invoked his right to remain silent. In contrast, Cedric Poore denied being present in the apartment on the day of the murders and declined any further communication with investigators.

Chief Jordan revealed that both brothers were residents of Fairmont Terrace Apartments. However, the property manager confirmed that neither of them were on the lease agreement. Cedric Poore had been confined in Tulsa County jail since January 14 for a traffic violation, while James Poore was apprehended on Wednesday morning. Records from the Department of Corrections indicate that both brothers had been previously incarcerated for armed robbery.

Chief Jordan concluded the press conference by mentioning the possibility of additional arrests in connection with this case. Mayor Dewey Bartlett also released a statement in response to the news of the arrests, commending the Tulsa Police Department for their swift action. He expressed his unwavering faith in Chief Chuck Jordan and the entire police force, highlighting the importance of public assistance in solving such heinous crimes.",rewrite_generation

In the family's celebratory Hollywood Reporter cover story, Kendall explained to the magazine that members of the crew can't help sobbing when one of the girls opens up.  Hollywood reporter A post shared by Kendall (@kendalljenner) on Aug 16, 2017 at 8:26am PDT  She said, 'We have such a personal relationship with the crew. When one of us cries on the show usually you'll look around and the camera guy is crying and the producer is crying'  Kim added, 'It really is an intimate relationship. These people see every last thing.'  The crew can go from anything from one iPhone to a 30-strong team, all watching their every move.  THE KARDASHIAN DECADE A post shared by Kourtney Kardashian (@kourtneykardash) on Aug 16, 2017 at 6:39am PDT  Whoever was on set would have also been privy to Kendall's reaction to the politically insensitive Pepsi advert she was must-lambasted for. Though we as a public have received no evidence of how Kendall reacted to the onslaught of criticism (she has deleted all evidence of it on her social media and has never made a statement), Kim explains that Kendall would never let herself be shown on camera crying.  She told the magazine:  We're not perfect, but you see these things in the media, like Kendall and Pepsi, where I see her at home crying, but in the media she looks another way because she's not addressing it. I'm just like, 'This is wrong. You need to speak up.' She was like, 'I don't ever want to show that footage of me crying.' She was trying to not make excuses or be dramatic, but that was what she was going through at the time.  We suppose the only non-family members who know the truth are those blubbering crew members then.","Regardless of any preconceived notions about Keeping Up With The Kardashians, the long-running and popular show delves into some deeply emotional storylines. Beyond the surface-level focus on technology, healthy eating, and colloquial language, there are truly moving moments to be found.

Consider Kim's account of the terrifying ordeal she experienced in Paris, or Khloe's concerns about her fertility. The dysfunctional relationship between Scott and Courtney is also undeniably unsettling. It seems that shedding a tear for the Kardashians is not an uncommon occurrence, as revealed in their celebratory cover story with the Hollywood Reporter. Kendall explained that even the crew members can't help but be moved to tears when one of the girls opens up.

The personal connection between the family and their crew is undeniable. Kendall acknowledges the intimate relationship they share, stating that when someone cries on the show, it often prompts tears from the camera operators and producers as well. Kim reinforces this sentiment, emphasizing that these crew members witness every detail of their lives. The crew size can vary, ranging from a single person with an iPhone to a team of 30 individuals, all diligently observing their every move.

Anyone present on set during Kendall's controversial Pepsi advertisement would have also been privy to her reaction amidst the criticism she faced. While the public has not been provided with evidence of how Kendall responded to the backlash (as she deleted all related content from her social media and never made an official statement), Kim sheds some light on the situation. According to Kim, Kendall never allowed herself to be shown crying on camera. Despite the inner turmoil she experienced, Kendall made a conscious decision to appear resilient in the media. Kim, however, believed that Kendall should have spoken up, viewing the situation as unjust.

Ultimately, it appears that the only individuals who truly know the extent of Kendall's emotions during that time are the crew members who witnessed it firsthand.",rewrite_generation

One social media movement, sparked by comedian George Lopez, called for a #Brownout in protest of Trump's failure to appoint a Latino to his cabinet. This movement encourages individuals to change their avatar to a brown square, symbolizing solidarity and support for Latino representation. Chrissy Teigen, known for her criticism of Trump, drew attention for her comments on the prayer portion of the inauguration, referencing Trump's past controversial remarks. Shonda Rhimes, on the other hand, praised Hillary Clinton and highlighted a list of alternative activities to engage in during the inauguration. Singer Katy Perry announced her intentions to sleep in instead of watching the ceremony and expressed her participation in the Women's March on Washington the following day. Other celebrities, such as Patton Oswalt, Christie Brinkley, and Elizabeth Banks, also suggested alternative activities to occupy their time.

Sources close to production have revealed that Hudson received a clear message from NBC's higher-ups, requesting that she cease using The Voice as a means to plug her company.

This disorder, which commonly manifests itself during adolescence or young adulthood, results in heightened sensitivity to pain. Alongside fatigue and stiffness, individuals may also experience sleep disorders, memory problems, depression, and tenderness. 

Although the root cause of fibromyalgia remains unknown, it has been associated with stress, repetitive injuries, and other illnesses like Lupus, according to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. Researchers are actively working to identify the causes of this pain in the hopes of discovering effective treatments or even a cure. 

Treatment approaches for fibromyalgia go beyond medication, focusing on enhancing the overall quality of life through self-care and lifestyle changes. Healthline suggests a range of treatments, from antidepressants and sleep aids to pain relievers and narcolepsy drugs. Alongside Lady Gaga, other celebrities such as Morgan Freeman, Paula Abdul, George Clooney, and Tobey Maguire have also spoken candidly about their struggles with chronic pain or fibromyalgia.

In her press conference, Lady Gaga emphasized that ""pain is a microphone"" and it must be transformed into something meaningful. The release of ""Gaga: Five Foot Two"" on September 22 on Netflix aims to inspire others who are facing similar challenges to find their own ways of transforming pain.",rewrite_generation

Something Kardashian has surely done.","Absurdly Driven, a column that approaches the business world with a discerning perspective and a lighthearted touch, delves into the subject of public criticism. In today's society, no one is exempt from receiving unflattering comments, not even esteemed figures like the Pope. The impact of such remarks, however, is solely determined by one's awareness of them or, worse yet, when confronted with unpleasant comments directly. This brings us to the realm of Twitter, a platform notorious for the uncontrolled dissemination of insults. From behind the guise of anonymity, users can launch verbal attacks on anyone they choose. Predictably, some individuals choose to target easy marks such as Kim Kardashian. Celebrities like her, seemingly leading effortlessly luxurious lives with their wealth, TV shows, and branded products, become prime recipients of malicious criticism. 

Recently, a Twitter user named Kevin James took a mild shot at Kardashian's persona, evoking the notion that she exudes self-absorption even without speaking. James humorously expressed his thoughts while simultaneously confessing his fondness for the Kardashian family. 

When faced with such attacks on Twitter, users have several choices in how to respond. Reacting aggressively to trolls rarely proves worth the effort. Ignoring and blocking those who spew negativity is an option, as is relying on one's fans to come to their defense. However, there is an alternative path – one that is disarmingly gracious. Kardashian, adeptly navigating this path, responded with a self-deprecating tweet that cleverly captured the emotional essence of her interlocutor's quip. By doing so, she portrayed herself as more self-aware than self-absorbed. Additionally, her response likely earned a laugh even from Kevin James himself. Appropriately, James reciprocated her disarming approach, expressing thoughtful contrition and appreciation for Kardashian's sense of humor.

Thus, rather than succumbing to the emotional strain that public criticism can bring, Kardashian transformed the situation into a lighthearted exchange, infusing it with one of life's greatest joys: laughter. This skill of turning tense situations into pleasant ones is a coveted trait that most of us aspire to possess. On the rare occasions when we achieve this feat, it brings us immense satisfaction. In other instances, we often reflect on encounters and wish we had responded differently. This ability to harness the power of humor and charm requires extensive practice, an art that Kardashian has undoubtedly mastered.",rewrite_generation

The country superstar opened up about his romance with the No Doubt frontwoman in a new interview with Billboard magazine.  As previously reported, Shelton told Stefani that he was splitting from Lambert during a meeting with their Voice coworkers. The “Misery” singer, who was new to the team at the time, got emotional.  “I won’t forget that day. I looked over at Gwen — who I didn’t really know — and she had these huge tears in her eyes. I thought, ‘Wow, she feels super bad for me!’” Shelton recalled. “She didn’t tell me much, because we didn’t know each other at the time, but she said, ‘I’m going through something very similar to what you’re going through. I understand. And I hate it.’”  Stefani was dealing with her own breakup at the time with Gavin Rossdale. (As Us Weekly exclusively revealed, the Bush rocker was cheating on her with their children’s nanny, Mindy Mann.) They announced they were ending their 13-year marriage in August 2015, one month after Shelton and Lambert announced they were divorcing after four years.  The “Came Here to Forget” singer and Stefani leaned on each other for support during the difficult time. The closer they got, the more Shelton saw Stefani in a new light.  “That’s kind of how our friendship and bond started, that day. It went from that, to checking in on each other once a week through email — ‘This s–t happened to me, what happened to you?’ — to maybe three times a week, then every day, to ‘Hey, here’s my phone number if you ever want to text,’” Shelton told Billboard. “Next thing I know, I wake up and she’s all I care about, and I’m ­wondering if she feels the same about me.”  “Gwen saved my life,” he added. “Who else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician? You can’t even imagine the similarities in our divorces.”  The two teamed up professionally too. Shelton included their collaborative track, “Go Ahead and Break My Heart,” on his 12th studio album, If I’m Honest.  “When we recorded the vocals for some of these songs, I was only six months removed from when all the crap went down,” Shelton said of his split from Lambert. “When you have a broken heart — at least, when I do — you got to get it out of your system. You want people to sympathize with you.

In 1970, Wintour commenced her career as an editorial assistant for the newly launched Harper's & Queen fashion magazine. Even at that nascent stage, her aspirations of editing Vogue were evident, eventually fulfilled almost two decades later.

Wintour, from her inaugural issue onwards, swiftly implemented significant transformations within the pages of Vogue. Notably, these modifications were apparent right on the magazine's cover. Departing from the magazine's previous preference for tightly framed headshots, Wintour favored a more naturalistic style of photography, showcasing lesser-known models in outdoor settings. Moreover, Wintour's debut Vogue cover shattered conventions as it featured a model clad in jeans, the first of its kind, accentuated by a lavishly adorned T-shirt valued at approximately $10,000.

Amidst new rumors that Blake is having trouble in his relationship with Gwen Stefani, 47, an insider tells InTouch that Miranda wants to confront her ex to finally get closure. “It needs to be done,” the source tells the mag. “There’s still a lot of unfinished business between [Miranda] and Blake. She needs to look straight into Blake’s eyes, ask certain questions, and get answers.”  There are no plans set for this meeting to actually take place just yet, but the mag claims that if it does happen, Miranda plans to go in with a “clear head,” although that might not be so easy. “This could get heated,” the insider admits. “As soon as the emotions come up, [Miranda] may lose it.” This doesn’t mean the 33-year-old wants to get back together with her ex, though — actually, it’s just the opposite. She’s very happy with her man, Anderson East, 29, but feels a face-to-face with Blake is what she needs to fully be ready to commit to another relationship, according to the source.  “She feels that [she and Blake] have both grown so much since their divorce that meeting up is essential for them to have healthy relationships in the future,” InTouch’s insider says. “Who knows, maybe this meeting with Blake will have them walk away as friends.

Despite their divorce over two years ago, it appears that Miranda is now ready to have a sincere conversation with Blake and find closure. While rumors circulate about Blake facing difficulties in his current relationship with Gwen Stefani, an insider has shared with InTouch that Miranda is determined to confront her ex in order to gain clarity. The source explains, ""There are certain questions that need to be asked and answered, and it's time for them to address this unfinished business."" 

Although no specific plans have been made for this meeting, the magazine suggests that if it does happen, Miranda intends to approach the situation with a calm and collected mindset. However, the insider acknowledges that such an encounter may become emotionally charged, causing Miranda to potentially struggle with her composure. Despite this, it is important to note that Miranda has no intentions of rekindling any romantic relationship with Blake. In fact, quite the opposite is true: Miranda is currently in a happy relationship with Anderson East. The meeting with Blake is seen as a necessary step for her to fully commit to her current partner, as she believes that both she and Blake have grown significantly since their divorce. 

InTouch's insider further reveals, ""She feels that it is essential for them to meet in order to move forward and have healthy relationships in the future. Who knows, perhaps this meeting will allow them to part ways as friends. Either way, they will undoubtedly be in a better place after."" 

In regards to the alleged troubles between Blake and Gwen, it would be prudent to approach the OK! magazine report with skepticism. Recent photographs from August 20th show Blake and Gwen looking completely enamored with one another. Additionally, HollywoodLife.com has exclusively learned that the couple has plans for a delightful Labor Day outing together. It is safe to assume that Blake will reappear on Gwen's social media this weekend, indicating that all is well between the two.

According to an eyewitness who spotted them in LA, ""Corey was following Kris around while holding her handbag. It seemed as though she hardly acknowledged his presence."" 
Adding to Kris' disappointment, it is believed that Corey, previously associated with Justin Bieber as a road manager, initiated their separation. ""For a while now, she had been expressing her dissatisfaction with various issues, including his perceived lack of time spent together. Eventually, he reached a breaking point,"" disclosed a Star insider, noting Kris' devastation following the development.
Alone time appears to be an uncomfortable notion for Kris, as she strives to keep up appearances. Intriguingly, it is suspected that Kris and Corey had been projecting a united front in public for a considerable period, possibly due to declining ratings for their show, Keeping Up With The Kardashians. Kris is fervently determined to maintain the illusion of a harmonious existence.",rewrite_generation
gossipcop-4524134287,"No need to rush. Jennifer Lopez is not in a hurry to walk down the aisle with Alex Rodriguez, but she does want to spend the rest of her life with someone.  “I do believe in marriage,” the Shades of Blue actress, 48, told Harper’s Bazaar in a story published on Thursday, March 15. “And I would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship. But I’m not forcing anything right now.”  As far as her relationship with the 42-year-old former Yankees player, she said: “It’s good, it’s healthy; we communicate well. We understand each other’s lives in a way that most other people couldn’t.”  She added: “We both entered the public eye in our early twenties and overachieved right from the start. And that affects every dynamic in your life, from your family to your work to your relationships. We have a similar makeup.”  The pair celebrated their anniversary in February in Minneapolis, where the singer performed a concert ahead of the Super Bowl. During the show, she debuted her single “Us” written by Poo Bear and produced by Skrillex, and dedicated it to Rodriguez, who was in the audience. “We’ve been together for one year today. I don’t want to get all mushy or anything, but baby, this song’s for you. I love you,” she told the athlete while on stage.  When talking about how she chose the song, Lopez told the magazine that the lyrics fit right into where the couple were in their relationship. She said: “They played me about 20 different songs, and when I heard this one I was like, ‘Oh, this is relevant!’ Alex and I were just getting to know each other. And I was like, ‘Oh, my God, could this be? Could this be us?’”  Lopez was previously married to chef Ojani Noa for nearly a year in 1997, and dancer Cris Judd from 2001 to 2002. She later married singer Marc Anthony in 2004 and they called it quits in 2011. The pair share 10-year-old twins Max and Emme. The former Yankees shortstop shares daughters Ella, 9, and Natasha, 13, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis. They split in 2008 after six years of marriage.  A lot has changed in the “Dance Again” songstress’ life since her last relationship, and she said a lot of it has to do with really knowing herself. “When I was younger I spent a lot of time being half happy and half not happy,” she told the publication. “I know who I am and what I want. I also know my strengths and weaknesses. It took me a long time to get to a point where I could say something nice about myself. I’m glad I can do that now.”  Lopez remains optimistic as she continues with her career, raise her two children and make her relationship with Rodriguez work for the long run. “Baseball is just like life,” she said. “All you want to do is hit a home run.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!",1,en,"No need to rush.

gossipcop-5658990975,"Daniel Craig is returning as James Bond once again, even as he reportedly fights to save his marriage to Rachel Weisz at the same time. Craig has already announced his intent to return as 007 in the franchise’s 25th film, and according to the National Enquirer, he’s still struggling to salvage what’s left of his marriage.  The Enquirer’s source claimed at the beginning of 2017, “Rachel and Daniel haven’t been happy for a while, and nearly called it quits last year.” The report claims that the married couple was in two separate filming locations at the beginning of the year, but continued to stay apart even after wrapping their respective films. The Enquirer then claims that they finally reunited in July after not being seen together in ‘554 days’.  According to the sources, the minute the outlet attempted to lock down an exclusive on the couple’s rocky marriage, both Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig were seen arriving at New York’s Public Theater the next day, prompting the source to add, “The whole thing just seemed like too much of a coincidence. I don’t buy it for a minute.”  When you consider Daniel Craig’s own words, especially in the context of allegedly turning down a $150 million payday to star in two more James Bond films, he had stated, “Being on your own would be sad, sick, and weird. I don’t trust myself. I need that balance.” If these reports are to be believed, then Daniel Craig previously turned down starring in more Bond films to spend time with his family, but now – all of a sudden – he’s back to working on James Bond?  Either the report was never accurate to begin with, or he’s giving up on his marriage to Rachel Weisz. One would hope that the two have worked out whatever was troubling them in the first place, but given their own relationship and marriage histories – and how they’ve both jumped ship on long-term relationships at the drop of a hat – one wouldn’t be faulted for assuming that they are on their way to getting a divorce.  What do you guys think? Are Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz having marriage troubles, and is Daniel’s decision to take on the role of 007 again an indication that he’s giving up on his marriage? Or just a chance to have more career stability and/or cash in on a major paycheck? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images for Sony Pictures","Daniel Craig is set to reprise his role as James Bond in the franchise's 25th film, while simultaneously addressing rumors surrounding his marriage to Rachel Weisz. Despite their reported struggles, Craig has made it clear that he intends to return as 007. According to a source cited by the National Enquirer, there have been ongoing issues in the couple's relationship, prompting speculation about the future of their union. The source claims that at the beginning of 2017, Weisz and Craig's relationship was strained, nearly leading to a breakup. They were then separated due to work commitments, with the Enquirer noting that they hadn't been seen together for a span of '554 days'. However, the source questions the timing of these reports, as Weisz and Craig were seen together shortly after the Enquirer started trying to uncover details about their marriage. This has led to skepticism regarding the validity of these claims. It is worth considering Craig's own words on the topic, particularly in light of his alleged decision to turn down a $150 million offer to star in two more James Bond movies. He has previously stated his reliance on the balance that comes with being in a committed relationship, expressing his aversion to the idea of being on his own. Thus, if these reports are accurate, Craig's sudden commitment to another Bond film raises questions about the state of his marriage. It is hopeful that they have resolved their issues, but given their respective histories with relationships and marriages, one could speculate that divorce may be imminent. Ultimately, the decision to take on the role of James Bond again could be interpreted as either an indication of Craig's disinterest in his marriage or as an opportunity for increased career stability and financial gain.

gossipcop-4774142356,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.

There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T","Katie Holmes, known for her role in the hit show ""Dawson's Creek"", has been rumored to be facing relationship struggles with her boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise, and their daughter Suri. According to a report from RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were supposedly planning a grand wedding worth $300,000, with Suri acting as the bridesmaid. This union was seen as a way to solidify their relationship, which had been kept mostly hidden for the past five years. However, it seems that the 39-year-old actress and single mother recently discovered that Foxx, a 50-year-old Oscar-winning actor, was not willing to give up his flirtatious tendencies, including maintaining a friendly relationship with his ex-girlfriend and mother of his 8-year-old daughter, Kristin Grannis. RadarOnline alleges that Foxx even brought Grannis as his date to Leonardo DiCaprio's birthday party in November. Realizing that her partner was not ready to commit, Holmes decided to call off the wedding and quietly break up with Foxx.

According to a source quoted by RadarOnline, Holmes became aware of Foxx's lack of respect towards her when he refused to sign a prenuptial agreement that included a no-cheating clause. This behavior caused Holmes to question the health of their relationship and the impact it would have on herself and her daughter Suri. Holmes felt the need to protect both of them. In addition to this ordeal, Holmes has also reportedly been dealing with her ex-husband Tom Cruise's attempts to reconnect with their daughter. Hollywood Life references a report from Star magazine, stating that Cruise regrets not being a present father for the past five years due to pressure from his Church of Scientology. The report suggests that Cruise is eager to become an active part of Suri's life once again.

The Star also claims that Holmes agreed to remain silent about Cruise and Scientology if he promised to stay away from their daughter and not engage in any attempts to influence her involvement with the controversial religious organization. Nevertheless, Holmes finds herself torn between her desire to protect Suri and her possible willingness to consider a reunion between Cruise and their daughter. According to an insider quoted by the Star, Holmes is slowly warming up to this possibility because she believes that Suri misses her father. She is cautiously considering this reconciliation while taking steps to ensure that Cruise does not bring his religious beliefs into their relationship.

Representatives for Holmes have denied both the breakup rumor about her and Foxx, as well as the report about a possible reunion between Cruise and Suri. Notably, Holmes' publicist, Leslie Sloane, has come forward to debunk the rumors, attaching her name to her statement. This marks the first on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx about the existence of their relationship, as they had gone to great lengths to keep it secret since reportedly starting dating in 2013. This secrecy was likely due to Holmes' divorce settlement from Cruise, which allegedly prohibited her from publicly dating for five years post-breakup. In September 2017, reports emerged suggesting that Holmes and Foxx had deliberately been photographed together on a Malibu beach, signaling the expiration of the five-year public dating ban.

Despite these denial statements, it is evident that the situation is complex and full of varying perspectives. The emotions and considerations involved in Holmes' relationships with Foxx and Cruise, as well as her role as a mother to Suri, are weighty and require careful handling.",rewrite_generation

Ninaki revealed, ""The way she handled it, Trevor definitely had the rug pulled out from under him. He was hurt."" While Trevor experienced heartbreak, Meghan seemed to be less affected by the separation.

Ninaki explains that she visited a heartbroken Trevor after their split, while Meghan appeared less affected.

Ninaki also shares that Meghan harbored aspirations of fame. ""She just loved to be the centre of attention,"" Ninaki said. ""We used to imagine her receiving an Oscar.

Additionally, Meghan's interest in the Royal Family was evident to Ninaki, despite Meghan claiming to have known little about Prince Harry when they first met.

But for Victoria Adams, then known as Posh Spice, it turned out to be a key moment in her personal life too.  The video would soon catch the eye of Premier League soccer player David Beckham, who immediately picked out the brunette Spice Girl in her black PVC catsuit and matching gloves.  He declared: “That’s the girl for me and I'm going to get her! She's my idea of perfection. I knew that if she wanted me, we would be together forever.”  They later met at a Manchester United soccer players’ lounge, where it was love at first sight—although Victoria later admitted she was a little tipsy at the time.  The couple married in 1999 and had four children; sons Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz, and Harper. The pair have also forged a successful brand over their almost 20-year marriage, with Victoria starting a successful fashion label after attempting a less-than-stellar solo music career.  However, it hasn’t all been so rosy. The couple have endured a number of accusations of infidelity on David’s behalf, including from his former personal assistant Rebecca Loos in 2004.  The couple’s former nanny, Abbie Gibson, came forward in 2005 to stay their marriage was a sham, a claim hotly disputed by the Beckhams.

It was within this visual masterpiece that Premier League soccer player David Beckham was captivated by the dark-haired Spice Girl, donning a black PVC catsuit and matching gloves.

She was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.[11] Her early attempts at modeling, at her mother's insistence, proved unsuccessful.[14][15] She then transferred to Moreno High School, an alternative school, where she became a ""punk outsider,""[14] wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing, and experimenting with knife play with her live-in boyfriend.[11] She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director,[12] taking at-home courses to study embalming.[16] At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies,[9][14] though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation, ""I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk kid with tattoos.""[17] As a teenager, Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she self-harmed,[18] later commenting, ""For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me.""[19] She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder,[16] and began experimenting with drugs; by age 20, she had used ""just about every drug possible,"" particularly heroin.[20] Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicide—at age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her.[12] When she was 24, she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center's psychiatric ward.[12] Two years later, after adopting her first child, Jolie found stability in her life, later stating, ""I knew once I committed to Maddox, I would never be self-destructive again.""[21] Jolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father, which began when Voight left the family when his daughter was less than a year old.[22] She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press.[23] They reconciled when they appeared together in","Please note that important aspects of the passage provided, such as names and dates, have been altered or removed to prevent individual identification and potential misuse.

gossipcop-1551062653,"  George Clooney and his wife, Amal, attend the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. (Alberto Pizzoli/AFP via Getty Images)  Once the ultimate bachelor — and two-time People’s Sexiest Man Alive cover model — George Clooney entered entirely new territory this week.  The Oscar-winning actor and his human-rights-lawyer wife of two years, Amal, announced Tuesday that they are the proud new parents of twins, Ella and Alexander.  Clooney has donned many hats in his life — actor, director, producer and activist, but fatherhood had always seemed far away. Was it the early-onset-salt-and-pepper hair? The coterie of models who found themselves on his arm for fleeting moments over the years? The insistence by tabloids and fellow co-stars that it was time for him to settle down? Maybe. Or perhaps it was the simple fact that Clooney himself said again and again that he would not reproduce. In several interviews. Many, many times. For many, many years.  A first-time father at 56, Clooney was often asked throughout his career whether the single life was his ultimate future. But after proposing marriage to Amal in April 2014 and marrying her that September (as well as sharing wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain), it seemed as if anything was possible for the man who once said, “I don’t see myself ever having kids.”  But it was a long road to get there. “I don’t have that gene that people have to replicate,” he told People in 2006.  When Esquire asked him why he wasn’t married with kids, he replied, “I haven’t had aspirations in that way, ever.” And as for people who thought it was weird that a man in his 50s was single and childless? “What do you do? Should I go, ‘I got to get me some kids right now!’ and rush out and impregnate someone?”  Clooney seemed to express frustration when asked how he could ever relate to the fathers he occasionally portrays onscreen. His answer: “Well, I’m also not running for president, but I played that role in ‘Ides of March.’ I wasn’t an actual lawyer when I did ‘Michael Clayton,’ and I don’t fire people for a living like I did in ‘Up in the Air.’ ”  “I keep saying I’ll never get married again or have children but people just don’t want to believe me,” Clooney told Britain’s Daily Express just three months before popping the question to his now-wife.  Of course, celebrities are people, too, and it shouldn’t surprise anyone that a man might change his mind around the midcentury mark. And Clooney is certainly not alone in choosing to wait till later in life to welcome a child into the family: Comedian Steve Martin became a father at age 67 in 2012; Elton John was 63 when he had a baby via a surrogate in 2010; and Chris Noth was 53 when he welcomed his only child in 2008.  Perhaps it’s the fact that Clooney always seemed so delightfully and devilishly Clooney-ish that made his bachelordom seem like the only constant in our ever-changing popular culture. But we can rest easy knowing that despite some hesitation about having a family over the years, his sense of humor has remained steady throughout.  “Ella, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine,” the statement announcing the birth of the twins read. “George is sedated and should recover in a few days.”",1,en,"  George Clooney and his wife, Amal, attend the 2016 Cannes Film Festival.

Previously embraced as the ultimate bachelor, adorned twice on the cover of People's Sexiest Man Alive, Clooney now embarks on a transformative journey. Delighting their supporters on Tuesday, the couple proudly shared their status as new parents, joyfully welcoming their twins, Ella and Alexander. Throughout his versatile career as an actor, director, producer, and activist, Clooney had seemingly distanced himself from the concept of fatherhood. Could it have been his graying hair, the fleeting presence of models on his arm, or the persistent suggestions of settling down from tabloids and co-stars? Conceivably. Alternatively, it could be attributed to Clooney's consistent declarations, repeated numerous times in countless interviews over many years, stating his disinterest in having children. Consequently, the 56-year-old first-time father contended with frequent questioning about his future as a bachelor. However, everything changed in April 2014 when he proposed to Amal, culminating in a September wedding. The couple even shared their wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain, thereby offering a glimpse into their newfound happiness. As Clooney himself once declared, ""I don’t see myself ever having kids."" Yet, the path to parenthood was undeniably extensive. ""I don’t have that gene that people have to replicate,"" Clooney shared candidly with People in 2006. When Esquire inquired about his unmarried and childless status, Clooney responded with a lack of aspiration. He mused, ""I haven’t had aspirations in that way, ever."" Regarding skepticism surrounding his lifestyle as a single man without children in his 50s, Clooney facetiously questioned whether he should abruptly change course and seek fatherhood in haste. Reflecting on his ability to connect with his onscreen portrayals of fathers, Clooney challenged the notion. He likened the situation to his roles as a president in ""Ides of March,"" a lawyer in ""Michael Clayton,"" or a professional ""firer"" in ""Up in the Air,"" stating that his acting prowess extended beyond personal experience. Clooney jokingly expressed his exasperation, affirming his stance on marriage and children just three months before proposing to Amal in an interview with Britain's Daily Express. Dismissing any surprise, Clooney joins a lineage of celebrities who chose to embrace fatherhood later in life. Entertainer Steve Martin welcomed his child at the age of 67 in 2012, Elton John became a father at 63 through surrogacy in 2010, and Chris Noth embraced fatherhood at 53 in 2008. While Clooney's persona has always been marked by delightful and devilish charm, his decision to become a parent showcases the evolving nature of our ever-changing popular culture. In the statement announcing the birth of his twins, Clooney's humor remained intact as he assured everyone of their health and happiness. He joked that he would require some time to recover while providing his assurance that he was sedated and would soon be back on his feet.",rewrite_generation

However, it is important to clarify that Sheeran did not violate any friendship code between him and Swift. Reports suggesting otherwise are unfounded and misleading.

""I am directing it personally... and we’re pursuing it aggressively.""            Sessions also said that there are currently 27 open investigations regarding leaks of classified information. ""In the last two years before I became Attorney General there were each year there were three open investigations of classified leaks now we have 27,"" he noted.      MARIA BARTIROMO: There are felonies apparently that have already taken place. I mean we had on this program just last week, the chairman of the Intel committee Devin Nunez and he said there are felonies that are going, not looked at all they’re going by over and over listen to what he told me just last Sunday.    REP. DEVIN NUNES: The big felony in all of this that nobody talks about from the very beginning was the leak of highly classified information when they leaked the phone call of the Russian ambassador talking to General Mike Flynn right before the inauguration. That was a felony, nothing’s ever been done about it.    BARTIROMO: Is your office investigating this sir?    SESSIONS: That is a violation of the law, to leak classified documents and it is being investigated. I will say this, the last two years before I became Attorney General there were each year there were three open investigations of classified leaks now we have 27 we’re going after this aggressively. I am directing it personally, some of the matters involve this matter and some of it is a matter I am not recused on and we’re pursuing it aggressively.","Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in a recent interview with FOX News Channel's 'Sunday Morning Futures' hosted by Maria Bartiromo, has expressed the Justice Department's strong commitment to investigating the leak of a phone call between former national security advisor Gen. Mike Flynn and the Russian Ambassador. Sessions emphasized the department's proactive approach in dealing with this matter.

""We’re fully committed to pursuing this issue with utmost determination,"" Sessions stated regarding the leak of the transcript of Flynn's call. ""I am personally overseeing the investigations and our efforts are vigorous and thorough.""

Furthermore, Sessions highlighted the substantial increase in open investigations relating to leaks of classified information, stating, ""In the last two years before I took the position of Attorney General, there were only three open investigations per year. However, the number has now risen to 27.""

During the interview, host Maria Bartiromo discussed the seriousness of the situation, noting, ""There have already been alleged felonies committed. Last week, we had Congressman Devin Nunes, chairman of the Intel committee, who highlighted the issue of these felonies, which have not been duly addressed. Let me remind you of what he said on our show just last Sunday.""

Congressman Devin Nunes, in his appearance on the show, emphasized the gravity of the leak by stating, ""The most significant felony that has been overlooked since the beginning is the leak of highly classified information involving the phone call between the Russian ambassador and General Mike Flynn, which occurred just before the inauguration. This leak is a clear violation of the law and yet no action has been taken.""

Given the significance of the matter, Bartiromo asked Attorney General Sessions if his office is actively investigating this incident. Sessions promptly responded, acknowledging, ""Leaking classified documents is an illegal act, and rest assured, it is being thoroughly investigated. I must emphasize that prior to my tenure as Attorney General, there were only three investigations of such leaks per year. However, our current efforts have led to an unprecedented number of 27 investigations. We are resolutely committed to addressing this issue. I personally oversee some of these investigations, while others fall outside my recusal, and we are pursuing all of them with tenacity and focus.""",rewrite_generation

The actor appears on the September cover of GQ where he explained why he chooses to stay very quiet when it comes to his private life.  “I always think the risk reward is very much weighted in the wrong direction,” Pattinson, 31, said of opening up in interviews. “If I could stay silent, I would.”  Pattinson has been dating singer F.K.A. Twigs since 2014, and recently told Howard Stern they were “kind of” engaged. But when asked by GQ if he was getting married, the actor — who revealed he calls his girlfriend Twigs — responded with a noncommittal “eh.”  Daniel Jackson/GQ  Pattinson said that he went to therapy a few years ago – and his therapist commented that he was good at “talking without saying anything.” He said he uses that skill in all his interviews. The Good Time actor explained that he chooses to stay private so people don’t form ideas about his personality that may later change and label him as dishonest.  RELATED: Celeb Quotes of the Day: Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone & More  “I want to be misunderstood,” he told the magazine after declining to talk about anything personal. “People are always changing, and the more you put something down in print, people form opinions and they’re constantly creating who they think you are. If you do something that contradicts that, or if you do something which goes out of that box, then you can look like a liar or something like that.”  FROM PEN: Chrissy Metz on ‘This Is Us’, Crying on Set, and Her Body Positivity  The actor also revealed the great lengths he’d go to during the height of the Twilight whirlwind to a little privacy. He recalled how he would have different cars parked around Los Angeles with a full change of clothes. If he noticed he was being followed by paparazzi, he would pop into the garages, change, and leave in a different car.  He would also try to confuse photographers by having all of his friends order different rides out of restaurants when they were together and sending the cars to different places after trading outfits with one of his friends. Pattinson also recalled riding in trunks several times to hide from the photographers – and once drove around all night when one was tailing him to find out where his new house is.  “There are ways to disappear, like, fairly easily,” he said. “It just involves effort, and most people can’t be bothered to put the effort in.”  Good Time hits theaters August 11.",1,en,"After years of overexposure thanks to his star-making turn in Twilight, Robert Pattinson values his privacy.

In a candid interview featured on the September cover of GQ, the actor elaborated on his preference for keeping his personal life closely guarded. ""The balance between risk and reward is often skewed in the wrong direction,"" shared the 31-year-old star when discussing the challenges of opening up in interviews. ""If given the choice, I would opt to maintain silence.""

Pattinson has been involved romantically with singer F.K.A. Twigs since 2014, and recently mentioned during an interview with Howard Stern that they were ""kind of"" engaged. However, when GQ inquired further about his marital status, the actor responded with a noncommittal ""eh."" 

Pattinson recounted a valuable insight gained from therapy a few years ago about his ability to ""talk without saying anything,"" which he admits he utilizes in all his interactions with the media. The Good Time actor explained that his desire for privacy stems from a desire to prevent the formation of fixed perceptions about his personality that may later prove to be inaccurately aligned, potentially leading to accusations of dishonesty.

""I aspire to be misunderstood,"" he articulated to the magazine, firmly refusing to delve into any personal matters. ""People evolve incessantly, and by committing thoughts to print, individuals form opinions that concretize an image of who they believe you are. Should you undertake actions that challenge or deviate from this preconceived notion, you risk being unjustly labeled or accused of being deceptive.""

Pattinson also shared anecdotes about the lengths he has gone to in order to secure a semblance of privacy amid the frenzy surrounding the Twilight phenomenon. Recalling his tactics during paparazzi pursuits, he disclosed his strategic placement of various cars across Los Angeles, complete with spare outfits for quick changes. Should he detect the presence of an unwelcome entourage, he would conveniently disappear into a nearby garage, change attire, and emerge driving a different vehicle. Moreover, he would confound photographers by arranging for different rides to whisk away him and his friends after meals, exchanging garments with a companion to further confuse onlookers. Additionally, on multiple occasions, the actor mentioned resorting to traversing in car trunks or driving aimlessly throughout the night to elude the relentless pursuit of photographers. 

""There are indeed methods of dissipating into anonymity,"" he asserted. ""Yet, they demand tireless exertion, an effort that most individuals are simply disinclined to exert.""

Months later, NW magazine published a claim that the couple actually wed in Liam's native Australia when Miley flew there to spend New Year's Eve with her beau.  #spicy A post shared by Liam Hemsworth (@liamhemsworth) on Mar 6, 2018 at 7:13am PST  Miley Cyrus Liam Hemsworth  Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth met in 2009 on the set of The Last Song. They began dating and got engaged in 2012. Two years later, Miley and Liam called it quits.  After some time apart, the couple decided to get back together in 2016. They jumped right back into being engaged and rumors have been swirling about the two tying the knot ever since.","Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth have reportedly taken the next step in their relationship and have quietly tied the knot. According to insider reports, the couple had a secret wedding ceremony at their Malibu home, in a laid-back, ""hippie-style"" celebration. The event was so intimate that even their neighbors were unaware it was a wedding, with the couple opting for a low-key gathering where children played freely. Miley wore a flowing white dress and embraced her love for animals by having them roam freely during the occasion. The menu for the day focused on vegetarian and organic options. The couple wrote heartfelt vows, expressing their love and commitment to each other, leaving not a single dry eye among the attendees. The couple decided to forgo external entertainment and instead serenaded their guests themselves. Miley sang a rendition of her godmother Dolly Parton's song, ""Islands in the Stream,"" while Wayne Coyne of the Flaming Lips performed a few songs of his own. The wedding was attended by close family members, including Miley's parents, siblings, as well as Liam's famous brothers, Chris and Luke Hemsworth. While the couple hasn't shared any photos from the ceremony, it is reported that they are planning another wedding ceremony in Australia to involve more of Liam's family. Moreover, Miley and Liam have expressed their desire to start a family, with Miley stating it has been her dream to have a baby. As for their relationship history, Miley and Liam got engaged in 2012 but called it off the following year. However, they rekindled their romance in 2016, with Miley noticeably wearing her engagement ring once again. In an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Miley confirmed her engagement and jokingly shared how different her engagement ring was from her usual quirky jewelry choices. The rumor mill surrounding Miley and Liam's wedding started in April 2017, and since then, there have been multiple reports about secret ceremonies taking place. The couple first met in 2009 while filming The Last Song and have had an on-again, off-again relationship since then. After their latest reunion, they dived headfirst into being engaged, leaving many speculating about when they would finally tie the knot.",rewrite_generation

Celebrity Big Brother is reportedly willing to make a significant investment to secure the presence of Caitlyn Jenner in the upcoming series of the show. Jenner recently arrived in London to promote her new autobiography, ""The Secrets Of My Life"", leading to speculation about a potential secret meeting with the show's producers. Sources from the Daily Star have revealed that the bookers are highly interested in having Jenner on the show, recognizing her potential as a ratings-boosting asset due to the global fascination with her story. 

Jenner's experience in reality television is well-established, having been a prominent figure on ""Keeping Up With The Kardashians"" and having her own show, ""I Am Cait"". Given the ongoing tension within the Kardashian/Jenner family, this appearance could offer Jenner a chance to address any misconceptions and clarify her perspective. In a recent interview on Australia's Today Show, Jenner expressed her love for Kim Kardashian but admitted that they haven't communicated in a while, choosing to keep her distance in order to minimize drama. 

Kim Kardashian, in turn, defended her mother Kris during a recent interview with Ellen DeGeneres, suggesting that Jenner may not be entirely truthful in her memoir. Kardashian expressed sympathy for her mother, emphasizing that she believes the claims made by Jenner are unnecessary and unfair.

gossipcop-7658353025,"“A Star Is Born” is that thing we always yearn for but so rarely get to see: a transcendent Hollywood movie. It’s the fourth remake of a story that dates back to 1932, but this one has a look and vibe all its own — rapturous and swooning, but also delicate and intimate and luminous. It’s set in the present day, but in spirit it’s a sophisticated retro ’70s drama built around the uncanny flow of feeling that develops between the movie’s two stars: Bradley Cooper, who plays Jackson Maine, a hard-drinking, bad-ol’-boy redneck rock ‘n’ roller who is still hanging on as a popular attraction but has lost the lust for what he’s doing, and Lady Gaga, in her fetching and accomplished movie-star debut, as Ally, an ingenuous, fresh-faced singer-songwriter who becomes his lover and stage partner before rocketing on her own into the new pop stratosphere. She takes off as he slowly crashes — that’s the soapy tragic “Star Is Born” concept. But what the movie does is to take this fabled melodramatic romantic seesaw and turn it into something indelibly heartfelt and revealing. Cooper directed the movie himself, working from a script he co-wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, and to say that he does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment. As a filmmaker, Bradley Cooper gets right onto the high wire, staging scenes that take their time and play out with a shaggy intimacy that’s shorn of the usual “beats.” The new “Star Is Born” is a total emotional knockout, but it’s also a movie that gets you to believe, at every step, in the complicated rapture of the story it’s telling.

It seemed stranded, with a kind of campy sincere ineptitude, between three worlds: Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand rock-princess fantasy. But from the electrifying opening moments of the new version, in which Jackson, boozy and raw, with his sunburned squint and hard-bitten shit-kicker sexiness, takes the stage of a gigantic stadium and launches into a grinding slow rocker that sounds like “Victim of Love”-era Eagles as done by the Allman Brothers, the movie is thrillingly authentic.

Jackson, who looks to be in his mid-40s, has been around long enough that he now occupies a grey zone between legend and nostalgia.

In the first of many telling jump cuts, the film leaps from his on-stage glory to Jackson slinking into the back of his car, weary and alone, grabbing the bottle of gin he’s got stashed there. He takes a guzzle, and Cooper, acting with his body, lets you feel just how much Jackson (between sickly coughs) needs the lifeblood of that drink. It’s what he believes in more than the show he’s just finished. How do you play a drunk? We know, of course, that the answer is not to “play drunk,” but Cooper doesn’t just avoid the usual slurry shambling (though at key moments he does a little of that too, and it’s powerful). He brings off something I’ve rarely seen done this exquisitely: He plays blitzed, very functional and in his element, his smile and reflexes greased by the liquor. Jackson speaks in a deep, low, deliberate Southern-stud growl — a voice with real music in it, though one that lets you taste all the booze it’s marinated in. Needing another drink, he has his driver drop him off at the first available bar, which turns out to be a roadside dive on drag-queen karaoke night. It’s not his scene, but he doesn’t mind. He’s the same celebrity everywhere he goes, so he’s in the perfect mood of lit-up contentment when she walks on stage. She is Ally, the one non-drag performer of the night (she’s friends with all the queens there, so they let her sing for real). When she enters the room, the movie pulls off a neat trick. We’ve already seen Ally break up with her boyfriend over the phone, letting out a banshee wail in the process, and when she appears in heavy white-make up and pasted on half-circle eyebrows, her hair teased into a punked-out French pastry, then does a strutting-down-the-bar version of “La Vie en Rose” that she milks for every flourish of theatrical kitsch she can, we think, “Of course! How Gaga-netic!” Backstage after the show, Jackson gently pulls off one of Ally’s eyebrows and asks her out for a drink. But when she emerges from the dressing room","""A Star Is Born"" is an exceptional Hollywood film that captures the transcendence we all yearn for but rarely witness. This fourth adaptation of an age-old tale, dating back to 1932, possesses a distinct elegance and atmosphere of its own. Its ethereal and intimate essence, coupled with its luminosity, makes it a truly remarkable experience. Although the story is set in the present, its spirit reflects a sophisticated retro '70s drama, centered around the profound connection formed between the film's two stars. Bradley Cooper, portraying the character of Jackson Maine, a weathered and weary rock 'n' roller clinging onto his fading popularity, and Lady Gaga, in her captivating and accomplished movie debut as Ally, an untainted and talented singer-songwriter, embark on a journey that propels Ally into the stratosphere of pop music while Jackson spirals downward. This classic tragic concept is transformed into an indescribably heartfelt and revealing masterpiece by Bradley Cooper, who takes the reins as director from a script he co-wrote alongside Eric Roth and Will Fetters. To say that Cooper does justice to the film would be an understatement. As a filmmaker, he fearlessly walks the tightrope, orchestrating deliberately paced scenes that exude an authentic and unscripted intimacy. ""A Star Is Born"" is a truly emotionally captivating experience, and it effortlessly instills a sense of belief in the intricate and spellbinding story it presents. In contrast, the 1976 version starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson contained a collection of sensational melodramatic love songs. Unfortunately, these pieces did not blend well within the stadium-rock era, and even Streisand's presence felt out of place, resulting in a film that teetered on the verge of ludicrousness. It seemed stranded, unsure of its identity amidst the realms of Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand's rock-star fantasy. However, in the electrifying opening moments of the updated ""A Star Is Born,"" where a boozy and rugged Jackson takes the stage with a sunburned squint and an irresistible aura of machismo, the film effortlessly captivates. With a grinding slow-rocker reminiscent of the Eagles' ""Victim of Love"" era as performed by the Allman Brothers, the authenticity of the movie becomes instantly palpable. This achievement is no small feat. Hollywood rarely manages to capture the essence of the rock world, but ""A Star Is Born"" not only serves as an immersive love story, but it also stands as the most authentic rock 'n' roll film since ""Almost Famous."" The film's genuine verisimilitude, which resonates visually, aurally, and emotionally, forms a solid foundation upon which everything unfolds. Jackson, appearing to be in his mid-40s, resides in a gray area somewhere between legend and nostalgia. While he can still fill arenas with adoring fans, his older hits have transitioned into beloved classics, and both his sound and persona have gradually slipped away from the zeitgeist. His entire outlaw persona, complete with a rugged beard and a rancher's hat, coupled with a combination of Kris Kristofferson and Lynyrd Skynyrd's rugged allure, positions him as a charming relic. Paradoxically, this image reflects an era when rock 'n' roll reveled in its authenticity. However, now that he is outdated, Jackson's authenticity serves as a showbiz facade, forever frozen in time. It's a role he continues to play, a persona he struggles to maintain secretly. Jackson possesses a signature ballad with the lyrics, ""Maybe it's time to let the old ways die,"" a song he likely wrote without knowing he was revealing his own fate. In a series of poignant jump cuts, the film transitions from Jackson's on-stage glory to a weary and desolate figure slinking into the backseat of his car, immediately reaching for the bottle of gin he has stashed for this very purpose. Through Cooper's masterful acting, the audience can truly feel the profound yearning for that drink, which Jackson believes in more than the captivating performance he just concluded. Portraying a drunken character is a challenging task, and Cooper expertly navigates this territory. Rather than resorting to exaggerated slurred speech, he skillfully portrays a functional drunk, seamlessly blending into his element. His grin and reflexes are fueled by liquor, while his voice emanates a deep, deliberate, and distinct Southern accent infused with the essence of alcohol. Desiring another drink, Jackson instructs his driver to take him to the nearest bar, which happens to be a roadside dive hosting drag-queen karaoke night. Although this setting isn't his usual scene, Jackson remains unfazed. Regardless of his location, he remains a celebrity, finding solace in the radiant contentment that accompanies his fame. It is during this fateful evening that Ally takes the stage, the sole non-drag performer among a sea of queens. The film executes a clever twist, juxtaposing Ally's powerful emotional outburst during her breakup over the phone with her transformation into an enigmatic figure adorned with heavy white makeup, exaggerated eyebrows, and a punk-inspired hairdo. Her rendition of ""La Vie en Rose,"" complete with theatrical flourishes, exudes a theatrical kitsch that is so quintessentially Gaga. Following the show, Jackson tenderly removes an eyebrow from Ally and extends an invitation for a drink. Emerging from the dressing room",rewrite_generation

Years later, Brad regrets leaving the Friends star for his now-ex Angelina Jolie, a source told In Touch exclusively.  Following his 2016 separation from Angie, Brad sobered up and sought therapy. And now, he’s “in touch with emotions and his true self like never before,” the source says.  Brad Pitt finally opens up about his bitter divorce with Angelina Jolie  And it seems like this self-awareness comes with some great realisations. “He has come to realise that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,” the source adds. “And while he’s not in love with Jen, he realises how much he does love her. Brad keeps telling friends that he’s seeing everything more clearly.”  However, these realisations are obviously far too late.

Years later, Brad regrets leaving the Friends star for his now-ex Angelina Jolie, a source told In Touch exclusively.  Following his 2016 separation from Angie, Brad sobered up and sought therapy. And now, he’s “in touch with emotions and his true self like never before,” the source says.  Brad Pitt finally opens up about his bitter divorce with Angelina Jolie  And it seems like this self-awareness comes with some great realisations. “He has come to realise that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,” the source adds. “And while he’s not in love with Jen, he realises how much he does love her. Brad keeps telling friends that he’s seeing everything more clearly.”  However, these realisations are obviously far too late. Jennifer has been married to Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for two years now.

Read full story","After seeking therapy and reflecting on his past, actor Brad Pitt has come to a profound realization about his former relationship with actress Jennifer Aniston. Sources close to the actor have revealed that Pitt deeply regrets leaving Aniston for his now-ex Angelina Jolie.

Following his separation from Jolie in 2016, Pitt made the decision to embrace sobriety and engage in therapy, which has provided him with a newfound emotional clarity. This newfound self-awareness has led him to acknowledge that leaving Aniston for Jolie was one of the biggest mistakes of his life. While Pitt may not be in love with Aniston currently, he has realized the depth of his love for her and expresses that he now sees things more clearly.

However, these realizations come too late, as Aniston has been happily married to her Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for the past two years. Pitt has no intention of interfering with her current relationship. Nevertheless, he does admit that he would seize the opportunity for a second chance at love with Aniston in a heartbeat, but strictly if the circumstances allowed it.

In addition to a romantic connection, Pitt aspires to have a professional partnership with Aniston. They previously collaborated successfully when they formed the production company Plan B in 2001. Pitt hopes to involve Aniston once again as he continues to produce and develop high-quality film and cable TV projects. This collaboration could be advantageous for both parties, as Aniston also desires to partake in prestigious projects under Pitt's production banner, aiming to achieve an Academy Award for Best Actress, an accolade that has eluded both her and Jolie.

It is evident that Brad Pitt still considers Jennifer Aniston the love of his life, concludes the source. Although the opportunity for a romantic reunion may be out of reach, it is apparent that Pitt values Aniston as a significant presence in both his personal and professional life.

It is hard to imagine a My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy — one of the greatest rap albums of all time — without an “Imma let you finish” at the 2009 VMAs.  His new album, ye, doesn’t merit any similar mercy.  On first listen, it doesn’t sound like any part of ye was recorded pre-MAGA hat picture, which blows a Kanye-head sized hole through the argument that the previous month’s behavior was a publicity stunt to promote the album. If anything, the album seems like an meek afterthought to the Twitter tirade and dive into right-wing politics. Most of it deals with the repercussions of the storm which came before it, and for the first time in his career, the artist’s personality is overwhelming the art.  The opening track ‘I Thought About Killing You’, if played in a vacuum, sounds like the work of a troubled mind. If a poem like this came from a loved one, it would surely merit discussion about a trip to the therapist. Kanye goes on to deliver cringe-worthy rhymes on issues ranging from Russell Simmons rape allegations to his petrification on realizing that his daughter might one day look like his wife. He teases a few tidbits of The Old Kanye, chopping up beats from Slick Rick and The Edwin Hawkins Singers samples on ‘No Mistakes’, to keep his fans just interested enough. It’s telling that the one standout track, ‘Ghost Town’ is the track on which Kanye lurks in the background, devoting more time on production than on spoken word, and letting John Legend and Kid Cudi take over.  If one were to ignore everything that came before ye, it would still feel like Kanye didn’t even try this time. The usual meticulousness and perfectionism has apparently been supplanted by a Kanye shrug. The music is haphazard and hollow, mirroring the guy making it. Maybe he’s become blasé and doesn’t want to spend time on music anymore. He did say he wanted to run for President in 2020 (or 2024?) anyway.",1,en,"In the past, Kanye’s capriciousness has been repeatedly forgiven and, at times, belatedly rewarded with accolades.

It is difficult to envision the masterpiece that is My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, one of rap's finest albums, without recalling the infamous ""Imma let you finish"" moment at the 2009 VMAs. However, his latest release, ye, does not warrant such clemency. Upon initial listening, it becomes apparent that no part of ye was recorded prior to the controversial MAGA hat snapshot, which dismantles the assertion that his prior month's actions were merely a calculated publicity stunt to promote the album. If anything, the album seems like a feeble afterthought to his Twitter rampage and foray into right-wing politics. The majority of the project revolves around the aftermath of the tumultuous events that preceded it, and, for the first time in his career, the artist's personality overwhelms the art. The opening track, 'I Thought About Killing You', when assessed in isolation, bears the markings of a troubled mind. Were this a poem authored by a loved one, it would undeniably prompt discussions about seeking therapeutic assistance. Kanye proceeds to deliver cringe-worthy lyrics, addressing topics ranging from Russell Simmons' rape allegations to his anxieties about his daughter resembling his wife in the future. He offers snippets of the ""Old Kanye"" on 'No Mistakes', slicing up beats from Slick Rick and incorporating samples from The Edwin Hawkins Singers, and manages to hold the attention of his fans, albeit just barely. It is noteworthy that the standout track, 'Ghost Town', is the one in which Kanye deliberately maintains a background presence, dedicating more time to production and allowing John Legend and Kid Cudi to take the lead. Even if one were to disregard everything leading up to ye, it would still feel as though Kanye exerted minimal effort this time. His usual meticulousness and pursuit of perfection have seemingly been replaced with an indifferent shrug. The music lacks cohesion and depth, mirroring the individual responsible for its creation. Perhaps he has become nonchalant and disinterested in music altogether, further compounded by his expressed desire to run for President in either 2020 or 2024.",rewrite_generation

Lisa Kudrow, in a recent interview with People, revealed that during her pregnancy in Seasons 4 and 5, her co-stars adjusted their pre-show ritual to include her unborn child, Julian Murray Stern, who is now 20 years old.

Prior to each performance, the cast members would gather backstage for a huddle, exchanging well wishes before going on stage. However, when Lisa Kudrow was expecting, her colleagues made a thoughtful alteration to this tradition. Kudrow explained, ""The six of us would do a huddle backstage and just say, 'All right, have a good show, love you love you love you love you.'

""And since they were divorced, I would spend two weeks with one and two weeks with the other, traveling with a tutor."" But wait, it gets better. Her maternal grandmother (can you guess..) is Hitchcock actress Tippi Hedren. Yes, that’s right, so clearly creative talent lies in that family. We’ve never heard of a family tree with so many famous names! Thanksgiving is probably a whirlwind. Now, Dakota Johnson is another famous name in that tree. 14 She’s An Animal Rights Activist advertising Just like her grandmother Tippi Hedren, Dakota Johnson is also an animal rights activist. Like grandmother, like granddaughter shall we say? As animal lovers ourselves, we’re pleased to hear that she’s following in her grandmother’s footsteps—both in acting and in animal rights. In 2014, Johnson saved 12 horses from being slaughtered by paying for them. What a sweet thing to do! We bet her grandmother was really proud. It’s always so great to hear about celebrities doing positive things - so naturally, we’re happy to hear of Dakota’s compassionate side. We admit we have a soft spot for animal lovers, but who doesn't? We always love hearing about people doing good deeds for animals and it’s always nice to hear celebrities using their celebrity title for the better. 13 She Grew Up Shooting Guns And Riding Horses In Colorado She may play the innocent and naive Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades movies, but growing up Johnson was anything but naive. She grew up in Colorado at her dad’s house, where she learned to build a fire, ride a horse, ride motorbikes, and even shoot a gun. And this was all before she was just 10 years old! Sounds like a badass kid to us! But when she wasn’t at her father’s house, she was at her mom’s house in L.A. which she also loved. It's hard to imagine a 10 year old these days shooting guns, riding motorbikes, or building fires without being grounded. But it sounds like she had a pretty inspiring and freeing childhood which makes us fall for the actress all the more. 12 She Never Dates advertising By the header, we mean she never has casual relationships. She only has long-term relationships. Good for her, is all we can say! You hear of so many celebrities who are constantly dating other celebrities. You can barely keep up with who they’re dating these days. It seems to be one guy or girl after another. So it’s great to hear of Dakota’s conservative views on relationships. Apparently she’s only ever been in long-term, serious relationships; she doesn’t just date. That probably explains why she’s been in a relationship with model Matthew Hitt since 2014. Yes, it’s been a kind of an on-and-off relationship but they’ve been in it for the long haul so far. So, to sum up, we like her whole dating attitude. The commitment is great and saves you a lot of time. 11 She HATED School It seems l",1,en,"Dakota Johnson; most of us know her as the actress from Fifty Shades of Grey. While we may have seen Johnson in some pretty intimate positions on-screen, there’s definitely a lot we don’t know about the Fifty Shades star. Like, for instance, the superfluity of familiar names in her family tree. Seeing that her popular movie, Fifty Shades Darker came out on the day of love—Valentine's Day—it's only fitting to dedicate a piece to the actress who brought us the sexy and quaint, Anastasia Steele. Johnson, after all, has become somewhat something of a Valentine’s Day staple, herself. Here are 15 facts about Dakota Johnson or, as some might call her, ""that girl from Fifty Shades of Grey."" We guarantee that she will no longer by ""that girl"" by the end of the list! 15 Her Family Tree Is Full Of Famous Faces You know how we said there are a few familiar names in her family tree? Well, we weren’t lying. Her parents are fellow actors, Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. Unfortunately, her parents divorced in 1994 so Dakota had to split her time between the two.

The commitment is great and saves you a lot of time. 11 She HATED School It seems like we have something in common with Dakota Johnson: a loathing of school. Okay, so maybe not all of you hated school - many of you probably loved school or at least thrived at school. But most of us can say with the utmost certainty that we hated school with a passion. We all have our reasons why. Johnson, for instance, hated school because she felt like an ""alien."" She said she didn’t understand the process of school as a child and felt ""suffocated."" I don't know about you guys, but I can totally relate with Dakota on this. Many of us felt like we didn’t really fit in at school so it’s especially comforting to hear that a big name like Dakota Johnson also felt like a social outcast in class. Like many of us, she preferred hanging out with her friends than going to school. But hey, we admire her honesty. 10 Auditioning Gives Her Panic Attacks advertising Watching the pristine-looking A-list celebrities gliding around the Golden Globes Award ceremony is enough to wreck your mind with self-doubt over their unbelievably high levels of confidence and self esteem. If only we could possess as much poise! The truth is, many of these celebrities don’t feel that way at all; confident and self assured, that is. Dakota Johnson, for example, gets so nervous during auditions that she often has panic attacks. And we’re not just talking a bit of breathlessness here and there, we’re talking full-on panic attacks—the real deal. So before you come to your conclusions that the celebrities you see on television and in magazines are way more confident than you’ll ever be, just remember something: every single one of them suffers from self-doubt at one point or another. It happens to all of","Dakota Johnson, widely recognized for her role in Fifty Shades of Grey, remains an enigma despite her on-screen intimacy. Beyond her portrayal of the alluring Anastasia Steele, there is much about the actress that remains unknown. Notably, her family tree boasts an abundance of familiar names, with her parents being fellow actors, Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. The familial bond, however, was severed in 1994, leading to Dakota's journey of splitting time and traveling with a tutor. Furthermore, her maternal grandmother happens to be none other than the renowned Hitchcock actress, Tippi Hedren, displaying a clear lineage of creative excellence.

In addition to her acting career, Dakota Johnson actively embraces the cause of animal rights, reflecting the altruistic spirit of her grandmother, Tippi Hedren. In a remarkable instance of compassion, Johnson purchased and saved twelve horses from an imminent slaughter in 2014. This noble act undoubtedly aligned with her grandmother's principles, and serves as a reminder of the positive impact celebrities can make when they leverage their influence.

While Dakota Johnson may embody the seemingly innocent Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades films, her upbringing paints a completely contrasting picture. Growing up in Colorado under her father's roof, she acquired a range of unconventional skills and experiences. From learning to build a fire and ride horses, to mastering the art of shooting guns and maneuvering motorbikes, Johnson's formative years were characterized by a remarkable sense of adventure and daring. Despite such a bold upbringing, she also relished her time with her mother in Los Angeles, creating a truly multifaceted childhood that contributes to her captivating persona.

In matters of the heart, Dakota Johnson adheres to a distinct approach. Known for her long-term commitment in relationships, Johnson diverges from the typical dating practices prevalent amongst her celebrity peers. Her conservative view on relationships is exemplified by her enduring affiliation with model Matthew Hitt, which has withstood the test of time since 2014. Her steadfast commitment demonstrates the value she places on emotional connection, a perspective worth noting in today's fast-paced dating culture.

Remarkably, Johnson openly admits to harboring a loathing for school, a sentiment many of us can relate to. She describes feeling like an ""alien"" and struggling to comprehend the purpose of formal education, ultimately feeling suffocated by the system. Johnson gravitated towards socializing with friends over attending classes, finding solace in companionship rather than conformity. Her candidness resonates with those who have experienced similar sentiments, highlighting the challenges many face within the confines of an educational institution.

It is essential to remember that the celebrities we idolize often grapple with self-doubt and anxiety, despite exuding confidence on the red carpet. Dakota Johnson exemplifies this truth, as auditions trigger panic attacks within her. The pressure and vulnerability she experiences speak to the universal nature of self-doubt, reminding us that even those we perceive as supremely self-assured battle their own internal demons.

In conclusion, Dakota Johnson's life encompasses a tapestry of compelling experiences and values that shape her identity beyond her fame as the ""girl from Fifty Shades of Grey."" Her lineage of renowned talents, commitment to animal rights, unique upbringing, conservative approach to relationships, disdain for formal education, and vulnerability in the face of auditions all contribute to her multifaceted personality. By delving deeper into her story, we unravel the layers of a truly captivating individual.",rewrite_generation

gossipcop-9811720113,"I, at least, struggle to understand her career. Her performance as a junkie in “The Town” features the “Bride Wars” of Boston accents. Her performance in “The Age of Adaline” — as a woman “cursed” to stay 30 forever — was like watching a mermaid ride a bike. She tries. But her acting hasn’t yet caught up to her algorithm-generated beauty. Alas, there may be no algorithmic solution for that.  So I was less than psyched at the prospect of seeing her shiver on a buoy, stitch her own wounds, talk to animals or play a Nancy. And, as refreshing as it is watching her stand on a surfboard, it’s refreshment that provides some perspective. While some actors make sense on movie screens, there are others who might make better sense on a can of something — beer, beans, air. I can hear you, Hudson skeptics. And all I can say is that the heart wants what the heart wants. I’d actually buy whatever Ms. Hudson was on the can of.  There might be no appreciable industrial difference between what a Kate Hudson can do versus your Blake Livelys. I don’t think they’re interchangeable, but sometimes the movies beg to differ, and the market corrects itself. Don’t fall in love with Mark Harmon, because here comes Kevin Costner. And sell your Brad Rowe stock, because he’s just going to be replaced by Brad Pitt. (In the late 1990s, that pretty much happened.) But there are continuums, too. Channing Tatum, for instance, is a more elastic, hip-hop-era Brendan Fraser upgrade.  Lots of parts that have gone to Ms. Lively feel as if Ms. Hudson could have played them. But something happened, and suddenly it was someone else’s turn to be “it.” (It’s always someone else’s turn.) And part of what annoys me about the lack of Kate Hudson in my life and the surfeit of Ms. Lively is the same thing that makes me angry when a perfectly good piece of software gets a superfluous update, or a zealous waiter takes my plate at a restaurant: I wasn’t done with that.",1,en,"I, at least, struggle to understand her career.

Her portrayal of a drug addict in the film ""The Town"" exhibits a perplexing amalgamation of Boston accents akin to the mismatched dynamic in ""Bride Wars."" Similarly, her performance in ""The Age of Adaline,"" where she plays a perpetually young woman cursed with eternal youth, is reminiscent of observing a mermaid effortlessly maneuvering a bicycle. Though she endeavors to excel, her acting prowess has yet to catch up to her algorithmically generated beauty. Unfortunately, it seems that there may not be an algorithmic remedy for this disparity. Consequently, I approached the notion of witnessing her tremble on a buoy, tending to her own injuries, conversing with animals, or assuming the persona of a Nancy with less enthusiasm. Nonetheless, witnessing her poised presence on a surfboard offers a refreshing perspective. While certain actors thrive in the context of motion pictures, there are others whose essence may be more aligned with a product like beer, beans, or even air. I am aware of the skeptics who question Kate Hudson's abilities, yet I believe that personal preferences transcend such concerns. In fact, I would willingly purchase any product endorsed by Ms. Hudson. The industrial disparity between the capabilities of actresses like Kate Hudson and Blake Lively may not be significant. Although I do not view them as interchangeable, there are instances when the film industry contradicts this notion and corrects itself through market forces. One mustn't become too infatuated with Mark Harmon, as Kevin Costner is bound to emerge as the next phenomenon. Similarly, it is wise to divest from Brad Rowe stocks as Brad Pitt emerges as the inevitable replacement. (This shift was quite evident during the late 1990s.) Nonetheless, there are gradients within this continuum. Channing Tatum, for example, represents a versatile, hip-hop-infused upgrade of Brendan Fraser's persona from a bygone era. Many roles typically assigned to Ms. Lively could have been effortlessly portrayed by Ms. Hudson. Yet, circumstances intervened, prompting another actress to take center stage. (It is always someone else's turn.) What frustrates me about the dearth of Kate Hudson's presence and the surfeit of Ms. Lively is akin to the annoyance felt when an otherwise functional software undergoes an unnecessary update, or when an overzealous waiter abruptly removes an unfinished plate at a restaurant: I had not concluded my experience.",rewrite_generation

The first time that she is mentioned in the novel is during the chapter ""The New Marguerite"", where it is revealed that she could not perform at the ceremony for the former managers. Later in the novel, she is threatened by Erik that if she performs at the Opera House ""a great misfortune will strike"". She shrugs the warning off and performs anyway. When she does, however, croaking noises come out of her mouth and the chandelier comes crashing down. Ashamed, she hides from the public view for a few weeks, before making a return to the opera house.  Carlotta is portrayed by Virginia Pearson in the original 1925 silent film with Lon Chaney. In 1929, new sound scenes were filmed and Mary Fabian was recast as Carlotta, due to the fact that she could sing. Virginia Pearson still appeared in new scenes, now playing Carlotta's mother. These changes are also the same in the 1929 silent, foreign cut of the film (which is most commonly viewed).  In the 1943 film version, she is Mme. Biancarolli who has been drugged by the Phantom and murdered along with her maid when she tries to force him to take off his prop mask.  In Andrew Lloyd Webber's production, Carlotta (last name Giudicelli) is from Italy and is one of the major singing parts. The opera company's prima donna, she despises Christine Daaé and sees the younger woman as a threat to her job and Phantom´s courtesan, when Christine achieves prominence due to the Phantom's dirty tricks. Carlotta and tenor Ubaldo Piangi are lovers; she often turns to him for consolation when things go wrong, and she breaks down crying when his murdered body is discovered onstage. The film reveals that she likes poodles.  In the Lloyd Webber-Joel Schumacher 2004 film version, she was played by Minnie Driver.[1] Due to Driver's lack of experience in opera, her singing voice was dubbed by opera singer Margaret Preece, although she lent her actual voice to the song ""Learn to Be Lonely"" during the end credits.  In Nicholas Meyer's novel The Canary Trainer, the characters of Carlotta and La Sorelli are combined into one, despite being mentioned as separate characters in the original novel.

Biancarolli who has been drugged by the Phantom and murdered along with her maid when she tries to force him to take off his prop mask.  In Andrew Lloyd Webber's production, Carlotta (last name Giudicelli) is from Italy and is one of the major singing parts. The opera company's prima donna, she despises Christine Daaé and sees the younger woman as a threat to her job and Phantom´s courtesan, when Christine achieves prominence due to the Phantom's dirty tricks. Carlotta and tenor Ubaldo Piangi are lovers; she often turns to him for consolation when things go wrong, and she breaks down crying when his murdered body is discovered onstage. The film reveals that she likes poodles.  In the Lloyd Webber-Joel Schumacher 2004 film version, she was played by Minnie Driver.[1] Due to Driver's lack of experience in opera, her singing voice was dubbed by opera singer Margaret Preece, although she lent her actual voice to the song ""Learn to Be Lonely"" during the end credits.  In Nicholas Meyer's novel The Canary Trainer, the characters of Carlotta and La Sorelli are combined into one, despite being mentioned as separate characters in the original novel. In Kim Newman's short story ""Angels of Music"" from the Tales of the Shadowmen anthology series, Carlotta is implied to be the ancestor of Bianca Castafiore from The Adventures of Tintin comic series.","Carlotta, a character brought to life by Gaston Leroux in his renowned 1909 novel The Phantom of the Opera, holds a significant yet brief presence on the pages. Hailing from Spain, she is introduced in the chapter titled ""The New Marguerite"", where it is disclosed that she had been unable to partake in the ceremony for the former managers. As the narrative unfolds, she finds herself confronted by Erik, who warns her of dire consequences should she dare perform at the Opera House. Undeterred, she dismisses the threat, only to face a humiliating ordeal during her performance. To her dismay, raucous sounds escape her vocal cords while the chandelier crashes down upon the stage. Consumed by shame, she withdraws from the public eye for several weeks before finally reclaiming her place at the opera house.

In the original 1925 silent film adaptation of Leroux's masterpiece, Carlotta is portrayed by Virginia Pearson, sharing the screen with the legendary Lon Chaney. Subsequently, in 1929, sound scenes were incorporated, leading to the recasting of Mary Fabian as Carlotta due to her singing abilities. However, Virginia Pearson remained, now assuming the role of Carlotta's mother. These alterations persisted in the 1929 silent, foreign version of the film, which is the most widely viewed rendition.

Fast forward to the 1943 film adaptation, where Carlotta takes on a new identity as Mme. Biancarolli. Entrapped and drugged by the Phantom, Mme. Biancarolli meets a harrowing end, along with her loyal maid, when she imprudently attempts to unveil the Phantom's concealed countenance.

In Andrew Lloyd Webber's illustrious stage production, Carlotta, now bearing the surname Giudicelli, hails from Italy and commands a prominent singing role. As the prima donna of the opera company, she harbors a vehement animosity towards Christine Daaé, perceiving her as a formidable rivalry jeopardizing her position. Moreover, Carlotta becomes entangled in the Phantom's deceptive machinations, eventually succumbing to her tears upon the heart-wrenching discovery of her lover, tenor Ubaldo Piangi, murdered on stage. An intriguing revelation from the film adaptation exposes her affinity for poodles.

In the 2004 film version helmed by Lloyd Webber and Joel Schumacher, the role of Carlotta is brought to life by Minnie Driver. Due to Driver's limited experience in opera, her singing voice is skillfully dubbed by opera singer Margaret Preece, while Driver herself lends her authentic voice to the captivating song ""Learn to Be Lonely"" featured in the end credits.

Lastly, Nicholas Meyer's novel The Canary Trainer presents a unique amalgamation of characters, merging Carlotta and La Sorelli into one, despite their individual mentions in the original novel. Even more intriguingly, Kim Newman's short story ""Angels of Music"" from the Tales of the Shadowmen anthology series hints at Carlotta being the ancestral connection to Bianca Castafiore of The Adventures of Tintin comic series.",rewrite_generation
gossipcop-178000221,"Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.

What is the ‘Kate effect’?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world. While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as “the Kate Effect,” ","Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, did not always hold royal status. However, even prior to her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton possessed a noteworthy net worth. Middleton enjoyed a comfortable upbringing and became the first commoner to wed into the royal family in 2011. Following her marriage, Middleton's net worth experienced significant growth. Here is a comprehensive overview of Middleton's financial standing:

What is the net worth of Kate Middleton? According to Wealth-X, a global wealth-tracking firm, the 36-year-old mother of three, who recently gave birth to a second baby boy in April, is valued at a minimum of £5 million or $7 million. However, alternative estimates place her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. It is important to note that the majority of Middleton's wealth exists in liquid assets, as she does not possess a personal real estate or art portfolio.

That being said, it is important to acknowledge that Middleton's net worth is significantly lower than that of her husband, Prince William. Wealth-X estimates Prince William's net worth to be at least $30 million, although some reports speculate that his fortune may reach closer to $40 million. Out of this total, $19 million is attributed to liquid assets. Wealth-X also highlights the fact that Prince William possesses a high-value helicopter, the Augusta A109S Grand, which is valued at $11 million.

What do we know about Kate Middleton's sources of income? The majority of Middleton's net worth originates from her parents' online party supplies business, Party Pieces. This company is estimated to hold a valuation of around £30 million, or $50 million, largely due to the exposure it receives through its association with the royal family. Prior to her marriage, Middleton was employed by the family business and worked as a part-time accessories buyer for the retailer Jigsaw. Additionally, Middleton and her siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, received an expensive private education, with tuition fees for a single child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000.

Kate Middleton entered into a marriage that provided her access to a tremendous fortune amassed over generations. As the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, they now reside in a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace. Prior to this, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the affluent Chelsea neighborhood of London, which is believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.

After officially becoming a member of the royal family, Kate's personal expenses decreased significantly. The majority of her living costs are covered by the private estate managed by Prince Charles, known as the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue generated by the Duchy of Cornwall assumes most of the financial responsibility for Prince Charles and his immediate family, including official travel expenses, wardrobe costs, housing, and staff salaries. Similarly, when Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry, it is anticipated that the Duchy of Cornwall will also bear the majority of her living costs associated with her royal duties. Markle's estimated net worth is deemed to be around $5 million.

What is the impact of the 'Kate effect'? As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate has become a global fashion icon, with her style choices influencing trends worldwide. While she does not personally profit from the economic activity generated by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has sparked a phenomenon known as ""the Kate Effect.""",rewrite_generation

It is what it is.” However she did come the close to discussing her relationship with Hassan, telling the publication that she dating and she is happy. “I used to feel guilty about taking personal time,” she revealed, “but I also think I never met someone who was worth it before,” she said about her romance with Hassan.","Rihanna and Hassan Jameel's relationship remains strong, despite rumors suggesting otherwise. The couple, who have been together for a year, have kept their love affair extremely private. This led to speculation in June that they had split, leaving fans eagerly awaiting proof of their continued togetherness. On July 9, such evidence emerged with pictures from their intimate getaway in Mexico.

In these photographs, the 30-year-old singer and the Saudi billionaire showcase their deep connection. Rihanna can be seen animatedly pointing her right index finger in the air while engaged in what appears to be a meaningful conversation. Hassan reciprocates this intensity, looking back at her with his hand on his chest, clearly engaged in a passionate discussion. The images speak volumes about the strength of their bond.

It is worth noting that earlier this year, Rihanna's previous relationship with Drake played out very publicly. The contrast is stark with her current romance, as she has gone to great lengths to keep her love with Hassan away from the prying eyes of the media. This commitment to privacy has only fueled speculation and rumors, exemplified by MediaTakeOut's claim that the couple had separated. Despite such rumors, it is evident that Rihanna and Hassan are enjoying a scorching summer together, relishing the privacy they have deliberately cultivated.

In a recent interview with Vogue, Rihanna admitted feeling uncomfortable when Drake publically expressed his love for her, stating that she doesn't appreciate excessive compliments and being put in the spotlight. Regarding her current relationship, she revealed that she is dating and happy, suggesting that her romance with Hassan is a significant departure from her previous experiences. In her words, she disclosed, ""I used to feel guilty about taking personal time, but I also think I never met someone who was worth it before."" This statement is a powerful testament to the depth of her relationship with Hassan.

In conclusion, Rihanna and Hassan Jameel's relationship not only endures but flourishes. Their commitment to privacy showcases a level of maturity and understanding that is often absent in the world of celebrity relationships. As they continue to support and cherish each other, it is clear that their love remains strong and steadfast.",rewrite_generation
gossipcop-6909849467,"Now, it’s official: Star Wars fans will have one final chance to say goodbye to Carrie Fisher, with Lucasfilm announcing that the actress, who died in December 2016, will appear in next year’s Star Wars: Episode IX.  In a statement, director J.J. Abrams sought to put concerns about potential CGI resurrections to rest, saying that the new movie will use “unseen footage we shot together in Episode VII” and assuring fans that “we were never going to recast, or use a CG character.” While this is, undoubtedly, comforting, it would also appear to offer particular clues about the role Fisher — or, more specifically, her character, Leia Organa — will play in the movie.  Firstly: Purely for practical purposes, Leia’s presence in the movie will be small. If nothing else, there can’t be that much extraneous, unseen footage from 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens; she was barely in that movie, so unless large swaths of scenes were shot but never even hinted at by anyone involved in the production, there’s limited material to draw from in the first place, and surely not everything available will be used.  Considering the context of the footage, it also limits the potential use for Episode IX. Leia appeared in few scenes and locations in The Force Awakens. Leia was on Takodana, rescuing Han, Chewbacca, Rey and Finn, and then at the Resistance base on D’Qar, where she takes part in planning, and later monitoring, the attack on Starkiller Base. Aside from brief interludes with Han and, later, Rey, she’s very much in “harried leader” mode throughout the movie. Does this mean that this is the Leia we’ll see in Episode IX, even after losing her ex-husband, and then her brother, in the previous two movies?  (It’s possible that the Fisher footage will end up being just a minor flashback, used to punctuate a contemporary moment; memories during her funeral, as some on social media have already suggested. If so, then the above problem is side-stepped, to a degree.)  Abrams’ comments leave space for some level of postproduction trickery to be applied to the Fisher footage. Presumably, Fisher will be intercut with new footage of actors shot specifically for Episode IX. Will digital trickery be used to make sure that Fisher shares a location with the other cast members? If so, will that be all that’s altered? What about costuming choices? For that matter, what about the potential for posthumous dubbing or soundalikes used for dialogue where Leia is off-camera or not in close-up? Abrams said that the movie would never use a CG character, but what about a performance augmented or altered by CG?  Of course, if any such edits or alterations are made, they’ll have to be done with subtlety and sensitivity. This is key to the entire enterprise of including footage of Fisher posthumously. For as much as fans want to be able to say goodbye to the actress, and also to Leia, they want to do so in a manner that feels appropriate and respectful to both. While Abrams and Lucasfilm — and Fisher’s family, especially daughter Billie Lourd, named in Abrams’ statement — want to provide both closure and tribute to Leia and Fisher alike with this move, they’re courting backlash if this isn’t done perfectly.  That the footage will come from The Force Awakens feels particularly fitting, then; that, after all, was a project that already came with expectations and looming accusations from fandom expecting the worst. It’s also perhaps a reminder that those involved with this move love the mythology — and loved Fisher as a person — as much as anyone else, if not more so, and will be approaching it with the utmost care.  Everyone will, inevitably, remain worried until the final product appears onscreen, but perhaps we can rest just slightly in the meantime.",1,en,"Now, it’s official: Star Wars fans will have one final chance to say goodbye to Carrie Fisher, with Lucasfilm announcing that the actress, who died in December 2016, will appear in next year’s Star Wars: Episode IX.

Everyone will, inevitably, remain worried until the final product appears onscreen, but perhaps we can rest just slightly in the meantime.","In an official announcement, Lucasfilm has confirmed that Star Wars fans will be given a final opportunity to bid farewell to the late Carrie Fisher in next year’s Star Wars: Episode IX. Director J.J. Abrams sought to allay concerns about the use of CGI technology, assuring fans that the film will incorporate unused footage that was originally captured during Episode VII. Abrams emphasized that there will be no recasting or reliance on computer-generated characters. While this news is undeniably reassuring, it also provides some insights into the extent of Fisher's appearance in the movie, specifically as her character, Leia Organa. 

It is important to note that due to practical limitations, Leia's presence in Episode IX will be minimal. Considering that there is unlikely to be a surplus of unused footage from Star Wars: The Force Awakens in 2015, as Fisher had limited screen time in that film, it is safe to assume that only a fraction of the available material will be utilized. This constraint raises questions regarding the role Leia will play in the upcoming film. In The Force Awakens, Leia was primarily portrayed as a determined leader, with her scenes centered on the rescue mission and battle preparation at various locations. Given the events of the previous two movies, losing her ex-husband and brother, will Leia still embody this role in Episode IX? 

One plausible speculation circulating on social media is that the Fisher footage may be utilized as brief flashbacks during significant moments or even in a memorial context. This approach could alleviate the challenge mentioned earlier. However, it is worth noting that Abrams' remarks suggest the possibility of utilizing post-production techniques to seamlessly integrate the Fisher footage with new scenes featuring the cast. This raises further questions: Will digital manipulations harmonize Fisher's presence with her co-stars? Will costuming choices present any challenges? And could posthumous dubbing or voice doubles be employed to depict dialogue in scenes where Leia is not on-screen or in close-up shots? Although Abrams has pledged not to employ a CG character, utilizing CG to enhance or modify Fisher's performance remains a potential consideration. 

Of course, any modifications made to the footage will need to be executed delicately and with the utmost sensitivity. Achieving this balance is crucial to the entire endeavor of including Fisher's posthumous presence in the film. Fans want to bid farewell to both the actress and the character she portrayed, and it is imperative that this is done in a manner that is fitting and respectful. Abrams, Lucasfilm, and Fisher's family, particularly her daughter Billie Lourd, who was mentioned in Abrams' statement, are determined to offer closure and pay tribute to both Leia and Fisher. Nonetheless, any missteps in the execution of these intentions could lead to backlash and disappointment. 

Given the source of the footage from The Force Awakens, it is poignant that this project, like its predecessor, carries high expectations and potential skepticism from the fandom. This also serves as a reminder that those involved in this endeavor share the deep appreciation for the Star Wars mythology and held Fisher in high regard, perhaps even more so than the fans themselves. Rest assured, the utmost care will be taken to handle this delicate situation. 

While concerns will inevitably persist until the final product is unveiled onscreen, we can, for now, find some solace in knowing that every effort will be made to execute this tribute flawlessly.",rewrite_generation

A replica of the world’s most famous “unsinkable” ship — which struck an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912, killing 1,503 people — is under construction, with a maiden voyage planned for 2018.  Australian tycoon and politician Clive Palmer — not J. Bruce Ismay — is at the helm of the ambitious project to faithfully recreate the luxury ship, which will be about 13 feet wider to meet current regulations.  More importantly, it will carry enough lifeboats for every passenger and its hull will be welded, not riveted, just in case it comes across a rogue iceberg, the Belfast Telegraph reports.  “The new Titanic will of course have modern evacuation procedures, satellite controls, digital navigation and radar systems and all those things you’d expect on a 21st-century ship,” James McDonald, global marketing director of Palmer’s company, Blue Star Line, told the paper.  The new nine-deck ship will be 885 feet long, about two more than her doomed predecessor, 174 feet high and have a maximum speed of 24 knots. She will accommodate 2,400 passengers — 177 more than the RMS Titanic.  It also will feature the same categories of passengers — from the first-class movers and shakers to the hoi polloi in third class, where poor Leonardo DiCaprio was berthed in the classic movie.

This replica of the renowned ""unsinkable"" vessel, famous for its tragic encounter with an iceberg on its inaugural journey on April 15, 1912, resulting in the loss of 1,503 lives, is currently being constructed. The maiden voyage of this ambitious undertaking, spearheaded by Australian tycoon and politician Clive Palmer, is scheduled for 2018. 

To meet contemporary regulations, this faithful recreation of the luxurious ship will be approximately 13 feet wider. Furthermore, it will have sufficient lifeboat capacity for all passengers, and its hull will be welded as a precautionary measure against potential iceberg encounters.

With a height of 174 feet and a maximum speed of 24 knots, it will accommodate 2,400 passengers, 177 more than the RMS Titanic.

This conclusion is supported by their recent appearance together at the 2018 Kids' Choice Awards, where they showcased a united front for their children.

In light of these developments, it remains uncertain when Mariah will be ready to fully commit to marriage once again. However, when that time comes, rest assured that our team will be eagerly awaiting the privilege of attending her momentous celebration.",rewrite_generation
gossipcop-8581615474,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.

There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T","Katie Holmes finds herself in a challenging situation, as numerous reports surrounding her personal life continue to circulate. These reports revolve around her romantic involvement with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, her ex-husband Tom Cruise, and their daughter Suri. According to RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of a wedding ceremony worth $300,000, where Suri would serve as the bridesmaid. This union would have solidified their five-year relationship, which has largely remained concealed from the public eye. However, it seems that Holmes became aware of Foxx's reluctance to abandon his flirtatious tendencies, including maintaining a friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother of his daughter. RadarOnline alleges that Foxx attended Leonardo DiCaprio's birthday party with Grannis, not Holmes. Consequently, Holmes made the decision to call off the wedding and privately informed Foxx of their separation. A source cited by RadarOnline claims that Foxx rejected the idea of signing a prenuptial agreement with a no-cheating clause, as he began to understand the potential consequences of being unfaithful to his partner. Holmes grew concerned about Foxx's behavior, recognizing the lack of respect and the detrimental effect it could have on herself and Suri. Meanwhile, Holmes has supposedly faced ongoing attempts by Cruise, her ex-husband and Hollywood superstar, to regain a place in their daughter Suri's life. Despite not having seen his daughter for over five years due to the restrictions imposed by his Church of Scientology, Cruise allegedly regrets his absence and wishes to play a more active role in Suri's life, according to reports in Hollywood Life based on Star magazine. The Star cites an insider who claims that Cruise, being a devoted Scientologist, unquestioningly complied with the instructions of church leaders who prohibited him from seeing Suri. However, Cruise has grown tired of being manipulated by these authorities and desires a reunion with his daughter. The Star also discloses an alleged agreement between Holmes and Cruise, wherein Holmes vowed to keep quiet about Cruise and the Church of Scientology, on the condition that Cruise steers clear of their daughter and avoids attempting to indoctrinate her into the controversial religious organization. Nevertheless, Holmes feels torn between her desire to protect Suri and the possibility of mending the relationship between father and daughter. As an insider informed the Star, Holmes is gradually considering the idea of a reunion, understanding that Suri may be yearning for her father's presence. Holmes is starting to trust Cruise's assurance that he will refrain from involving their daughter in his religious beliefs. Representatives for Holmes have dismissed both the reports of her breakup with Foxx and the potential reunion between Cruise and Suri. Notably, Holmes' publicist, Leslie Sloane, personally denies the breakup report and attaches her name to the statement. This denial holds significance, as it represents the first official acknowledgement, on record, from either Holmes or Foxx that their relationship exists. Holmes and Foxx have gone to great lengths to keep their relationship under wraps since they reportedly began dating in 2013. Holmes even disguised herself once to meet Foxx at a restaurant to avoid public attention. These measures were necessary as part of Holmes' divorce settlement with Cruise, which legally obligated her not to date anyone publicly for five years after their separation, as reported in September 2017. Speculation arose when Holmes and Foxx were photographed together on a Malibu beach, hand in hand, suggesting that they were aware of the paparazzi's presence and that the five-year public dating ban had expired.",rewrite_generation
