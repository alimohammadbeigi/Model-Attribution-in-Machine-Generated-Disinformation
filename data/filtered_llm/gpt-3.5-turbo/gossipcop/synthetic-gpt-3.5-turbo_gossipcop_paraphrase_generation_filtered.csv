Dancing With the Stars will return for its 22nd season with Len Goodman back where he belongs, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champ, and a baby boy or girl for Allison Holker. There's much to look forward to, but not before we close out this season one last time with everything that happened after the finale! (In case you missed it, you can read our recap of the best and worst moments here .) Almost an hour after Tom Bergeron declared Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough the winners of season 21, Bindi was still in disbelief, shouting from the top of her lungs, ""I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!"" Her exuberance and genuine nature endeared her to literally every one on set, but no one more so than Derek. ""It's just so special with Bindi,"" he told reporters backstage. ""She's a champion of life."" Bindi shared the same sentiment, telling those in the ballroom that she gained another brother in Derek. In case you needed further proof that the two are friends for life, consider this: Derek's hopping on a plane to Australia in a couple weeks ""to tackle crocodiles and get my official khakis!"" The Houghster may have nabbed his sixth Mirrorball trophy, but it was his partnership with Bindi that undoubtedly made it his favorite season. ""There's not a thing I would change about this season,"" he told Glamour post-show. ""There's not a week I would change, a dance I would change, and that was a very calming, very peaceful feeling. The show is a completely different show than the first time I won, and to win at this level and the standard that this show has been raised to, it's been incredible."" While Bindi and Derek make the press rounds in New York City, it's no secret that she's itching to get back to her hometown down under. ""I can't wait to get back to all the animals, continue all the conservation work, and carry on in my dad's footsteps."" Season 21 runner-ups Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter were understandably disappointed not to win the big prize, but they both praised Bindi and Derek for their phenomenal journey this season. ""Bindi was the whole package,"" praised the red-haired stunner. ""She and Derek had a beautiful partnership."" Still, ""it's bittersweet in may ways. Did I really want this to be my first Mirrorball? Absolutely. I would be lying if I said I didn't. But Bindi was undeniable this entire season. She grew so much, and she's just such a beautiful person you can't help but be captivated by her. Both [she and Nick] are winners, and I truly believe that."" Echoed Nick: ""It was just such a pleasure to be here. I didn't expect to get anything, so anytime something great happened in the competition, it was a pleasant surprise to me."" So what's up next for Nick? Well, aside from getting ready for Baby Boy Carter , his solo album ( All American ) drops today, and he has a movie coming out next year that he wrote and directed. As for third-place contestant, Alek Skarlatos , he'll be heading on the DWTS Tour this winter, but his immediate plans are much simpler: ""I can't wait to get on the plane tonight to eat. A lot.""

""Yeah, and we'd probably win,"" she laughed of the possibility of being paired with Mark's best friend and honorary brother. Speaking of Derek, Mark told us backstage that getting to perform with BC (who he called ""the love of my life"") while Derek and Bindi danced was his favorite part of the evening.

Dancing With the Stars is coming back for its 22nd season, featuring the return of Len Goodman, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champion, and the exciting news of a baby for Allison Holker. Before we get to the new season, let's take a look back at everything that happened after the finale. After being declared the winners of season 21, Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough were still in shock, with Bindi exclaiming, ""I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!"". Their friendship and partnership was evident throughout the season, with Derek even considering Bindi as a sister. In fact, he's planning a trip to Australia to experience her world. Although he has won the Mirrorball trophy six times, Derek said this was his favorite season and wouldn't change a thing. Bindi is eager to return to her wildlife conservation work in Australia. While Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter were disappointed not to win, they praised Bindi and Derek for their amazing journey. Nick has his solo album and a movie coming up, while Sharna plans to be Nick's wing woman on tour. Alek Skarlatos is looking forward to the DWTS Tour and his simple pleasure of eating. Allison Holker, despite being six months pregnant, was full of energy and happy to be dancing on the show. She's preparing for her first Thanksgiving and the arrival of her baby, which she'll reveal the gender of on social media. The return of Len Goodman as a judge next season was a big announcement backstage, and the pros were excited to have him back. Mark Ballas hopes to have his girlfriend compete on the show, although he joked that she might be assigned to Derek instead. Overall, it was a night filled with amazing performances and heartfelt moments.",paraphrase_generation

The son of an Army major, Strahan grew up in Germany and did not play competitive high school football until his senior year when his parents sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in Texas.  The former defensive end played well enough to earn a scholarship to Texas Southern University. By his senior year of college, he had set a record for sacks, which got the attention of the NFL.  In 1993, the New York Giants drafted Strahan as the 40th overall draft pick. Over the next 14 seasons, he became the league’s all-time quarterback sack leader, played in the Pro Bowl and helped the Giants defeat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII.  Upon retiring in 2008, Strahan concentrated on his off-field talents. In 2012, he became Kelly Ripa’s “Live! With Kelly” co-host, replacing longtime host Regis Philbin. Four years later, he left the show and joined ABC’s “Good Morning America”; it took more than a year for “Live” to announce Ryan Seacrest as its new co-host.  Strahan also serves as a Fox NFL Sunday analyst during the football season.  As of May 2017, Strahan’s net worth was $65 million, with a salary of $17 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.

The fashionable football star also launched his own clothing line in 2015 in JC Penney stores.  Along with Curt Menefee, Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long and Jimmy Johnson, Strahan appears on “Fox NFL Sunday” each week during the NFL season.

(This is always an exciting moment in a ceremony.) It was an extraordinary mix of tradition and modernity, of centuries of history and up-to-the moment flourishes. Oprah was here, and so was Meghan’s mother, an African-American social worker who wore a conventional mother-of-the-bride outfit and also a nose stud. It somehow looked charming and just right. The entire royal family was here, along with a complement of English aristocrats and important personages. The music was stately and beautiful. The setting was awe-inspiring. There was a flotilla of clergymen, an extraordinary mélange including the archbishop of Canterbury and — in a striking inclusion in this most ancient of places — the head of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Curry. Chosen to give the address to the congregations, Bishop Curry, who is African-American, quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His voice rising and falling with emotion, he made a big, generous, impassioned case for love as the most important thing there is, in religion and in life.

Photo Our fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, is also watching, and she has a quick take for us on Meghan Markle’s dress. It was absolutely simple: pure and sculptural, in double bonded silk cady with a wide boatneck, long sleeves and sweeping train. It was Meghan Markle’s wedding dress. It was by Clare Waight Keller, a British woman and the first female designer of Givenchy. And it was everything people had hoped. This was not a Cinderella choice, not one that spoke of fantasy or old-fashioned fairy tales. Instead, it placed the woman proudly front and center and underscored Ms. Markle’s own independence. At the same time, it celebrated female strength, promoted a local designer and reached a hand across to Europe (where Ms. Waight Keller has a day job). The five-meter veil was of silk tulle, with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads and organza, and contained embroidery representing the flora of all 53 Commonwealth nations.

But this looked totally fun for the guests — even more fun than, say, the Academy Awards — because no one was competing for anything and no one was forced to talk about their outfits to television reporters. Part of the change in tone is down to the passage of time and to how much Britain, or perhaps the royal family, has changed in the last few years. Another reason, of course, is that Harry, being the second son and not a future king, has the freedom to be more relaxed, less constrained by tradition, and less conventional than his brother. This wedding has nothing to do with dynasty, or ensuring the security of the royal line. (We hope they have kids! But only because it’s fun to have kids, not because it would be some sort of international crisis if they did not.) This wedding had everything to do with two people who are totally into each other and wanted to have a great big happy celebration. Oprah, Beckhams and Clooneys, oh my! Photo One of the great excitements about any wedding, of course, is the moment you learn who has been invited and who has not. Meghan and Harry’s list was kept secret, until the very moment that dozens of mysterious figures started to enter St. George’s Chapel. It was very exciting. There was none other than Oprah Winfrey, in a snug pink dress, a pair of very cool sunglasses and a massive broad-brimmed hat spectacularly festooned with flowers. If anyone qualifies as American royalty, it is surely Oprah, with her ability to transcend race and background, and her great gift for openness and emotional candor. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Kate Middleton’s parents, Carole and Michael, were there. They have always done such a good job of wearing appropriate outfits, smiling tastefully and saying nothing. There was Charles Spencer, the Earl of Althorp, Diana’s brother, perhaps known best for his active love life and his impassioned attack on the British media after his sister’s death. It turned into Celebrity Central. George and Amal Clooney made their stately, Hollywood-y entrance (She was in yellow with an interesting train). David and Victoria Beckham, a.k.a. Posh and Becks, came in and graced some people in the crowd with their conversation.","Both of them had a joyful and relaxed demeanor as they exchanged their vows. Fortunately, no one raised any objections to their marriage, an exhilarating moment during the ceremony. The event combined elements of tradition and modernity, blending centuries of history with contemporary touches. A notable presence was Oprah, as well as Meghan's African-American mother, who donned a conventional mother-of-the-bride ensemble alongside a nose stud, which surprisingly complemented her look. The royal family, English aristocrats, and important figures were all in attendance. The music was grand and beautiful, and the setting was awe-inspiring. The clergy members included a diverse mix, such as the archbishop of Canterbury and the head of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Curry. Bishop Curry's passionate address emphasized the importance of love in both religion and life, quoting Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Lady Jane Fellowes, Harry's aunt and sister of the late Princess Diana, delivered a reading from the Song of Solomon that expressed joy and seemed to signify a lifting of Harry's long-standing sorrow since his mother's passing. The wedding dress received high praise for its elegant simplicity, crafted from double bonded silk cady with a boatneck, long sleeves, and a sweeping train. Designed by Clare Waight Keller, the first female designer of Givenchy, the dress showcased Meghan's independence and celebrated female strength, while also promoting a local designer and bridging connections to Europe. The veil, five meters long, featured hand-embroidered flowers representing the various Commonwealth nations. The choice of Clare Waight Keller as the designer came as a surprise, as her name had not been associated with the rumors surrounding the dress. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex later departed for their evening reception at Frogmore House, with Meghan wearing a second dress by Stella McCartney. The guests at the wedding appeared to be thoroughly enjoying themselves, creating an atmosphere similar to a star-studded cocktail party, free from the pressures of competition and excessive media attention. The change in tone can be attributed to both the evolving nature of Britain and the royal family, as well as Harry's position as the second son, allowing him more freedom to deviate from tradition. This wedding was not centered around royal lineage or securing the future of the monarchy but was instead focused on the love and celebration shared between two individuals. The guest list, initially kept secret, unveiled several notable figures, including Oprah Winfrey, whose presence symbolized her status as an American icon transcending race and background. Kate Middleton's parents, Charles Spencer (Diana's brother), and celebrity couples George and Amal Clooney, and David and Victoria Beckham were also in attendance, further adding to the star-studded atmosphere.",paraphrase_generation

Her most notable relationship to date, however, has been with Valderrama, whom she dated from from 2010 to 2016. In an interview with Latina magazine, Lovato discussed what attracted her to the That 70’s Show actor: When I dated white guys, it wasn’t as passionate as my relationship with Wilmer. Maybe that’s just Wilmer. But I do believe that Latin people are just more expressive, more passionate with their emotions. He’s very manly, and he can be stubborn like Latino men can, but he’s protective and he cares so much and loves so hard. I’ve been blessed enough to have him in my life, and not just as my man, but also my best friend. Since her breakup from Valderrama, Lovato’s been seen with MMA fighter Guilherme “Bomba” Vasconcelos and Abedini. 3. Ruby Rose Claims that She & Lovato ‘Hooked Up’ in 2013 In 2013, model and actress Ruby Rose turned heads when she tweeted that she had a lesbian tryst with Lovato. “I’m like the one person demi has slept with that didn’t sell on naked photos of her so eff off,” Rose tweeted out. She went on to say “Think ill take a few days off social media whilst @ddlovato’s friends attack me for being a ‘scorned ex-lover’ get over it! I liked the hair.” Furthermore, a source for Life & Style said that Rose and Lovato dated for two years while the singer took a break from her relationship with Valderrama.

She’s Had Relationships With Several Male Celebrities Lovato, like most notable celebrities, have dated other people in the industry. According to Pop Sugar, she dated The Cab frontman Alex DeLeon from 2008-09, and later based the breakup song “Catch Me” on him.

By the way, love is fluid.” The singer added “Whether there’s been rumours with one specific person or not, that’s all that matters. Humans are humans, and when you connect with somebody on a spiritual level it doesn’t matter. I don’t want people to ever look at the past or rumours or anything and try to figure me out.” 4. She Won the GLAAD Vanguard Award for Promoting LGBTQ Equality While Lovato may be keeping her personal life under wraps, she has made no effort to hide her support for the LGBTQ community. The singer has been so supportive, in fact, that she was given the GLAAD Vanguard Award in 2016, which, according to the GLAAD website, is “presented to media professionals who have made a significant difference in promoting equality and acceptance.” The award was given to her by close friend and former Camp Rock co-star Nick Jonas. “Demi Lovato has consistently used her platform as a successful artist to send messages of acceptance and support to LGBT people everywhere,” said GLAAD President & CEO Sarah Kate Ellis. “She is an extraordinary ally who is committed to helping young people embrace who they are and live the lives they love.” During her acceptance speech, Lovato said “You should always love yourself for who you are,” she said. “The skin that you are in, whether you identify with it and are afraid to tell people, just go for it. You can do it!” Watch the full speech above. 5. She Said She’s Not ‘Denying’ or ‘Confirming’ Her Sexuality Lovato’s 2015 single “Cool for the Summer” had many fans wondering whether or not this was her coy way of speaking on her sexuality.

gossipcop-6803836615,"What do Katy Perry, Meryl Streep, Anderson Cooper and Chelsea Clinton have in common? They have all eaten human flesh at LA’s notorious cannibal restaurant, Cannibal Club.  The private restaurant has long operated under the radar in Los Angeles, with rumors circulating about who has attended and what is really served behind closed doors. Now a leaked Cannibal Club document has exposed some of the notorious restaurant’s “elite” patrons.  CANNIBALISM ‘MORE POPULAR THAN YOU MIGHT THINK’  Meryl Streep, Chelsea Clinton and CNN’s Anderson Cooper all hold Cannibal Club membership, according to the document. Katy Perry, who has previously said that “Cannibalism is way more popular than you might think” and “human flesh is the best meat“, is also a regular diner.  Boasting that the restaurant is the “cutting edge of experimental cuisine” and serves “L.A.’s cultural elite“, the Cannibal Club website makes clear they “specialize in the preparation of human meat” that comes from “young and healthy bodies.“  Cannibal Club’s visiting chefs “hail from around the world” and come to L.A. to “practice their craft free of compromise and unbounded by convention,” according to the Cannibal Club website.  ‘FILMMAKERS, INTELLECTUALS, AND CELEBRITIES’  “Our exclusive clientele includes noted filmmakers, intellectuals, and celebrities who have embraced the Enlightenment ideals of free expression and rationalism. On event nights, avant-garde performance artists, celebrated literary figures, and ground-breaking musicians entertain our guests.  “At Cannibal Club, we celebrate artistic excellence as the natural and inevitable expression of the unbridled human spirit.“  Describing each dish as a “study in taste and elegance“, Chef de Cuisine Sophie Laffite explains: “The meat we serve is selected from the young and healthy. Consistent with the practice of cannibalism in many primitive societies, we view anthropophagy as homage to the dead, who are reborn into the bodies of their consumers.”  But don’t think you can just walk in there and check the place out. The private restaurant operates a strict vetting policy, according to the website:  “It is necessary for us to operate privately and to vette our members in order to avoid disruption from the less enlightened.“  HUMAN MEAT MENU  The current menu listed on the site includes Sirloin Steak (human meat, flame-broiled 8oz), Liver and Mushroom Pirozhi (“a Russian version of pierogies, baked rather than boiled, with a savory filling of wild mushrooms and human liver“) and Placenta Lasagne (“an otherwise traditional lasagna with one layer of cheese substituted by minced placenta in heirloom tomato sauce, seasoned with garlic, onion and oregano”.)  Elspeth Blake, the Cannibal Club proprietor who claims to have earned her stripes working under Vincent Sardi Jr. in New York, did not immediately respond to our questions regarding where the human flesh comes from.  ‘YOUNG AND HEALTHY BODIES’  In the FAQ section of the website, Cannibal Club claims:  “Most of the businesses and institutions who supply us prefer to keep those relationships discreet. On the individual level, bodies are often bequeathed to us. For some, this is a way to supplement life insurance and offset funerary expenses.

They have all eaten human flesh at LA’s notorious cannibal restaurant, Cannibal Club.  The private restaurant has long operated under the radar in Los Angeles, with rumors circulating about who has attended and what is really served behind closed doors. Now a leaked Cannibal Club document has exposed some of the notorious restaurant’s “elite” patrons.  CANNIBALISM ‘MORE POPULAR THAN YOU MIGHT THINK’  Meryl Streep, Chelsea Clinton and CNN’s Anderson Cooper all hold Cannibal Club membership, according to the document. Katy Perry, who has previously said that “Cannibalism is way more popular than you might think” and “human flesh is the best meat“, is also a regular diner.  Boasting that the restaurant is the “cutting edge of experimental cuisine” and serves “L.A.’s cultural elite“, the Cannibal Club website makes clear they “specialize in the preparation of human meat” that comes from “young and healthy bodies.“  Cannibal Club’s visiting chefs “hail from around the world” and come to L.A. to “practice their craft free of compromise and unbounded by convention,” according to the Cannibal Club website.  ‘FILMMAKERS, INTELLECTUALS, AND CELEBRITIES’  “Our exclusive clientele includes noted filmmakers, intellectuals, and celebrities who have embraced the Enlightenment ideals of free expression and rationalism. On event nights, avant-garde performance artists, celebrated literary figures, and ground-breaking musicians entertain our guests.  “At Cannibal Club, we celebrate artistic excellence as the natural and inevitable expression of the unbridled human spirit.“  Describing each dish as a “study in taste and elegance“, Chef de Cuisine Sophie Laffite explains: “The meat we serve is selected from the young and healthy. Consistent with the practice of cannibalism in many primitive societies, we view anthropophagy as homage to the dead, who are reborn into the bodies of their consumers.”  But don’t think you can just walk in there and check the place out. The private restaurant operates a strict vetting policy, according to the website:  “It is necessary for us to operate privately and to vette our members in order to avoid disruption from the less enlightened.“  HUMAN MEAT MENU  The current menu listed on the site includes Sirloin Steak (human meat, flame-broiled 8oz), Liver and Mushroom Pirozhi (“a Russian version of pierogies, baked rather than boiled, with a savory filling of wild mushrooms and human liver“) and Placenta Lasagne (“an otherwise traditional lasagna with one layer of cheese substituted by minced placenta in heirloom tomato sauce, seasoned with garlic, onion and oregano”.)  Elspeth Blake, the Cannibal Club proprietor who claims to have earned her stripes working under Vincent Sardi Jr. in New York, did not immediately respond to our questions regarding where the human flesh comes from.  ‘YOUNG AND HEALTHY BODIES’  In the FAQ section of the website, Cannibal Club claims:  “Most of the businesses and institutions who supply us prefer to keep those relationships discreet. On the individual level, bodies are often bequeathed to us. For some, this is a way to supplement life insurance and offset funerary expenses. For others, such as Cannibal Club member Gwendoline Fenwich, who was served to her friends and relatives at the Club in January of 2008, being prepared as a meal, and thereby reborn into the bodies of the living, is an attractive alternative to the more the traditional practices of burial and cremation.“  The revelation that Hollywood royalty, pop stars and cable TV anchors consume human flesh when they are in Los Angeles is merely the latest example of public figures being exposed as dark figures, reveling in the darkness.

A leaked document from the secretive Cannibal Club in Los Angeles has unveiled some of its high-profile members, including Meryl Streep, Chelsea Clinton, Anderson Cooper, and Katy Perry. Known for its experimental cuisine, the restaurant specializes in serving human meat sourced from young and healthy bodies. Visiting chefs from around the world come to practice their craft free of compromise and convention at the exclusive establishment. Cannibal Club caters to a distinguished clientele consisting of filmmakers, intellectuals, and celebrities who embody ideals such as free expression and rationalism. The website emphasizes the artistic excellence celebrated at the restaurant, with avant-garde performances and esteemed literary figures entertaining guests. Chef de Cuisine Sophie Laffite describes each dish as a study in taste and elegance, highlighting the selection of the meat, which is viewed as a homage to the dead in many primitive societies. The private nature of the restaurant is maintained through a strict vetting policy, ensuring that only enlightened individuals are admitted. The current menu features various dishes prepared with human meat, such as flame-broiled sirloin steak and placenta lasagne. The sources of the human flesh remain discreet, with some bodies being bequeathed to the club by willing individuals. This revelation adds to a growing trend of public figures embracing darkness and pushing boundaries.",paraphrase_generation

They don’t come easily.  But two things happened after the previous review. First, a man who was at the next table wrote to me to say how much he loved Stanley’s. He had no vested interest, but was talking as a well-dined eater about town. Later, I found out that chef and co-owner Stephen McArdle had something more important on his hands than my dinner that night. His son had been born hours before.  If that doesn’t earn a second chance, nothing will. So we’re tucked in at a small table under the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted a soft green. There’s a candle in a wax-crusted wine bottle on the table and high-class jazz standards on the sound system.  For the moment, it feels like we’re not in Dublin. We could be in a city anywhere and lucky enough to find a place we’ll remember fondly when we get home.  The menu is chalked up on the wall and Liam has already ordered some cod croquettes, balls of soft fluffy fish in crispy lagging jackets sitting in a small puddle of silken house mayonnaise.  The star of Stanley’s is Morgan Vanderkamer. She’s the sommelier here. But don’t let that put you off. Bad sommeliers are pretentious up-sellers, there to push diners towards the wallet-busting bruisers on the wine list. Vanderkamer has taken the nonsense out of the role and will open your mind to new ideas about what to drink with your food. If you thought sherry was for fogeys and posers, she will change your mind. So we have ice-cold glasses of manzanilla to cut through the fluffy cod croquettes. We are in excellent hands.  The main event is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. We’re going with an oloroso, the ruby-coloured sherry that gets its colour and kick from time and ageing. There are two on the menu, Vanderkamer says. One is good; the other is “amazing”, and priced accordingly, she warns. With a €16 plate of food between us, we push the sherry cask out and live it large on the oloroso at €13 a glass. It is a good decision.  There’s a small farmyard on that €16 charcuterie plate: generous slices of duck ham, smoked cured slices of moist pink meat. The duck ham is the soulmate of the apricot puree dotted on one side of the plate. The sharp pickled gherkins sing with the “bacon and cabbage”, a slice of ham hock terrine wrapped in crinkly soft leaves of bright-green savoy cabbage. There are two small delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, delicate to the point of dissolving on contact with the tongue. The pear and vanilla sauce, in a small ramekin, takes the sweetness of the liver to another even more decadent place.  Just in case there isn’t enough on the plate (there is), we’ve ordered a plate of the bean and chorizo stew. The beans are in fact chick peas – but that’s even better in my book – and the chorizo has been minced to a small rubble that sits on top of the soupy mix. It’s the kind of stew where the juices have transformed from separate elements of meat, tomato, oil and wine into one glistening sheen. We get a blended Priorat, a Spanish red as heartwarming as the stew, to sip with it.  Dessert would be an option only for people less greedy in their savoury ordering.

Allocating a specific day for romance is as joyful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon. Currently, I am at Stanley's, located on St Andrew's Street in Dublin. This impromptu outing to a different location was prompted by a spontaneous decision of ""Let's go out, but not to our usual place."" I have dined here in the past and enjoyed it, except for the excessively salty fish. Nonetheless, I am giving it a second chance, as they are not easily earned. Two significant incidents occurred after my previous review. Firstly, a man sitting at the adjacent table wrote to inform me of his love for Stanley's. He had no personal interest in the matter but spoke as an experienced frequenter of establishments in town. Additionally, I later discovered that the chef and co-owner, Stephen McArdle, had a significant event on the same night as my previous dinner - the birth of his son. If that does not warrant a second opportunity, then nothing will. Therefore, we find ourselves comfortably seated at a small table beneath the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted in a soft green hue, and a candle in a wax-covered wine bottle adorns the table. The ambiance is complemented by the playing of high-quality jazz standards in the background, momentarily making it feel like we are not in Dublin. It could be any city, and we are fortunate enough to stumble upon a place that will be fondly remembered upon returning home. The menu, conveniently written on the wall, has already enticed Liam to order cod croquettes - delectable balls of tender fish encased in crispy exteriors, accompanied by a luscious house mayonnaise. The star of Stanley's is their sommelier, Morgan Vanderkamer. However, do not let that discourage you. Often, sommeliers can be excessively pretentious and push patrons towards expensive wines on the list. Vanderkamer, however, has eliminated all the nonsense from her role and will guide you towards innovative drink choices to complement your meal. If you previously discredited sherry as outdated or for pretentious individuals, she will change your perspective. Hence, we are served ice-cold glasses of manzanilla to perfectly complement the fluffy cod croquettes, ensuring we are in excellent hands. The highlight of the evening is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. We opt for an oloroso, a ruby-colored sherry that derives its flavor and potency from aging. Vanderkamer highlights that there are two options on the menu, with one being good and the other being ""amazing,"" but priced accordingly. Considering our €16 plate of food between the two of us, we splurge on the €13 per glass oloroso. It proves to be a wise decision. The €16 charcuterie plate resembles a small farm with generous slices of duck ham, moist and pink smoked cured meat. The combination of the duck ham and apricot puree on one side of the plate is soulful. The sharpness of the pickled gherkins pairs beautifully with the ""bacon and cabbage,"" which consists of ham hock terrine wrapped in tender savoy cabbage leaves. Additionally, two delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, almost dissolving upon touching the tongue, adorn the plate. The pear and vanilla sauce, served in a small ramekin, elevates the liver's sweetness to an even more indulgent level. In case the charcuterie plate is not sufficient (it is), we have ordered a plate of bean and chorizo stew. Surprisingly, the beans are actually chickpeas, which proves to be a delightful addition. The chorizo has been artistically minced into a rubble-like texture, adding flavor to the soupy mix. The stew has melded all its components - meat, tomato, oil, and wine - into a glistening sheen, creating a harmonious blend. To complement the stew, we are served a blended Priorat, a heartwarming Spanish red. Dessert is only reserved for those who show restraint in their savory choices. We co",paraphrase_generation

It’s been rumored for weeks that the 41-year-old had plans to purchase Cecil B. DeMille’s historic mansion, and now, she’s bit the bullet, putting down a $25 million offer, according to TMZ. The amount was reportedly accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow.  Cecil’s home, which he lived in until his death in 1959, is considered one of the greatest properties in L.A., and Angie will have some famous neighbors, including Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman and Ellen Pompeo. There’s tons of space for the six kids, too — the house boasts 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, plus a spacious backyard.  This huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53. The possibility of that big move happening seemed even more likely after reports surfaced on April 12 that Angie had met and fallen in love with a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.

The speculation surrounding her potential marriage to a British entrepreneur has not deterred her from establishing permanent roots in California. The lavish Cecil B. DeMille estate is her latest acquisition, offering a glimpse into the stunning mansion through provided photographs. The 41-year-old actress had been rumored to have plans of purchasing this historic property for several weeks and has now followed through by making a $25 million offer, which has been accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow. The property, which was once occupied by Cecil B. DeMille until his passing in 1959, holds significant prestige in LA and will provide Angie with well-known neighbors such as Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman, and Ellen Pompeo. With 6 bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, and a spacious backyard, there is enough space for her six children. This substantial investment comes amidst rumors that Angie intended to relocate her children to London for work purposes following her separation from Brad Pitt in September 2016. These rumors gained traction after reports emerged on April 12 stating that Angie had met a British philanthropist and businessman whom she was deeply in love with, but whose identity remained undisclosed. It is speculated that she plans to marry this mystery man.

gossipcop-4796409702,"Kim Kardashian is allegedly “phasing out” mom Kris Jenner, particularly when it comes to her responsibilities as her longtime manager, amid reports Kim is ready for a total image overhaul after returning to the spotlight following her October robbery.  That’s according to a new report by Radar Online, who’s claiming that the mother-daughter duo could be caught in a nasty feud as a source alleged that Kardashian has had somewhat of an epiphany during her time away from the spotlight and allegedly has now opened her eyes to see how Jenner “used her” to build the Kardashian brand.  According to the site, Kim is ready to project a very different image from the uber-glamorous money flaunting Kardashian fans used to know and is allegedly ready to kick mom Kris to the curb, at least professionally, in order to do so.  A source alleged to the site this week that Kim now “seems to be thinking that Kris used her to get where she is today,” which Radar Online is alleging could have led to a nasty feud between Jenner and her daughter as well as the reality star reportedly making a pretty big business decision when it comes to her mom.  “[Kim] will never think of [Kris] in the same way again,” the source said of Jenner’s supposed drama with her daughter amid reports she believes Jenner has been “using” her for years.  The site then went on to report that Kim is now in the process of projecting her new toned-down image amid the feud claims with Kris, revealing that Jenner may no longer play such a big part in Kardashian’s career going forward.  “Kim hired a transition team to make sure that she gives off a different image than she did previously,” the source said of Jenner and her daughter potentially parting ways professionally, claiming that “part of this process includes phasing out [Kris’s] management.”  While Kris and Kim have not commented on the claims, this isn’t the first time it’s been reported that Kardashian may be looking to distance herself from Jenner, at least professionally, in the wake of her October robbery in Paris.  Radar Online claimed back in October that Kim Kardashian had grown wise to Kris Jenner’s “money making machine” after taking some downtime at the end of 2016, alleging at the time that Kim has been so busy with her career that she’s failed to realize how much Jenner, who is often referred to as her “momager,” had been controlling her life and career.  “Kim never realized how much [Kris] and the money-making machine was controlling her until this robbery,” an insider told the site of Kardashian’s feelings about Jenner at the time, months before it was reported that the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is allegedly looking to “phase out” Kris from her career.  “Kim is just starting to think that maybe Kris’s intentions were not pure all along,” continued the source in October, adding that Kim has been doing a lot of thinking about her father Robert Kardashian while taking some time away which has allegedly helped her to get wise to Kris’s seemingly relentless pursuit of fame for herself and her family.  “[Kim] told her family that she wanted to be the girl that her father wanted her to be and not the girl that she became with Kris’s help,” a source revealed last year, just months before it was reported that a feud could be brewing between Kardashian and Jenner.

After her return to the spotlight following a robbery in October, Kim is said to be ready for a complete image transformation. Radar Online claims that the mother-daughter duo might be involved in a feud as Kim has supposedly realized how Jenner had allegedly used her to build the Kardashian brand. Kim is allegedly ready to project a different, more subdued image, and may be planning to separate professionally from her mom. Reports suggest that Kim now believes Kris used her to achieve her own success, and this alleged drama has strained their relationship. Kim is said to be working on rebranding herself and phasing out Kris's management. Although Kris and Kim have not responded to these claims, this is not the first time it has been suggested that Kim wants to distance herself from her mom, especially after the Paris robbery. It was reported in October that Kim had become aware of Kris's control over her life and career. Kim has been contemplating her relationship with Kris and is striving to be the person her late father would have wanted her to be, rather than the person she became with Kris's influence.

Apparently, the latest news is that the two are through. In Touch Weekly reports that Shelton actually unceremoniously dumped Stefani in February before embarking on a tour.  But wait — if that’s the case, then why is Stefani appearing with him on stage? And not just appearing … they’re appearing pretty cuddly. The singer posted an Instagram shot on Mar. 14 of the two embracing on what appears to be the most recent date of his “Country Music Freaks” trek.      This isn’t the first such picture she has shared since February. She posted several different angles of a jumbotron kiss on Feb. 25, and on March 11, one of herself hanging out with country up-and-comer Carly Pearce, who is an opener on Shelton’s tour, and another that shows off a backstage crowd (including Shelton and her younger brother Todd) in Greensboro, N.C.      Additionally, she sent good wishes to him on Mar. 1 — when Shelton was reportedly attempting to power through a Houston date while sick with the flu — and shared his latest video, “I Lived It” with a glowing string of hashtags.      So if the breakup is fake news, what spurred the rumors? According to In Touch‘s “insider” source, all of Stefani’s social media support is “a desperate attempt to ignore the truth,” and Shelton dumped her due to her “neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband, and her jealousy of him and other women.”  If this is to be believed, current Voice champion Chloe Kohanski was a factor in the breakup — Coach Shelton was apparently getting too close for Stefani’s comfort — as well as Shelton’s ex-wife Miranda Lambert, with whom the outlet claims he has rekindled a friendship and is “sharing intimate details” of his life.  Shelton isn’t reciprocating Stefani’s loving social media deluge — but then again, he’s never been one to do so. His social media accounts, once a source of ribald jokes, have developed gradually into a more businesslike platform to market his music and work on The Voice.

Parton, who has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and been nominated for two Academy Awards, has previously stated that she considers herself an entertainer, and doesn’t believe it is her role to get involved with politics.  At last year’s Emmys, Parton was joined onstage by Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda to present an award. Tomlin and Fonda took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump, but Parton refused to join in, maintaining a dignified silence.","Country singer Dolly Parton believes that California is going through a series of catastrophic events due to their embrace of Satan and rejection of God. Parton predicts that Los Angeles will face a fate similar to the Biblical cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, known for their sinful lifestyle. She claims that California is experiencing disasters as warned in the Bible, including droughts, fires, and mudslides. Parton also mentions the anticipated ""Big One,"" a powerful earthquake expected in the future, which she believes will signify the beginning of the End Times. Additionally, she points out the sexual abuse scandals in Hollywood as another indication of divine punishment. Parton, a renowned entertainer, refuses to engage in politics and prefers to focus on her career.",paraphrase_generation

gossipcop-2682199068,"Reverend Swadley – the local wedding priest and friend of the Pitt family – has confirmed to friends that the A-list couple recently spent a week with Brad’s family, discussing detailed plans for a wedding.  It’s believed the loved-up stars had flown to Missouri because Jen was desperate to reconnect with Brad’s mum, Jane, who she’d developed a very close bond with throughout the time of their first marriage.  During the seven-day visit, it’s been revealed that Jane orchestrated a meeting with the family priest Reverend Swadley – hoping it would be the gentle push Brad and Jen would need to make their reignited relationship official once again.  ‘Reverend Swadley met Jen recently at a family function that Brad’s mum, Jane, threw at their family home in Missouri,’ a close friend of the pastor’s told New Idea exclusively.  ‘Jen accompanied Brad home on the trip and attended church services with the family as well as joining Brad at meetings at the now-retired reverend’s home, who Brad reconnected with after he decided to find himself and renew his faith, following his split from Ange.  ‘He remarked at how at ease Jen was with his family, who clearly adore her, and how everyone said how much she’s been missed and how happy they all were to have her back in Brad’s – and their – lives.’  The source goes on to reveal that Reverend Swadley spoke at length with Brad and Jen about getting married as soon as possible, in Missouri, in a small ceremony, with just local friends and family present.  ‘Reverend Swadley revealed how in love Brad and Jen were and how they planned to officially wed as soon as their divorces were finalised, with him agreeing to conduct the ceremony and welcome them both back into the church,’ the friend of the pastor told New Idea.  Reverend Swadley revealed to our source that it was clear Jen loved seeing Brad’s family again, spending long days talking and laughing for the first time since their 2005 divorce.  ‘Jen spent five days reconnecting with Brad’s parents, brother and sister and many of his childhood friends who he remains close to,’ a friend of the pastor reveals.  Brad Pitt's parents are nothing but supportive Getty  ‘He said Jen kept saying how grateful she was that they’d been brought back together. And how they’ll both be baptised later this year before they officially wed – with Jen’s father, John, vowing to be at her side for the service and give her away again at their wedding, which will hopefully take place shortly after and be far more low-key than their original star-studded nuptials in Malibu.’  It’s the latest chapter in the pair’s rekindled romance since Jen announced her split from estranged husband Justin Theroux in February. She has wasted no time in rebuilding her relationship with ex-husband Brad, spending time with his six children, and developing a unique and special bond with his 11-year-old daughter Shiloh.  It’s that close relationship between Jen and his kids that has prompted Brad to want to marry Jen as soon as soon as possible.  ‘Brad’s mum Jane was all over them to get married as soon as possible, but the truth is Brad needs no convincing,’ says a source close to Brad. ‘They still want to keep this relationship close to their chest and out of the public eye, but behind closed doors they couldn’t be happier.  ‘And for Brad, seeing how much his children – especially Shiloh – love Jen has just made his heart soar.

The purpose of their visit was for Jen to reconnect with Brad's mother, Jane, whom she had formed a close bond with during their previous marriage. During their stay, Jane organized a meeting between the couple and Reverend Swadley, hoping that it would encourage Brad and Jen to formalize their reignited relationship. A friend of the pastor disclosed that Reverend Swadley met Jen at a family event hosted by Jane at their home in Missouri. Throughout the visit, Jen accompanied Brad to church services and attended meetings at the retired reverend's house. Reverend Swadley expressed that Jen fit in comfortably with Brad's family, who greatly cherished her presence and expressed their happiness at her return to their lives. The anonymous source further revealed that Reverend Swadley discussed marriage plans with Brad and Jen, suggesting a small ceremony in Missouri with only close friends and relatives. The pastor also agreed to officiate the wedding and welcome them back into the church once their divorces were finalized. Our insider shared that it was evident to Reverend Swadley that Jen cherished the opportunity to spend time with Brad's family, sharing laughter and conversations like they hadn't since their divorce in 2005. During this visit, Jennifer spent five days reconnecting with Brad's parents, siblings, and childhood friends. Jen repeatedly expressed her gratitude for being reunited with them and mentioned plans for both her and Brad to be baptized before the wedding. Her father, John, promised to be present at the baptism and to walk her down the aisle again, making the occasion more intimate than their previous extravagant wedding in Malibu. This recent development in their rekindled romance follows Jennifer's separation from her estranged husband, Justin Theroux, in February. Jennifer wasted no time building her relationship with Brad, spending time with his six children and forming a strong bond with his 11-year-old daughter, Shiloh. It is this close bond between Jennifer and the children that has led Brad to desire a quick marriage. According to a source close to Brad, his mother has been encouraging them to marry soon, but Brad needs no persuasion as he wants Jennifer to be his wife once again. Although they prefer to keep their relationship private, behind closed doors, they are extremely happy. It is likely that they will get married in Missouri before the end of the year, as Brad and Jen are eager to finalize their divorces and walk down the aisle together.",paraphrase_generation

Stephen King asks PATHETIC question about Obama, gets CLOBBERED by Conservatives  Chelsea Clinton coverage on Twitchy","Megyn shouldn't be too concerned about the National Enquirer, as they have supported absurd claims in the past. Does anyone actually take this publication seriously? It's clear that Trump's allies at the National Enquirer are once again defending him. 
The New York Times and Washington Post are also guilty of biased reporting, but the National Enquirer at least knows that few people believe its stories. Other publications, on the other hand, pretend to be legitimate journalists. 
Chelsea Clinton is trying to bond with Megyn over this issue, but it's not appropriate. It's unlikely that they will become friends because of it. 
Some people are suggesting that the National Enquirer will create false reports about Megyn, including a scandalous lesbian affair. However, she is not a Clinton, so this is unlikely to happen. 
It's interesting to see how some of Chelsea's supporters are being mean to Megyn because of her past support for Trump. They seem to hold a grudge against her. 
Despite all of this, Megyn shouldn't feel sorry for herself. She has made controversial statements in the past and some people don't like her because of it. 
Chelsea may have hoped for a love fest in bonding over the National Enquirer, but her followers are being too mean to Megyn. Clearly, Chelsea didn't anticipate this response, but we did.",paraphrase_generation

Although the explicit word was censored and Colbert's mouth was blurred, journalists managed to uncover the word, printing it with the offensive syllable omitted. Chaos ensued, with Trump labeling Colbert as a ""no-talent guy"" and some condemning Colbert's monologue as vulgar and homophobic. The FCC received numerous complaints and reporters eagerly spread news of an FCC investigation. However, today the FCC has put an end to the controversy by stating that there is no basis for action according to their rules and procedures. The FCC specifies that pre-10 PM TV programs on broadcast stations can be fined if deemed ""indecent,"" while late-night shows have a higher threshold and must be deemed ""obscene"" to face fines. The FCC defines obscene content as material that appeals to prurient interests, depicts or describes sexual conduct in a patently offensive manner, and lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. Provided below is the monologue that sparked the multitude of complaints.",paraphrase_generation

She was looking to settle down sooner than Justin wanted to and she took his reluctance as the last straw to finally move on from him,” our insider adds.  Sel has fans thinking that she still has Bieber on the brain with the release of her new song “Back To You” on May 10. Its her first single in 2018 and her first new music since her make up and break up with Justin. It included lyrics such as “Let a couple years water down how I’m feeling about you” and “Everybody knows we got unfinished business,” which Selenators immediately assumed was about Justin. The chorus went “What was there wasn’t sure. But I’d go back to you. I know I’d go back to you.” Well, she won’t go back Justin unless he’s ready to think about putting a ring on it!  SOURCE: Hollywood life.","Selena Gomez decided to end her relationship with Justin Bieber because he was not ready to commit to a serious future, including marriage. Despite their hopes for a lasting love, both Selena, 25, and Justin, 24, have grown and matured since their teenage romance. Selena wanted Justin to start considering a long-term commitment, but he was not prepared to think about marriage at the same time. A source close to Justin reveals that although he still loves Selena and she still has strong feelings for him, he wasn't ready to settle down when she wanted to. Following a kidney transplant in 2017, Selena's perspective on life changed and she realized that Justin was worth giving another chance. This led to her ending her 10-month relationship with The Weeknd and reuniting with Justin. However, Selena's desire to settle down sooner than Justin caused her to finally move on from him. While fans speculate that Selena's new song ""Back To You"" is about Justin, she won't go back to him unless he's willing to commit to marriage.",paraphrase_generation

She has received an Academy Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards, and has been cited as Hollywood's highest-paid actress. Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin' to Get Out (1982). Her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993), followed by her first leading role in a major film, Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999). Jolie's starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her successful action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014). In the 2010s, Jolie expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), By the Sea (2015), and First They Killed My Father (2017). In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she separated from her third husband, actor Brad Pitt, in September 2016. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally. Early life and family Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[2] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[3] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[4] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[5][6] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[5] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[7] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[5][8] After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[9] Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.[10] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[11] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[12] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[13] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[9] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.

She continued her successful action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress.

As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she separated from her third husband, actor Brad Pitt, in September 2016. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally. Early life and family Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[2] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[3] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[4] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[5][6] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[5] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[7] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[5][8] After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[9] Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.[10] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[11] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[12] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[13] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[9] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions. Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area's affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income. She was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.[11] Her early attempts at modeling, at her mother's insistence, proved unsuccessful.[14][15] She then transferred to Moreno High School, an alternative school, where she became a ""punk outsider,""[14] wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing, and experimenting with knife play with her live-in boyfriend.[11] She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director,[12] taking at-home courses to study embalming.[16] At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies,[9][14] though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation, ""I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk kid with tattoos.""[17] As a teenager, Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she self-harmed,[18] later commenting, ""For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me.""[19] She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder,[16] and began experimenting with drugs; by age 20, she had used ""just about every drug possible,"" particularly heroin.[20] Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicide—at age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her.[12] When she was 24, she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center's psychiatric ward.[12] Two years later, after adopting her first child, Jolie found stability in her life, later stating, ""I knew once I committed to Maddox, I would never be self-destructive again.""[21] Jolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father, which began when Voight left the family when his daughter was less than a year old.[22] She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press.[23] They reconciled when they appeared together in","""Jolie"" refers to Angelina Jolie.

Joe Jonas looks like he’s having a blast on the beach! The 28-year-old was spotted surrounded by a group of bikini-clad women on Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia on Feb. 22 — but none of which were Sophie Turner. Don’t worry, though! The girls were just fans of the DNCE frontman, who graciously posed for photos with them on the sunny shoreline. How sweet!  The “Cake By The Ocean” singer went Down Under to shoot the upcoming season of The Voice Australia, which he will be a celebrity coach on, alongside Delta Goodrem, Kelly Rowland, and Boy George. While his fiancée didn’t make the trip, the couple were able to spend some quality time together before Joe’s excursion to the Southern Hemisphere. Earlier this month, the pair enjoyed a romantic getaway to a private island in the Maldives, and then followed up the vacation with a huge celebration in New York City for Sophie’s 22nd birthday on Feb. 21. Joe’s brother Nick Jonas even commemorated the occasion by giving a sweet shout-out to the birthday girl. He shared a photo from Sophie and Joe’s engagement party in Nov. 2017, and captioned the pic that also included Kevin and Frankie Jonas, “Happy Birthday @sophiet You’re super cool! We all think so!” Aww, it’s like she’s already part of the family!  You can also bet that the Game Of Thrones star wouldn’t mind her fiancé posing for photos with a bunch of beauties on the beach. On her birthday, Sophie posted a video to her Instagram story jamming out to “22” by Taylor Swift (as any self-respecting 22-year-old would do on their birthday). As you may remember, Tay and Joe used to be a ~thing~ back in 2008. But clearly, that doesn’t phase the X-Men: Apocalypse star in the slightest — nor should it.

gossipcop-5077951266,"The royal wedding is a multi-million dollar affair. Chris Jackson / Getty  The average cost of a wedding for couples in the US and the UK is around $34,000 (£23,700).  Five figures is a huge expense for a one-day affair. That is, unless you're ultra-rich — and especially if you're royalty rich.  Next month, the world will bear witness to the most anticipated royal wedding in years. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to be married on May 19 at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor, and will begin a carriage procession immediately after the ceremony. Their reception will take place later on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding, an expense traditionally taken on by the bride's family.  The case was the same for Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 royal wedding— the only item Middleton paid for was her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress. Their total wedding celebration cost $34 million (£23.7 million).  Markle and Prince Harry's wedding will reportedly cost in excess of $45.8 million (£32 million), according to Bride Book's estimation. That's over 1,000 more than the average wedding.  The venue is the biggest part of a typical wedding budget for couples in the US and the UK, taking up nearly half of the entire wedding cost. Access to St. George's Chapel — and St. George's Great Hall, where the wedding reception will take place — is free of charge for Markle and Prince Harry. Transportation is also free, thanks to the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys.  The greatest cost for the royal couple? Security. Protecting Markle and Prince Harry, plus thousands of guests and onlookers, will run Kensington Palace a whopping $43 million (£30 million), estimates Bride Book. That includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones. The bulk of Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding budget similarly went to security costs.  Otherwise, Markle and Prince Harry's total wedding spend, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to about $2.8 million.

The pair weren’t seen together much during the summer, though it was later revealed the singer-actress was laying low due to a kidney transplant. Regardless, they still appeared to be going strong in the early fall. Prior to the announcement of their breakup, the status of their relationship was questioned after it emerged Gomez had rekindled her friendship with Bieber. © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  On Sunday, that speculation swirled as Bieber and Gomez were seen in public and The Weeknd stopped following her friends on social media. That being said, Bieber was allegedly not responsible for the breakup. Rather, it was the challenges of a long-distance relationship, particularly with The Weeknd touring and Gomez’s shooting schedule, that led both the former couple to reconsider their fizzling relationship.  Additionally, contributing to their split, the rapper felt “tied down” in a relationship that had lost its spark. Over time, the pair started talking less frequently on the phone, prompting The Weeknd to end his romance with Gomez, reports TMZ. Despite their breakup, we’re told that the pair are still on good terms and have talked several times since the split.  Predictably, after the rapper ended his relationship with Gomez, Gossip Cop busted the often disproven HollywoodLife for claiming in a made-up report that The Weeknd was “heartbroken” over Gomez reconnecting with Bieber.

Multiple sources are suggesting that a high-profile divorce worth $400 million is likely to unfold. The National ENQUIRER has received exclusive information that Ellen has vacated their shared love nest and agreed to sell the estate they purchased together just eight months ago, in a transaction that will not be publicly listed. An insider claims that Ellen made extensive efforts to keep the news from their close friends to avoid inquiries, and that their arguments have become increasingly frequent and escalated into something more hostile than usual. Despite her public claims that their marriage is strong, sources have revealed that Ellen and Portia have been spending nights alone and now appear to be living apart. Property records indicate that Ellen and Portia have maintained separate residences on their six-acre equestrian estate in Montecito, California, which recently sold for $11 million. Furthermore, after acquiring the sprawling property for $7.2 million in September, Ellen discreetly purchased a place of her own in Carpinteria, located nine miles away. Sources suggest that Ellen's recent real estate purchases are not solely financially motivated, but rather reflect her desire to have separate residences as she and Portia move closer towards an official separation. One source states that they spend less and less time together, barely speaking throughout the day. Another insider reveals that Portia feels neglected and mistreated, claiming that she supports Ellen in all aspects of her life while Ellen becomes agitated and judgmental regarding Portia's needs. If the couple does announce a divorce, experts predict it will become one of the most costly divorces in Hollywood history, given their combined wealth, future earnings, and property assets valued at $400 million. A recent photograph of Ellen showed her without her wedding ring during a shopping trip in Beverly Hills, sparking rumors of marital strain. However, in subsequent days, the couple appeared together in public, putting on a show of their ""happy"" marriage, yet insiders remain unconvinced, citing a lack of intimacy between them. While a friend of Ellen's dismisses talk of divorce, sources claim that their marriage has experienced numerous explosive episodes in the past. Concerns grow as Portia spends increasing amounts of time alone in her separate residence in Beverly Hills. The insider states that it is typically Portia who leaves when they argue, describing Ellen as dull and going to bed early every night. Additionally, Portia has allegedly complained that Ellen prioritizes their pets over her.",paraphrase_generation

Also, after all these years of being a decathlete and going through dieting for years, the 67 year old Jenner might not want to do it anymore. “So let it be!” is what she might have been thinking. Also, the other reason maybe her daughter Kim’s cellulite pictures that surfaced online. This might just be a way to support her daughter.  Rumors or truth  This is not the only time some issues or sites posted a rumor about Caitlyn Jenner. Just last year, a issue of National Enquirer said that Jenner “wants her BIG, clunky-feet reduced to more lady-like proportions.” Again, this just a few days ago, radar online was on about exploring her sexuality online and enjoying a number of secret ‘cyber hookups’. The transgender star, Jenner has had gender reassignment surgery as well as she said she was never interested in men. There are many rumors which may include some truth about Jenner.  Short Bio on Caitlyn Jenner  Caitlyn Jenner is a decathlete turned TV personality. She is known by her previous name “Bruce Jenner”. The Olympic gold medal winner came out as a transgender in April 2015. She is the celebrity from the reality show “Keeping Up with Kardashians” along with her daughters. She has undergone a knee surgery before which she was a college football player for the Graceland Yellowjackets. More Bio…","Caitlyn Jenner, a TV personality and former Olympic champion, is experiencing a unique sense of femininity through her cellulite. She has expressed joy and a desire to show off her cellulite in a bikini this summer. This unconventional perspective has sparked curiosity and debate, as many people typically try to hide their cellulite. The article also refers to Jenner as a ""blabbermouth"" due to her excessive talking. However, it is suggested that Jenner may be embracing her body and viewing her cellulite as a natural aspect of womanhood. Despite the controversy, some believe that Jenner's outlook may resonate with others who also have cellulite. The article further speculates that Jenner's decision to show off her cellulite may be a response to her daughter Kim's own cellulite pictures that surfaced online. Overall, while rumors about Jenner have circulated in the past, this particular topic sheds light on her unique perspective and journey as a transgender individual.",paraphrase_generation

'She was a nervous wreck about conceiving,' a palace insider says, not only because of her age but 'because it didn't happen with her first husband,' producer Trevor Engelson, from whom she split in 2013 after two years of marriage and nine years as a couple.  In Touch  The pressure to give husband, Prince Harry, children 'felt like a huge weight on Meghan's shoulders,' says the source.  'Everyone expected her to get pregnant immediately.'  Meanwhile Prince William, 36, was 'initially shocked when Kate told him he's going to be a dad again', but now he sees it as a 'happy surprise.'  'He and Kate have always wanted four kids,' the source tells.  And this time around, adds the source, Kate gets to share her pregnancy journey with not only her young sister Pippa, 34, who is due with her first child in a few months, but her new sister-in-law, too.

Fitness enthusiast Meghan, whose mother Doria Ragland is a yoga instructor, is returning the favour by teaching Kate pregnancy yoga.  The publication adds that the two pregnant women are happily letting their husbands dote on them.  'William is doing his best to help Kate relax by being a hands-on father to George, Louis and Charlotte,' says the source.  'He brings Kate tea and cookies in bed,' including lavender biscuits which are known to help with nausea.  Getty  Kate, adds the source, is 'convinced she's having another girl because she's having the same cravings for sweets that she did when she was pregnant with Charlotte.'  Meghan is hoping for one of each - a boy and a girl - the insider tells In Touch.  'This is a dream come true for both couples.'  The royal family is yet to respond to In Touch's report.  The latest edition of New Idea Royals explores what REALLY happened at Prince Louis' royal christening.","According to a bombshell report, both duchesses, who are 36 years old, are planning to raise their royal cousins and form a united and happy family. A source reveals that Kate and Meghan have bonded over their husbands and now they are bonding over being pregnant at the same time. The news of their pregnancies has caused a lot of buzz in the palace, but only close family and friends have been informed, according to In Touch. For Meghan, the pregnancy is not just a joyful occasion but also a huge relief. She had been worried about conceiving, partly because of her age and also because she was unable to conceive with her first husband, Trevor Engelson. The pressure to have children felt like a heavy burden on Meghan, as everyone expected her to get pregnant immediately. On the other hand, Prince William was initially shocked to hear that Kate is expecting again, but he now sees it as a happy surprise. The source reveals that William and Kate had always wanted four children, and this time, Kate will be able to share her pregnancy journey with her sister Pippa and her new sister-in-law Meghan. The two duchesses are reportedly enjoying sharing this experience together. Kate is advising Meghan on healthy eating during pregnancy and how to balance motherhood with royal life, while Meghan is teaching Kate pregnancy yoga. The publication also mentions that both husbands are being doting and supportive, with William taking care of Kate and bringing her tea and cookies in bed. Both duchesses have their own hopes for the baby's gender, with Kate believing she is having a girl due to her cravings for sweets like she had during her pregnancy with Charlotte, while Meghan is hoping for one of each - a boy and a girl. This situation is a dream come true for both couples, as per the insider. The royal family has not yet responded to the report from In Touch.",paraphrase_generation

gossipcop-3308884181,"Beyoncé Rumored To Be Asking For Silent Delivery  As the countdown to Blueprint 1 and Blueprint 2’s arrival continues, the stories about Bey’s birth plans abound. First, we heard she planned to give birth at home, then they said her security has been running weekly drills to practice their approach to Cedars-Sinai and now there’s a report that Bey wants silence in the delivery room.  According to Naughty Gossip reports:  “Beyoncé likes peace and calm around her. She has zero time for drama and gossip. She likes her inner circle to be soft spoken if they have to talk at all. And you can expect the same will be true when she gives birth to the twins,” sources tell Straight Shuter. “You can only get into her private life if you are invited. She is very guarded and protects her privacy at all cost. She likes to be surrounded with peaceful colors and soft sounds. This will be of utmost importance for her when giving birth.”  This story is almost like opening up a fortune cookie or visiting your average storefront psychic. EVERYBODY knows Beyoncé is private. THAT doesn’t take an exclusive source to figure out.  Silent birth is a real thing though – something that Scientologists practice and Katie Holmes even did when she gave birth to Suri, but as much as Bey loves music we don’t really see her doing a silent birth.

GettyImages/Instagram","Reports suggest that Beyoncé is rumored to be requesting a silent delivery for the arrival of her twins. The singer, known for her desire for peace and privacy, wants a calm and drama-free environment during childbirth. Beyoncé values her inner circle being soft-spoken and prefers a serene atmosphere. This is consistent with her protective nature, as she only allows those she invites into her private life. It is important to her to be surrounded by peaceful colors and gentle sounds during the birth. While it is well-known that Beyoncé is a private person, the idea of a silent birth is reminiscent of the practice followed by Scientologists and even Katie Holmes when she gave birth to her daughter, Suri.

The former Real Housewife of New York, ran around the grounds in an A-line Carolina Herrera dress, posing on the step-and-repeat, taking photos with fans, and catching up with old friends. Trying to track her down for an interview turned into a scavenger hunt.  Scattered around the lawn were tables for vendors selling everything from wine to sex toys. There was a station for guests to get a vitamin infusion, with seats in the direct line of the sun transforming the spot into an inescapable sauna-I.V. drip hybrid. Housewives from across the country flew into town for the occasion (Vicki Gunvalson of Orange County and LeeAnne Locken of Dallas), which also served as a benefit for Thyroid Cancer Research in honor of Zarin’s late husband, Bobby, who died of the disease in January.  Upon first try to flag Zarin down for a couple of questions, she sent over her daughter, Ally Shapiro, in her stead. Shapiro reflected on last year’s luncheon, when her stepfather was still struggling with cancer, but encouraged her and her mother to party on.  “He loved drinking and partying. This was the highlight of his year,” she said. “It was this time last year that we were told he wasn’t gonna make it another week, and he pushed us and he said, ‘Go to the party. Maybe I won’t be here when you come back, but go.’”  Shapiro, who now lives in London while she works on her master’s degree, admits that she can’t watch old episodes of Real Housewives, which showed her as 14-year-old struggling to get close to her stepfather. “You want to think that it’s like a home movie, but it’s not. That’s not what our relationship was like,” she said, adding that the reruns play constantly in the U.K. “I’m walking down the street and someone’s like, ‘Oh my God, I just saw you trying on a prom dress!’”  She also said that her mother is dabbling with dating, specifically with a man she plays tennis with. “It’s fun, and I live in London so it’s good for her to have a distraction.”  Dina Lohan, dressed in a metallic green blazer and shorts set and a pair of oversized aviators, arrived fashionably late to the affair, but was immediately greeted by hoards of people trying to chat her up or get a photo. Eventually secured in the same spot for more than a few seconds, she was willing to talk about her daughter Lindsay’s upcoming project for MTV, a Vanderpump Rules–inspired reality show that follows Lindsay and the employees of her new Lohan Beach Club. Bunim/Murray Productions is producing the series, the same company that produced Lohan’s E! reality show Living Lohan a decade ago.  “These kids were like, babies, and now they’re running the show,” she said of the crew. “They lived in my house! And now they’re all corporate. . . . We’re home. It’s cyclical, you know.”  Lohan also revealed that the upcoming series is a bit of a family affair with Lindsay’s younger sister, 24-year-old Ali, providing the theme song.  A friend of Lohan’s interjected, asking if Ali, like her older sister over a decade ago, had moved out to L.A. for work.  “She’s in New York with me,” the matriarch answered. “I keep them close! I’m not going to lose someone to L.A., no. Not again!”  Finally, the woman of the hour managed to stop and take a breath.

Trying to get an interview with her turned into a scavenger hunt as she was constantly on the move. Throughout the event, there were various vendors selling products, including wine and sex toys.

She mentioned that despite the difficult circumstances, he encouraged them to enjoy the event. Ally, who now lives in London, admitted that she finds it challenging to watch old episodes of Real Housewives due to the portrayal of her struggling to connect with her stepfather. She shared how strangers in the UK recognize her from the show.

The 20-year-old cosmetics guru — who is expecting her first child, a baby girl, with boyfriend Travis Scott — did not appear in any photos from the bash shared to social media by KarJenner family members. But a source tells PEOPLE she was there celebrating away from the cameras.  “Kylie looked great but didn’t really draw any attention to her baby bump,” the source says. “She still acts like she wants to keep her pregnancy private.”  Meanwhile, her sister Khloé Kardashian, — who earlier this week confirmed that she and boyfriend Tristan Thompson are expecting their first child together — accentuated her own baby bump in a skin-tight, sparkly jumpsuit with a white fur coat.  “Khloé was beaming all night,” the insider says of the 33-year-old Revenge Body host. “She kept touching and showing off her cute baby belly.”  Khloé showed off her bump on Instagram as well.  “Merry Christmas!! May you sparkle and shine this festive season, may all of your wishes and dreams come true,” Khloé captioned a gallery of shots showing her touching her belly. “I pray that we all may feel this happiness all year round. God bless you! ✨ #BabyBump🤗”  “Merry Christmas!!!!!

Kourtney’s ex-boyfriend Scott Disick was there, too — without girlfriend Sofia Richie.  “He mingled, looked good and didn’t drink,” the source says, adding that there wasn’t any awkwardness with Kourtney’s new boyfriend Younes Bendjima.  “Kourtney seemed so happy that Younes joined her,” the insider says. “They are so cute together. He kept bringing her drinks and doting on her. Younes fits right into the family. He didn’t seem uncomfortable that Scott was there. They said hello, but that was it. It was very civil.”  Other guests included Kim’s husband Kanye West, celebrity hair stylists Jen Atkin and Chris Appleton, singer Christina Aguilera and Keeping Up with the Kardashians executive producer Ryan Seacrest. Kris appeared to be in a good mood throughout the night, dancing with Kim and Khloé and playing MC while Babyface, Toni Braxton and Brian McKnight performed.  “Everyone had the most amazing time,” the source tells PEOPLE. “Kris always throws the best parties.

But a source tells PEOPLE she was there celebrating away from the cameras.  “Kylie looked great but didn’t really draw any attention to her baby bump,” the source says. “She still acts like she wants to keep her pregnancy private.”  Meanwhile, her sister Khloé Kardashian, — who earlier this week confirmed that she and boyfriend Tristan Thompson are expecting their first child together — accentuated her own baby bump in a skin-tight, sparkly jumpsuit with a white fur coat.  “Khloé was beaming all night,” the insider says of the 33-year-old Revenge Body host. “She kept touching and showing off her cute baby belly.”  Khloé showed off her bump on Instagram as well.  “Merry Christmas!! May you sparkle and shine this festive season, may all of your wishes and dreams come true,” Khloé captioned a gallery of shots showing her touching her belly. “I pray that we all may feel this happiness all year round. God bless you! ✨ #BabyBump🤗”  “Merry Christmas!!!!! Wishing all of you and your families much Joy Happiness Peace and Health…” Kris added in her own post, a photo of her and Khloé alongside Kendall Jenner. “Love you guys!!!!!!!! #christmas #blessed #ohholynight.”  Kim Kardashian West, Kris Jenner and Khloé Kardashian Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  Khloé Kardashian and Scott Disic Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  Aside for Khloé and Kendall, Kris’ party also brought together siblings Kim Kardashian West (who’s expecting her third child, via a surrogate), Kourtney Kardashian, and their kids: Kim’s daughter North, 4, and son Saint, 2; and Kourtney son Reign, 3, daughter Penelope, 5, and son Mason, 8.  Kourtney’s ex-boyfriend Scott Disick was there, too — without girlfriend Sofia Richie.  “He mingled, looked good and didn’t drink,” the source says, adding that there wasn’t any awkwardness with Kourtney’s new boyfriend Younes Bendjima.  “Kourtney seemed so happy that Younes joined her,” the insider says. “They are so cute together. He kept bringing her drinks and doting on her. Younes fits right into the family. He didn’t seem uncomfortable that Scott was there. They said hello, but that was it. It was very civil.”  Other guests included Kim’s husband Kanye West, celebrity hair stylists Jen Atkin and Chris Appleton, singer Christina Aguilera and Keeping Up with the Kardashians executive producer Ryan Seacrest. Kris appeared to be in a good mood throughout the night, dancing with Kim and Khloé and playing MC while Babyface, Toni Braxton and Brian McKnight performed.  “Everyone had the most amazing time,” the source tells PEOPLE. “Kris always throws the best parties. It was all gorgeous. There was no drama.”  Rob Kardashian and Khloé Kardashian Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  Kylie Jenner and Khloé Kardashian Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  On Christmas morning, the family gathered at Kourtney’s house to open presents and celebrate the holiday in matching elf-patterned onesies and beanies.  “Merry Christmas! People think you weren’t there last night,” Khloé said to Kylie, 20, in one Snapchat video as the younger sister replied: “I was.”  “She’s a secret little bunny,” Khloé teased.

On the other hand, Khloé Kardashian proudly showcased her baby bump at the party and on Instagram. The party also brought together other family members, including Kim Kardashian West, Kourtney Kardashian, and their children, as well as Kourtney's ex-boyfriend Scott Disick. There was no tension between Scott and Kourtney's new boyfriend, Younes Bendjima. The party was a success, with Kris Jenner dancing and playing the MC while Babyface, Toni Braxton, and Brian McKnight performed. The following morning, the family celebrated Christmas together at Kourtney's house.

On Khloe's blog in June 2010, she shared a number of pictures of her and the attorney.  She wrote: 'Father’s Day is two days away, so in preparation I wanted to post this photo album (mostly old school pics) dedicated to my dad and to Bruce.  'I was seriously the luckiest girl in the world growing up because I had two amazing dads who not only loved us kids more than anything, but adored each other as well.  'My dad and Bruce were always really cl","Khloe Kardashian, the youngest sister of the Kardashian family, is facing allegations from two of her father's ex-wives who claim that he expressed doubts about her paternity. The ex-wives, Jan Ashley and Ellen Pierson, say that Robert Kardashian confided in them that Khloe was not his child. Khloe has responded to these claims on Twitter, calling them ""disgusting"" and ""low"". Kim Kardashian and her family have been surrounded by drama as a result of these allegations. Ashley and Pierson have both come forward to share their side of the story after years of silence. Ashley stated that Robert told her Khloe was not his child shortly after they got married. Pierson also claims that Robert expressed uncertainty about Khloe's paternity. Khloe, who is married to Lamar Odom, has reportedly known about this for a long time and frequently brought it up. She has pointed out that she looks different from her sisters and Rob Kardashian. Both Ashley and Pierson suggest that Robert and Kris were not sleeping together at the time Khloe was conceived. However, they state that Robert never considered a DNA test because he loved Khloe very much. Khloe has strongly rejected these claims on Twitter. Kris recently admitted to cheating on Robert during their marriage. After Robert's death, Ellen faced financial difficulties and filed for bankruptcy. The home she shared with Robert was sold due to foreclosure. Kris went on to marry Bruce Jenner and they had two daughters together. Khloe has always acknowledged that she looks different from her sisters, and Kris has mentioned in the past that people questioned whether Khloe was the milkman's daughter when she was born. Khloe has previously shared pictures and memories of her relationship with her father on her blog. She emphasizes that she was lucky to have had two loving dads in her life.",paraphrase_generation

gossipcop-5865271192,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.

However, Holmes discovered that Foxx was not ready to give up his flirtatious behavior and his connection with his ex-girlfriend Kristin Grannis. This led Holmes to call off the wedding and end their relationship. At the same time, Tom Cruise has been trying to reconnect with their daughter Suri, whom he hasn't seen for more than five years due to the restrictions imposed by his involvement with the Church of Scientology.

(Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images)  Here are a selection of headlines People.com has posted over the past few days:  Pregnant Kylie Jenner Wants an ‘Easy Birth’, Says Source: She’s ‘Open to Pain Medicine’  Pregnant Kylie Jenner ‘Hasn’t Hired a Nanny’: She’s ‘Worried About New People Around the Baby’  Pregnant Kylie Jenner Has a Baby Name Picked Out for Her Daughter  Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Yet — Kylie Jenner, 20, has not actually confirmed she is pregnant.  For some celebrities, this would not be a big deal — some stars get pregnant and do not say a word, even as “sources” and “insiders” dish to the tabloids, as illustrated above. For someone in the Kardashian-Jenner family, this is especially confusing.  After all, these family members have become international superstars because they share nearly every detail of their lives, even the painful or uncomfortable moments. As a result, people have become inexplicably fascinated by all of them (Kris Jenner, Caitlyn Jenner, Kim Kardashian West, Kourtney Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Rob Kardashian), which has fueled their multimillion-dollar franchise of reality shows and sponsorships.  So the decision to keep Kylie’s apparent pregnancy under wraps is very off-brand for the family. This month, speculation will probably hit even more of a fever pitch, as February is the oft-reported due date for her baby, reportedly a girl.  The non-confirmation of the news — reported by the tabloids in September and described as a “happy” surprise for Kylie and her boyfriend, rapper Travis Scott — has sent some fans into a spiral. On Christmas Day, fans melted down when Kylie did not appear on the family’s annual Christmas card. Starting Dec. 1, Kim released a new part of the photo every day, and many expected Kylie’s announcement to be included in the final photo shoot. No dice.  [Kylie Jenner still hasn’t confirmed her pregnancy. On Christmas, fans melted down on social media.]  Meanwhile, people keep searching for information. TMZ posted blurry footage of Kylie’s first public appearance since the fall, although she’s wearing baggy clothes.

Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Yet — Kylie Jenner, 20, has not actually confirmed she is pregnant.  For some celebrities, this would not be a big deal — some stars get pregnant and do not say a word, even as “sources” and “insiders” dish to the tabloids, as illustrated above. For someone in the Kardashian-Jenner family, this is especially confusing.  After all, these family members have become international superstars because they share nearly every detail of their lives, even the painful or uncomfortable moments. As a result, people have become inexplicably fascinated by all of them (Kris Jenner, Caitlyn Jenner, Kim Kardashian West, Kourtney Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Rob Kardashian), which has fueled their multimillion-dollar franchise of reality shows and sponsorships.  So the decision to keep Kylie’s apparent pregnancy under wraps is very off-brand for the family. This month, speculation will probably hit even more of a fever pitch, as February is the oft-reported due date for her baby, reportedly a girl.  The non-confirmation of the news — reported by the tabloids in September and described as a “happy” surprise for Kylie and her boyfriend, rapper Travis Scott — has sent some fans into a spiral. On Christmas Day, fans melted down when Kylie did not appear on the family’s annual Christmas card. Starting Dec. 1, Kim released a new part of the photo every day, and many expected Kylie’s announcement to be included in the final photo shoot. No dice.  [Kylie Jenner still hasn’t confirmed her pregnancy. On Christmas, fans melted down on social media.]  Meanwhile, people keep searching for information. TMZ posted blurry footage of Kylie’s first public appearance since the fall, although she’s wearing baggy clothes.

Despite the ongoing speculation and tabloid reports, Kylie Jenner, who is rumored to be pregnant, has not yet confirmed the news. While other celebrities choose to keep such personal matters private, it is surprising for a member of the Kardashian-Jenner family, who are known for sharing intimate details of their lives. The lack of confirmation has led fans to become even more curious, especially since February is rumored to be the expected due date for her baby girl. Kylie's absence from the family's annual Christmas card further fueled speculation. Although there is no official confirmation, TMZ recently released blurry footage of Kylie's first public appearance since the pregnancy rumors began, while rumors suggest that the announcement might come in the season finale of ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians."" If Kylie's baby does arrive this month, it will join cousins Chicago West and Khloe Kardashian's upcoming baby.

Magazine is reporting that the ""Wildest Dreams"" singer has been contacting her ex ever since he has been in New York City starring in the Broadway show called Sunday in the Park With George.  The tabloid is reporting that a source is saying that Taylor is the one reaching out to the actor since she feels she is now more mature than she was when they dated back in 2010.  The source said, “Taylor was so young when they dated, she wasn’t ready for a serious relationship, but now she’s showing Jake how much she’s matured. She’s excited to see where things go.”  In 2015, a rumor swirled around saying that the stars were in contact with each other, even though she was dating Calvin Harris at the time.  An unidentified source told Star magazine that, “He said he owed Taylor an apology for how things ended between them. In June, Jake ran into Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show and asked for Taylor’s new number. They’ve kept in touch, albeit secretly, ever since.""  This would all be so ironic since Taylor allegedly wrote the hit song ""We Are Never Getting Back Together"" from her Red album about the relationship after her ex's friend asked her if they were giving their relationship a second chance.  “This guy walks in who is a friend of my ex’s and starts talking about how he’s heard we’re going to get back together. And that was not the case. So I start telling them the story: break up, get back together, break-up, get back together — just, ugh, the worst! And I picked up the guitar and (songwriting partner Max Martin) said, ‘This is what we’re writing,’” she once revealed to GMA.  The lyrics in the track said: ""I'm really gonna miss you picking fights / And me falling for it screaming that I'm right / And you would hide away and find your peace of mind / With some indie record that's much cooler than mine.""  In the video for the song, the actor who plays the singer's love interest gives her a scarf which many thought to be a clue that revealed the song was about Jake since she had been photographed wearing one of his scarfs while they were dating.  Since Taylor is now single and so is Jake and they both happen to be living in the same city, we don't see how this could be a problem. There is no confirmation that this is actually happening though and a source close to them told Gossip Cop that there was ""no truth"" to the report.

She’s excited to see where things go.”  In 2015, a rumor swirled around saying that the stars were in contact with each other, even though she was dating Calvin Harris at the time.  An unidentified source told Star magazine that, “He said he owed Taylor an apology for how things ended between them. In June, Jake ran into Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show and asked for Taylor’s new number. They’ve kept in touch, albeit secretly, ever since.""  This would all be so ironic since Taylor allegedly wrote the hit song ""We Are Never Getting Back Together"" from her Red album about the relationship after her ex's friend asked her if they were giving their relationship a second chance.  “This guy walks in who is a friend of my ex’s and starts talking about how he’s heard we’re going to get back together. And that was not the case. So I start telling them the story: break up, get back together, break-up, get back together — just, ugh, the worst! And I picked up the guitar and (songwriting partner Max Martin) said, ‘This is what we’re writing,’” she once revealed to GMA.  The lyrics in the track said: ""I'm really gonna miss you picking fights / And me falling for it screaming that I'm right / And you would hide away and find your peace of mind / With some indie record that's much cooler than mine.""  In the video for the song, the actor who plays the singer's love interest gives her a scarf which many thought to be a clue that revealed the song was about Jake since she had been photographed wearing one of his scarfs while they were dating.  Since Taylor is now single and so is Jake and they both happen to be living in the same city, we don't see how this could be a problem. There is no confirmation that this is actually happening though and a source close to them told Gossip Cop that there was ""no truth"" to the report.  Do you think Taylor should get back together with Jake? Tell us in the comments.","According to OK! Magazine, there have been reports suggesting that Taylor Swift is attempting to rekindle her past relationship with Jake Gyllenhaal. The tabloid claims that the singer has been reaching out to her ex ever since he started his Broadway show in New York City called Sunday in the Park With George. It is believed that Taylor, feeling more mature now than when they dated in 2010, is the one initiating contact with the actor. A source shared that Taylor was too young back then for a serious relationship, but now she wants to demonstrate her growth to Jake. While in a relationship with Calvin Harris in 2015, there were rumors that Taylor and Jake stayed in touch. An unidentified source revealed that Jake wanted to apologize to Taylor for the way things ended between them and got her new number through Cara Delevingne. Despite this, it would be ironic if they were to get back together, as Taylor's hit song ""We Are Never Getting Back Together"" from her Red album is believed to be about their relationship. In the song, she sings about their fights, Jake finding solace in indie music, and a scarf gifted to her by her love interest in the music video, reminiscent of one she wore during their time together. Both Taylor and Jake are currently single and living in the same city, making it seemingly feasible for them to reconnect. However, there is no confirmation of this happening, and a close source dismissed the rumors. Do you think Taylor and Jake should reconcile?

She’s tried to hang in there, but she just can’t take it anymore.”  Poor Kim! We can’t imagine how hard it must be to have a family member — especially your husband — go through such a huge health scare. Of course she’s stressed!

Being two of the biggest young stars of their time, their relationship has garnered a wide range of admirers, from supportive to completely obsessed. Tracking their on-again, off-again relationship has been quite challenging, but luckily, we've broken down every single breakup and makeup they've had.

They made their red carpet debut as a couple in February 2011 at the Vanity Fair Oscars party. The young lovebirds looked happy and in love at the Billboard Music Awards in May 2011. In November 2011, rumors of their breakup circulate after a Bieber fan claims that she had sex with him backstage at a show and that he is the father of her child. However, these rumors are proven false. The couple officially breaks up in November 2012, supposedly due to their busy schedules. Bieber is briefly linked to model Barbara Palvin during this time. In January 2013, they reportedly get back together, with Gomez traveling to Norway to visit Bieber. Gomez confirms in November 2014 that her song, ""The Heart Wants What It Wants,"" is about Bieber, and they confirm their official split. Bieber denies dating rumors with Hailey Baldwin in December 2014, stating that they are just good friends. Shortly after, rumors of Gomez dating DJ Zedd surface in January 2015 and are confirmed later that year. Gomez opens up about her past relationship with Bieber in an interview with ELLE in September 2015. Bieber reveals on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in November 2015 that several songs on his album are inspired by Selena. Bieber and Baldwin have a public romance on Instagram in January 2016 but break up soon after. Bieber is then seen with Sofia Richie, which sparks outrage from Jelena fans.

gossipcop-2388806885,"R. Kelly’s time may have finally come. R. Kelly has been accused of sexual relationships with minors going back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah. (The marriage was annulled.) In the 24 years since then, he has been sued multiple times for inappropriate sexual contact with a minor (he settled out of court every time), and he was eventually charged with creating child pornography. (A jury found him not guilty on the grounds that they could not conclusively identify the other figure in his infamous sex tape as a child.) Last summer, he was accused of creating an abusive “sex cult” of very young women, whom he allegedly isolates, brainwashes, and abuses physically and emotionally. Since the story broke, multiple women have added their own testimonies of abuse at R. Kelly’s hands. (Through a lawyer, Kelly denied all accusations, saying he would “work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.”) And in April, another woman accused Kelly of “knowingly and intentionally infecting her with an STD.” Her lawyers say they are currently preparing a federal civil lawsuit. Through a spokesperson, Kelly issued a statement to the Washington Post in which he “categorically denies all claims and allegations.” As man after man has fallen to the #MeToo reckoning, losing jobs and retiring from public life after being accused of sexual harassment and assault, there’s been a recurring whisper: What about R. Kelly? Despite decades of lawsuits and allegations, Kelly’s career has marched steadily on. Last year, he finished an arena tour with a few cancellations. This year, he’s touring with singer Charlie Wilson (some protests are planned). His music appeared in Pitch Perfect 3. At this year’s Coachella, rapper Vince Staples repeatedly referred to Kelly as a “child molester” in an interview with Complex, insisting, “He pees on people.” In our post-#MeToo, post-Time’s Up, post-Harvey Weinstein world, and given the sheer volume of allegations against Kelly, it seems reasonable to raise the question of why he continues to work as much as he does. But Staples’s interviewer only giggled nervously and protested, “We can’t ever talk about this guy. ... You’re about to get me fired from Coachella. It’s my first time here.” Later, Staples tweeted that “R.

His assistant, his accountant, his lawyer, and his rep have all said that they no longer work for him, although none of them have gone into detail about their departures and all have been supportive and complimentary toward Kelly in their statements. His longtime musical accompanist, DJ Phantom, was less circumspect about his decision to leave Kelly in December: “I didn’t know then what I know now,” he said. “He’s a shitbag.” In April, the Women of Color committee within Time’s Up threw its weight behind the #MuteRKelly campaign, calling for anyone currently profiting from Kelly and his music to drop him, including Spotify, Ticketmaster, and Kelly’s record label, RCA. Shortly thereafter, Spotify announced that it would no longer be promoting Kelly’s music, although his music would remain in their streaming catalog.

Kelly that makes it possible to forget exactly what he’s been accused of, how often he’s been accused, and how much proof there is against him. And most likely, that’s because his alleged victims are overwhelmingly young black women and hence apparently easy for America to ignore. “The saddest fact I’ve learned is: Nobody matters less to our society than young black women,” says Jim DeRogatis, the reporter who broke the R. Kelly story. “Nobody.” To try to combat that vagueness and the erasure that it makes possible, here is a timeline of all of the accusations of sexual misconduct against R. Kelly. Much of the chronology here is drawn from DeRogatis’s invaluable coverage of the R. Kelly accusations, including his own immensely thorough timeline. DeRogatis’s timeline covers the entire span of Kelly’s life, including his major career milestones and unrelated legal issues, but I’ve narrowed the focus of this timeline to specifically the sexual misconduct accusations against Kelly. Over the 24-year span of this timeline, a consistent pattern emerges. Over and over again, Kelly is accused of the same behavior: of targeting girls and very young women, isolating them, and controlling and abusing them. And after the dust from the accusation settles, Kelly goes on living his life with very few changes. Here, from Aaliyah to the alleged sex cult, are all the R. Kelly accusations. August 30, 1994: 27-year-old R. Kelly marries 15-year-old Aaliyah The ’90s music sensation Aaliyah was Kelly’s protégé. They met when she was 12 years old, and Kelly wrote and produced her first album in 1993. It was titled Age Ain’t Nothing but a Number. In 1995, Vibe magazine published a copy of their marriage license, with 15-year-old Aaliyah falsely listing her age as 18. “Family members say Aaliyah thought it was all an elaborate ‘game,’ and she just went along with it,” the Chicago Sun-Times later reported, adding that the marriage license was reportedly obtained by Kelly’s assistant, using a fake ID. “Within hours, she realized what had happened, and she went to her family and sought their help.” The marriage was annulled in 1994, just months after the ceremony. In the settlement, according to documents obtained by the Sun-Times, Aaliyah promises not to pursue further legal action because of “emotional distress caused","R. Kelly’s time may have finally come. For decades, he has faced multiple accusations of sexual relationships with minors, lawsuits for inappropriate sexual contact, and charges of creating child pornography. Last summer, he was accused of creating a manipulative and abusive ""sex cult"" of young women, and more women have since come forward with their own stories of abuse. Despite these allegations, Kelly's career has remained largely unaffected, with successful tours and appearances in popular films. However, recent developments such as the release of a documentary and the departure of key members from his inner circle, as well as the support of the Time's Up movement, suggest that he may finally face lasting consequences. However, it is important to acknowledge that the persistence of these accusations has largely been ignored by society, as his alleged victims are primarily young black women. This timeline aims to shed light on the numerous accusations against R. Kelly, highlighting the recurring pattern of targeting and abusing young women. The timeline begins with his marriage to underage singer Aaliyah in 1994, a marriage that was later annulled.",paraphrase_generation

During an interview with Task & Purpose for his new film ""Patriots Day,"" Wahlberg criticized celebrities who publicly denounced Donald Trump in the months leading up to the election.

She’s currently on vacation with friends in Sydney, Australia, where she appears to be carefree in this new video. However, a source reveals that the same can’t be said for Bieber. “Justin has Selena on the brain constantly. He is trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time but he keeps thinking about her,” a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “He always wants to be around her, talk to her and be with her.

gossipcop-28284230,"Not so fast! Madonna was hit with a series of “uncomfortable questions” by a judge before she was granted permission to adopt her 4-year-old twin girls from Malawi, the presiding judge said in court documents obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, February 8.  “The petitioner is a professional performer and I guarded myself against the danger of her merely reciting a well-rehearsed speech by asking her some rather uncomfortable questions to which she gave very candid answers,” Judge Fiona Mwale said in her ruling, explaining her reasons for approving the adoption.  After pressing Madonna, 58, to explain her intentions in adding two more little ones to her brood of four, Judge Mwale said she was satisfied that the girls would be in good hands with the Material Girl.  “There is no doubt that the petitioner can offer the infants not only the best education money can buy, but also guidance with a high likelihood of ensuring that the two infants grow to be self-sufficient adults,” Judge Mwale said, adding that she is satisfied that Madonna “is motivated by her desire to offer a home, love, protection and guidance to the infants.”  In the court documents, Judge Mwale addressed prior controversies surrounding Madonna’s adoptions in Malawi. “In determining her motives, I questioned the petitioner at length about the impact of her decision which could be construed as robbing Malawi of its most precious resource, its children,” the judge wrote.  As previously reported, Madonna filed for adoption in High Court in Malawi on January 25 but tried to keep the process under wraps until a final decision was made. (The Queen of Pop issued a statement denying her adoption to Us Weekly that same day, claiming that she was in Malawi “to check on the children’s hospital in Blantyre.”) According to the AP, she has already raised $7.5 million for a pediatric surgery ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, which is set to open early next year.  Madonna previously adopted son David and daughter Mercy James, both 11, from Malawi in 2008 and 2009, respectively. She is also mom to daughter Lourdes, 20, whom she shares with ex Carlos Leon, and son Rocco, 16, whom she shares with ex-husband Guy Ritchie.  Madonna’s twin girls will retain their birth names as a part of an effort to preserve their identity as Malawian nationals, the court documents said, and their father was at the January 25 court hearing with Madonna. (The twins’ mother died within a week of childbirth due to health complications.)  On Wednesday, February 8, Madonna took to social media to share the happy news. “I can officially confirm I have completed the process of adopting twin sisters from Malawi and am overjoyed that they are now part of our family,” she captioned an image of herself walking between the two little girls. “I am deeply grateful to all those in Malawi who helped make this possible, and I ask the media please to respect our privacy during this transitional time. 🙏🏻 Thank you also to my friends, family and my very large team for all your support and Love!”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

Bischoff acknowledges that reentering the dating scene after her breakup with Soules in 2015 was nerve-wracking, but she found comfort in the open communication with Angel. She wishes Soules the best and hopes he finds happiness with someone else. While Bischoff still watches The Bachelor, she has moved on from her own reality show experience since meeting Angel. She is currently focused on planning her wedding with him, which is expected to take place next fall. Bischoff remains positive about her past and believes that everything happens for a reason.",paraphrase_generation

gossipcop-6225895099,"Chris Soules, former star of ABC’s “The Bachelor,” after his arrest. (Buchanan County Sheriff via AP) Iowa farmer Chris Soules, a former star on ABC’s “The Bachelor” who charmed reality TV viewers with his small-town life, was arrested this week after police said he fled a crash that killed a fellow farmer. Soules, 35, was charged with leaving the scene of a fatal crash, a class D felony, and could face up to five years in prison if he is convicted. The case has garnered the attention of Soules’s “Bachelor” fans as well as residents of Arlington, Iowa, where he lives, who had come to appreciate the reality TV star’s work as an unofficial Iowa ambassador and farm industry advocate. “This story is going to spread like wildfire around here and probably all over because of who he is,” Mary Jo Brown, Arlington’s city clerk, told the Des Moines Register. “Sometimes fame isn’t your friend.” Soules, who also appeared in “Dancing with the Stars” and “Worst Chefs in America,” called 911 at 8:20 p.m. Monday evening to report that he had rear-ended a tractor on a rural road north of the tiny town of Aurora, about six miles away from his home. The tractor veered into a ditch after being struck by his 2008 Chevrolet Silverado, Soules said. The tractor driver — later identified as 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, a Vietnam War veteran — was unconscious and not breathing, Soules told the 911 operator, according to audio obtained by local media. The man had a pulse, but there was blood around his mouth, Soules said. Soules identified himself on the call, which lasted nearly six minutes, and sounded frantic.

(Buchanan County Sheriff via AP) Iowa farmer Chris Soules, a former star on ABC’s “The Bachelor” who charmed reality TV viewers with his small-town life, was arrested this week after police said he fled a crash that killed a fellow farmer. Soules, 35, was charged with leaving the scene of a fatal crash, a class D felony, and could face up to five years in prison if he is convicted. The case has garnered the attention of Soules’s “Bachelor” fans as well as residents of Arlington, Iowa, where he lives, who had come to appreciate the reality TV star’s work as an unofficial Iowa ambassador and farm industry advocate. “This story is going to spread like wildfire around here and probably all over because of who he is,” Mary Jo Brown, Arlington’s city clerk, told the Des Moines Register. “Sometimes fame isn’t your friend.” Soules, who also appeared in “Dancing with the Stars” and “Worst Chefs in America,” called 911 at 8:20 p.m. Monday evening to report that he had rear-ended a tractor on a rural road north of the tiny town of Aurora, about six miles away from his home. The tractor veered into a ditch after being struck by his 2008 Chevrolet Silverado, Soules said. The tractor driver — later identified as 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, a Vietnam War veteran — was unconscious and not breathing, Soules told the 911 operator, according to audio obtained by local media. The man had a pulse, but there was blood around his mouth, Soules said. Soules identified himself on the call, which lasted nearly six minutes, and sounded frantic. Between heavy breathing, he answered the dispatcher’s questions and took instructions. Soules told the 911 operator he did not know how to perform CPR and could be heard asking unidentified people at the scene if they could perform the lifesaving measure.

In 2011, he was charged three times with underage alcohol possession and pleaded guilty and paid a fine for an open container violation, reported the Des Moines Register. The following year, he received three citations for fighting and noise, unlawful use of a license and leaving the scene, which was amended down to defective brakes, court documents showed. Then in 2005, Soules was charged with driving while intoxicated and received one year of probation. A statement from Soules’s publicist earlier this week said he was “devastated” to learn that Mosher had died from the crash and that his “thoughts and prayers” were with the man’s family. Mosher, a lifelong resident of Aurora — population 200 — lived on his family farm near the crash site, reported the Argus Leader. He was married to his high school sweetheart, Nancy, and the couple had two sons and three grandchildren, according to Mosher’s obituary. An Army veteran, Mosher served six years, including a tour in Vietnam. He farmed his entire life and was a member of the Aurora American Legion and the Iowa Corn Growers Association. “Kenny loved playing golf, farming and spending his winters in Florida biking and visiting his mother,” Mosher’s obituary said. “His family was most important to him, especially his grandchildren.” In northeast Iowa, where Mosher and Soules both farmed, community members told local media they were heartbroken for the families of both men.

He proposed to Whitney Bischoff, a contestant from Chicago, but the two split after a brief engagement. He later competed on “Dancing with the Stars” and the Food Network’s “Worst Chefs in America.” Soules has since made guest appearances on various “Bachelor” franchise spin-offs shows and was rumored to be a cast member for this summer’s taping of “Bachelor in Paradise,” where former contestants search for love on","Chris Soules, a former star of ABC's ""The Bachelor,"" was arrested after allegedly fleeing the scene of a fatal crash in Iowa.

While Kim initially blamed Kanye's snoring for the separation, insiders claim there are deeper issues at play. They have reportedly lost the spark in their relationship and Kim, who is currently pregnant with their third child, no longer has the time or energy to invest in keeping their romance alive.

Angelina's constant traveling was an attempt to keep Brad away from anyone she perceived as a friend. She doesn't want anyone else to have a relationship with Brad, including his own family. The writer believes that Angelina's actions would eventually backfire and questions why it took Brad so long to realize her manipulative behavior. The writer suggests that Angelina suffers from a mental illness and doesn't have their children in school for similar reasons. They think she believed her relationship with Brad would last because she considers herself attractive and thinks men should do as she says. The treatment of her surrogate, Holly, made Brad see Angelina's true nature. The writer also points out that Angelina still talks to her exes, despite expecting Brad not to communicate with Jen. Brad's friends being women bothers Angelina, and she broke her promise to stay home and be a mother by taking on a salt role. It is mentioned how little time Angelina spends bonding with their twin babies. The writer implies that the only reason Brad hasn't finalized a separation is because of the kids.

There comes a time in every couple's relationship when the question of moving in together becomes impossible to ignore. And when those two lovebirds have been stepping out for 15 months — even though they live 3,500 miles apart; he in the UK, she in Canada — it's not so much a case of 'if' as of 'when' they will settle down.

And when those two lovebirds have been stepping out for 15 months — even though they live 3,500 miles apart; he in the UK, she in Canada — it's not so much a case of 'if' as of 'when' they will settle down. So it comes as no surprise that Prince Harry, 33, and his actress girlfriend Meghan Markle, 36, are said to be house-hunting. £7.25million - North Aston Manor, Oxfordshire: This eight bedroom property, overlooking the stunning Cherwell Valley, has seven reception rooms, a spa, swimming pool and 18.2 acres with equestrian facilities.

The local estate agents are excited about the prospect. After being together for 15 months, it is inevitable that the couple will eventually move in together. Prince Harry, with Meghan's input, is now house-hunting in Oxfordshire and has a particular interest in high-end properties in the Cotswold hills. He has always had an affinity for the area due to his childhood spent there. They are specifically looking for properties that offer privacy and are drawn to the rustic charm of the Cotswolds. The Cotswolds is also popular among other celebrities and influential figures, making it a desirable location. Harry is not simply relying on his father's property and wants to invest in his own place. The couple's close friends and relatives already live in the Cotswolds, which has influenced their decision. They prefer this area over Norfolk, where William and Kate currently reside. Over the past few months, Harry has been seen exploring various locations in the Cotswolds without Meghan. Moving to the Cotswolds makes sense for practical reasons as well, given Harry's royal responsibilities and Meghan's career.",paraphrase_generation

She believes that her positive affirmations play a significant role in maintaining her radiant appearance.

Photo credit: BACKGRID","According to a source close to Ben Affleck, the actor is facing a brain damage crisis following a motorcycle crash. The accident occurred last month on a crowded street in Los Angeles. Affleck, who has been pushing himself to the limits since his marriage breakdown, wrecked his new motorcycle while on his way to church. Despite hitting his head against a curb, he was able to walk away from the crash, although friends and medical professionals are concerned about the potential long-term effects. Doctors believe that the fall may have caused injuries to Affleck's skull, which could have serious implications. Without a proper examination, these injuries could go undetected and become life-threatening. Blunt force trauma to the head can lead to a subdural hematoma, which could result in permanent brain damage or death if left untreated. Affleck's crash does not come as a surprise to his friends, as he has a history of battling alcoholism and is known for his affinity for gambling.",paraphrase_generation

gossipcop-9639077061,"Ivanka Trump is becoming one of the most powerful first children in American History – despite not having an official job in the Trump administration. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Ivanka Trump’s products weren’t always the hottest items online. In January, for instance, the first daughter’s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes. That changed dramatically the following month. Sales of Trump’s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst’s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before. Yes, Feb. 9 — the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump’s clothing and jewelry line on “Fox & Friends.” “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would tell you,” Conway said. “I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.” And viewers did, apparently. Sales of Ivanka Trump’s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst) Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that “the beginning of February” shows “the best performing weeks in the history of the brand.” “For several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,” Klem said. Sarah Tanner, Lyst’s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton’s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter’s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company. Conway has come under fire for touting Ivanka Trump's clothing line during a televised interview. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) [A Trump wine boycott backfires spectacularly] But the brand was “largely featured” in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump’s brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had “been treated so unfairly” by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales. “It would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,” Tanner said of Conway’s Fox interview. “I think that’s one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.” Conway did not respond to an email requesting comment. Her promotion of the fashion line appeared to violate an ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products and immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. [Where does the Ivanka Trump brand go from here?] Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Conway’s comments were “absolutely wrong, wrong, wrong” and “clearly over the line,” The Washington Post reported. The White House later said that Conway had been “counseled.” But concerns about her comments remain. On Thursday, the government’s top ethics official criticized the White House for not disciplining Conway, The Post’s Drew Harwell reported. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, had urged officials last month to reprimand the White House counsel but was rebuffed. On Thursday he wrote to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues as the president’s deputy counsel. “When an employee’s conduct violates, disciplinary action serves to deter future misconduct,” Shaub wrote. “Not taking disciplinary action against a senior official under such circumstances risks undermining the ethics program.” [A Trump voter’s message to retailers: ‘Keep your mouths shut about our president’] Last month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway — a",1,en,"Ivanka Trump is becoming one of the most powerful first children in American History – despite not having an official job in the Trump administration.

Bar — partly because of her on-air endorsement of Trump’s products. According to Lyst, February drew unusually large numbers of orders across many Ivanka Trump-branded products, including dresses, shoes, pants, coats, knitwear and tops. Heels were the bestsellers, followed by dresses. “We’ve never seen such a large uptick,” Tanner said. “Typically, she’s not in our top 100 sellers.” Comparing February’s numbers with last year’s average number of orders of Ivanka Trump products shows a difference of 557 percent. (Tanner said company policy prohibits her from sharing the actual numbers of online sales.) The excitement of the brand, however, may be slumping. The company’s numbers show sales were gradually tapering off toward the end of February. March does not appear to be as remarkable, but sales are still on track to be about 8 percent better than they were in January, according to Lyst.

Related: Toby Keith, 3 Doors Down to Play Inauguration-Related Event  In an interview with The Associated Press on Friday, Holliday defended her decision to perform at the inauguration.  ""I didn't see it as singing for Trump; I saw it as singing for the people on the mall,"" Holliday told the AP.  The performer, who most recently starred on Broadway in ""The Color Purple,"" said she was hurt by the angry backlash, which included calls to boycott her music. Others called her ""Uncle Tom"" and there was even a suggestion that she take her own life.  ""It just really made my heart drop to my feet,"" Holliday said. ""How could I have this much hate spewing at me, and I haven't even done anything? I guess it's not like those old days when political views were your own and you had freedom of speech. ... We live in a different time now, and a decision to go and do something for America is not so clear-cut anymore.""  Holliday was to perform at the ""Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration"" which included Keith, Voight, and Trump himself.  The celebrity wattage for Trump's inaugural festivities doesn't rival that of Barack Obama's inaugurations, which attracted top names including Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen, U2, Alicia Keys, Kelly Clarkson, Eva Longoria and Jennifer Hudson, among others. But Trump has insisted that's how he wants it, saying the swearing-in festivities should be about the people, not the A-list stars.","Broadway star Jennifer Holliday has withdrawn from performing at the upcoming presidential inaugural due to backlash from her fans, particularly from the LGBTQ community. Holliday expressed regret for her earlier decision and apologized for causing any disappointment. This withdrawal follows the pattern of several other prominent entertainers who have declined to perform at the inauguration. Despite this, country star Toby Keith and actor Jon Voigt are still expected to participate in the concert. Holliday's decision was confirmed by her representative, who shared a letter she wrote to her fans in which she emphasized her support for the LGBTQ community. In a previous interview, Holliday defended her initial decision, explaining that she saw it as performing for the people in attendance rather than a political statement. However, the negative response she received, including death threats and calls for boycotts, deeply affected her. Holliday was scheduled to perform at the ""Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration"" alongside Keith, Voigt, and President-elect Donald Trump. Compared to Barack Obama's inaugurations, Trump's event does not feature as many high-profile celebrities. Trump has stated that he prefers the focus to be on the people rather than the presence of A-list stars.",paraphrase_generation
gossipcop-2194660040,"First Lady Melania Trump claims there is a secret poisoner in the White House and fears her husband is being slowly poisoned with “heavy sedatives” smuggled into his drinks in an attempt to slow him down, control him, and discredit his presidency, according to reports.  While public debate rages about Donald Trump’s health, Melania has told friends and associates that the once robust and high energy man she knew and loved has been replaced with a “slower, damaged version”.  “By 8pm he is slurring,” she said. “This is not the man I know.”  Fearing that the sedatives are being pumped into the body of the POTUS via Coca-Cola that he orders by pressing a button he had installed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Melania has insisted he stop drinking from the tap and instead revert to drinking from cans she brings herself.  “Donald’s heath improved out of sight when he stopped drinking from the tap,” Melania said.  However the First Lady fears the active campaign to poison the president is “a high level operation” and “not the work of a solitary loon.”  Melania is popular in the White House—as she is with the rest of the country—and she has befriended senior intelligence agency staff who remain loyal to president. They have educated her about Ronald Regan’s poisoning by the Deep State after his assassination attempt in 1981. They have also warned her that George W. Bush was reduced to a “brain damaged” state after years of steady poisoning.  But the advantage Trump may hold over his GOP predecessors in the Oval Office is that he has a wife who is wise to the ruse and is insisting he watch his food and drink intake closely for signs of adulteration.  Donald Trump’s food choices say a lot about the man. The president’s Howard Hughes-level pickiness when it comes to food is partly motivated by a desire to avoid being poisoned, according to Melania. He doesn’t trust those around him – and rightfully so.  As President Trump knows all too well, there are enemies of the state dug in deep at the White House.  Reporters from TIME recently got a glimpse behind-the-scenes at the White House, where they reported on what goes down at the president’s dinner table. Of particular interest was a meal enjoyed by the reporters, Trump, and Vice President Pence.  Pence’s meal was not unusual—he ate what everyone else did.

She believes that someone is smuggling heavy sedatives into his drinks, causing him to appear slower and less energetic. Melania suspects that the sedatives may be hidden in the Coca-Cola ordered by the President, prompting her to bring cans of the drink herself for him to consume. She views this operation as being highly organized and not the work of an individual acting alone. Melania has been informed by senior intelligence agency staff about previous instances of poisoning of presidents, such as Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. She remains vigilant about Trump's food and drink intake, being aware of the potential threats posed by enemies within the White House. The President's cautiousness around food is attributed partly to his fear of being poisoned, as he has developed a lack of trust towards those around him.",paraphrase_generation

The action star has steadily starred in film after film, yet has been at the center of several dating rumors.  As the International Business Times reports, “The actor was mistakenly linked to an Australian journalist and then was associated to his Mission: Impossible 6 co-star and Crown actress Vanessa Kirby.”  All rumors until now have been stamped out as false.

Reps for Lambert and Shelton did not return Fox News' requests for comment.  It's been reported that Lambert and Shelton's romance began as an affair but both singers have denied this in the past. They became engaged in May 2010 and married a year later in Texas. The country singers announced their divorce after four years of marriage in July 2015.  The ""Tin Man"" singer, who recently ended things with her boyfriend of two years, Anderson East, reportedly began seeing Felker when his band joined Lambert's ""Livin’ Like Hippies"" tour in January.  Felker married global strategist Staci Nelson in September 2016. The singer filed for divorce on Feb. 16 while Nelson filed 12 days later.  Nelson, who still goes by her married name on social media, shared a tearful selfie on Thursday with the caption, ""PSA: If Staci Felker can make it through this week, so can you.""","Blake Shelton may need a lesson in karma himself. Last week, Shelton caused controversy with a cryptic tweet about karma, just as reports surfaced that his ex-wife Miranda Lambert was dating a married man. Shelton tweeted, ""Been taking the high road for a long time... I almost gave up. But I can finally see something on the horizon up there!! Wait!! Could it be?! Yep!! It's karma!!"" This tweet came after various outlets reported that Lambert had started dating Evan Felker, the married front man of the Turnpike Troubadours. However, Lambert's ex-boyfriend Jeff Allen claims that Shelton is not as innocent as he pretends to be. In a now-deleted tweet, Allen called out Shelton for starting a relationship with Lambert while Shelton was still married to his first wife in 2006. Allen wrote, ""You know, I've always given you the benefit of the doubt and chalked it up to just being human, but you must be one arrogant SOB to pop off something like this, when I know damn good and well you were cheating on your wife and Miranda was cheating on me when you two started up."" Allen told RadarOnline.com that while he believes Lambert may have wronged Shelton, he doesn't understand why Shelton sees it as karma, considering his own actions. Allen also emphasized that he does not have ill feelings towards Lambert and described her as a loving and caring person. Representatives for Lambert and Shelton did not respond to requests for comment from Fox News. Although it has been reported that Lambert and Shelton's relationship began as an affair, both singers have denied this in the past. They became engaged in 2010 and married the following year in Texas. The couple announced their divorce in 2015 after four years of marriage. Lambert, who recently ended her relationship with Anderson East, allegedly began seeing Felker when his band joined her tour in January. Felker was married to Staci Nelson in 2016, but both parties have filed for divorce in recent weeks. Nelson shared a tearful selfie on social media, expressing her resilience amidst the situation.",paraphrase_generation

Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It’s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.”  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer “pinches me on the ass a lot.” A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer’s firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC’s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer’s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.  In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, “It’s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I’m ready to.

The movement inspired the new Time’s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time’s Up was a major focus at this year’s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  “I think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,” Couric tells PEOPLE about Time’s Up. “Clearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.”  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  “One of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,” she says. “I just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this.

Brothers, James Stanford Poore, 32, and Cedric Dwayne Poore, 39, were arrested and booked on four complaints each of first degree murder, Chief Chuck Jordan said.  On Monday, January 7, 2013, twin sisters Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Powell-Melchor, 23; Misty Nunley, 33, and Julie Jackson, 55 were found shot in the head, with their hands tied behind their backs inside a south Tulsa apartment, police say. A 3-year-old boy was also found inside the apartment, unharmed.  Chief Jordan said the murders were not gang-related. According to arrest reports, witnesses told investigators that the brothers left an apartment in the same building at Fairmont Terrace Apartments, near 61st and Peoria, saying they were going to pull a ""lick"" at the victims' apartment.  Witnesses told police the brothers returned about 20 minutes later with a bag full of drugs, cash, and jewelry. According to the report, James Poore told the witnesses that he shot one of the victims because she could identify him and that Cedric shot the other three. The witnesses told investigators the brothers split the money and that Cedric Poore took the jewelry to pawn.    When he was interviewed Wednesday, James Poore confirmed to investigators that he knew one of the victims and that he was in the apartment where the witnesses placed him. Before invoking his right to remain silent, he told investigators he knew one of the victims had used and sold illegal drugs and that Cedric drove a black van to the apartment the day of the murders.    The arrest report shows Cedric Poore denied being in the apartment the day of the murders and refused to speak to investigators any more.  Chief Jordan said the brothers both stayed at Fairmont Terrace Apartments. The property manager there told News On 6 that neither of them are on a lease.  Cedric Poore has been in Tulsa County jail on a traffic violation since January 14, and James Poore was arrested Wednesday morning. Department of Corrections records show both James and Cedric have been previously convicted and incarcerated for robbery with a firearm.  Chief Jordan said more arrests may still be made.  Mayor Dewey Bartlett released a statement Wednesday afternoon, in response to the news of the arrests:    ""The Tulsa Police Department is known for their quick efforts of finding perpetrators and they indeed lived up to their stellar reputation for this case. I have the utmost confidence in Chief Chuck Jordan and the Tulsa Police Department and I knew they would bring in those involved with this hideous quadruple murder in very short order. Although a direct tip from the public cannot be identified as the catalyst that led to the arrests, tips are always important, which is part of great police work from our force.""",1,en,"Two arrests have been made in the murders of four women at Fairmont Terrace Apartments last month, police announced Wednesday afternoon.

When he was interviewed Wednesday, James Poore confirmed to investigators that he knew one of the victims and that he was in the apartment where the witnesses placed him. Before invoking his right to remain silent, he told investigators he knew one of the victims had used and sold illegal drugs and that Cedric drove a black van to the apartment the day of the murders.    The arrest report shows Cedric Poore denied being in the apartment the day of the murders and refused to speak to investigators any more.  Chief Jordan said the brothers both stayed at Fairmont Terrace Apartments. The property manager there told News On 6 that neither of them are on a lease.  Cedric Poore has been in Tulsa County jail on a traffic violation since January 14, and James Poore was arrested Wednesday morning. Department of Corrections records show both James and Cedric have been previously convicted and incarcerated for robbery with a firearm.  Chief Jordan said more arrests may still be made.  Mayor Dewey Bartlett released a statement Wednesday afternoon, in response to the news of the arrests:    ""The Tulsa Police Department is known for their quick efforts of finding perpetrators and they indeed lived up to their stellar reputation for this case. I have the utmost confidence in Chief Chuck Jordan and the Tulsa Police Department and I knew they would bring in those involved with this hideous quadruple murder in very short order. Although a direct tip from the public cannot be identified as the catalyst that led to the arrests, tips are always important, which is part of great police work from our force.""","Police have announced that two arrests have been made in connection with the murders of four women at Fairmont Terrace Apartments last month. The suspects, James Stanford Poore, 32, and Cedric Dwayne Poore, 39, have been booked on four charges each of first degree murder. Chief Chuck Jordan stated that the murders were not gang-related. Witnesses informed investigators that the brothers left an apartment in the same building as the victims, claiming they were going to commit a crime. They returned 20 minutes later with drugs, cash, and jewelry. It is alleged that James Poore confessed to shooting one victim and Cedric shot the other three. Witnesses also reported that the brothers divided the money and Cedric pawned the jewelry. James Poore admitted to knowing one of the victims and being present at the scene before exercising his right to remain silent. Cedric Poore denied being at the scene and refused to cooperate further. Both brothers were residents of Fairmont Terrace Apartments, although they were not on a lease. Cedric Poore had been in jail since January 14 for a traffic violation, while James Poore was arrested on Wednesday morning. Both have previous convictions for robbery with a firearm. Chief Jordan stated that further arrests may follow. Mayor Dewey Bartlett commended the Tulsa Police Department for their prompt action in solving the case, although it is unclear if public tips played a role in the arrests.",paraphrase_generation

They haven't seen each other in several weeks as they both travel frequently. Tess has expressed remorse to her ex for dating Harry and acknowledges that it will take time to regain their trust. However, they have been getting along well and have been inseparable since they met up in London this week. It's a pity Harry is feeling down, but perhaps a fancy shirt or a pair of flashy boots will lift his spirits. The two were first linked together last month when a source revealed that Harry instantly became infatuated with Tess after being introduced by mutual friends. They connected over their shared love for unique fashion and food, and their relationship quickly turned romantic. While in London, Harry has taken Tess on many dates and has introduced her to his close friends, including his personal stylist. This relationship seems different from Harry's past ones, as he is genuinely infatuated with Tess and doesn't want to jeopardize it. Poor Harry.

The country superstar opened up about his romance with the No Doubt frontwoman in a new interview with Billboard magazine.  As previously reported, Shelton told Stefani that he was splitting from Lambert during a meeting with their Voice coworkers. The “Misery” singer, who was new to the team at the time, got emotional.  “I won’t forget that day. I looked over at Gwen — who I didn’t really know — and she had these huge tears in her eyes. I thought, ‘Wow, she feels super bad for me!’” Shelton recalled. “She didn’t tell me much, because we didn’t know each other at the time, but she said, ‘I’m going through something very similar to what you’re going through. I understand. And I hate it.’”  Stefani was dealing with her own breakup at the time with Gavin Rossdale. (As Us Weekly exclusively revealed, the Bush rocker was cheating on her with their children’s nanny, Mindy Mann.) They announced they were ending their 13-year marriage in August 2015, one month after Shelton and Lambert announced they were divorcing after four years.  The “Came Here to Forget” singer and Stefani leaned on each other for support during the difficult time. The closer they got, the more Shelton saw Stefani in a new light.  “That’s kind of how our friendship and bond started, that day. It went from that, to checking in on each other once a week through email — ‘This s–t happened to me, what happened to you?’ — to maybe three times a week, then every day, to ‘Hey, here’s my phone number if you ever want to text,’” Shelton told Billboard. “Next thing I know, I wake up and she’s all I care about, and I’m ­wondering if she feels the same about me.”  “Gwen saved my life,” he added. “Who else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician? You can’t even imagine the similarities in our divorces.”  The two teamed up professionally too. Shelton included their collaborative track, “Go Ahead and Break My Heart,” on his 12th studio album, If I’m Honest.  “When we recorded the vocals for some of these songs, I was only six months removed from when all the crap went down,” Shelton said of his split from Lambert. “When you have a broken heart — at least, when I do — you got to get it out of your system.

It’s been more than two years since Blake Shelton, 40, and Miranda Lambert, 33, ended their marriage, but she’s finally ready to sit down and hash things out, according to a new report. Amidst new rumors that Blake is having trouble in his relationship with Gwen Stefani, 47, an insider tells InTouch that Miranda wants to confront her ex to finally get closure. “It needs to be done,” the source tells the mag. “There’s still a lot of unfinished business between [Miranda] and Blake. She needs to look straight into Blake’s eyes, ask certain questions, and get answers.”  There are no plans set for this meeting to actually take place just yet, but the mag claims that if it does happen, Miranda plans to go in with a “clear head,” although that might not be so easy. “This could get heated,” the insider admits. “As soon as the emotions come up, [Miranda] may lose it.” This doesn’t mean the 33-year-old wants to get back together with her ex, though — actually, it’s just the opposite. She’s very happy with her man, Anderson East, 29, but feels a face-to-face with Blake is what she needs to fully be ready to commit to another relationship, according to the source.  “She feels that [she and Blake] have both grown so much since their divorce that meeting up is essential for them to have healthy relationships in the future,” InTouch’s insider says. “Who knows, maybe this meeting with Blake will have them walk away as friends. Either way, they’ll definitely be in a better place.”  As for the rumored trouble between Blake and Gwen, we’re going to take that report (from OK! magazine) with a grain of salt. After all, they were just spotted looking totally in love on Aug. 20!

But I’m not forcing anything right now.”  As far as her relationship with the 42-year-old former Yankees player, she said: “It’s good, it’s healthy; we communicate well. We understand each other’s lives in a way that most other people couldn’t.”  She added: “We both entered the public eye in our early twenties and overachieved right from the start. And that affects every dynamic in your life, from your family to your work to your relationships. We have a similar makeup.”  The pair celebrated their anniversary in February in Minneapolis, where the singer performed a concert ahead of the Super Bowl. During the show, she debuted her single “Us” written by Poo Bear and produced by Skrillex, and dedicated it to Rodriguez, who was in the audience. “We’ve been together for one year today.

Craig has already announced his intent to return as 007 in the franchise’s 25th film, and according to the National Enquirer, he’s still struggling to salvage what’s left of his marriage.  The Enquirer’s source claimed at the beginning of 2017, “Rachel and Daniel haven’t been happy for a while, and nearly called it quits last year.” The report claims that the married couple was in two separate filming locations at the beginning of the year, but continued to stay apart even after wrapping their respective films. The Enquirer then claims that they finally reunited in July after not being seen together in ‘554 days’.  According to the sources, the minute the outlet attempted to lock down an exclusive on the couple’s rocky marriage, both Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig were seen arriving at New York’s Public Theater the next day, prompting the source to add, “The whole thing just seemed like too much of a coincidence. I don’t buy it for a minute.”  When you consider Daniel Craig’s own words, especially in the context of allegedly turning down a $150 million payday to star in two more James Bond films, he had stated, “Being on your own would be sad, sick, and weird. I don’t trust myself. I need that balance.” If these reports are to be believed, then Daniel Craig previously turned down starring in more Bond films to spend time with his family, but now – all of a sudden – he’s back to working on James Bond?  Either the report was never accurate to begin with, or he’s giving up on his marriage to Rachel Weisz. One would hope that the two have worked out whatever was troubling them in the first place, but given their own relationship and marriage histories – and how they’ve both jumped ship on long-term relationships at the drop of a hat – one wouldn’t be faulted for assuming that they are on their way to getting a divorce.  What do you guys think? Are Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz having marriage troubles, and is Daniel’s decision to take on the role of 007 again an indication that he’s giving up on his marriage?

He has announced his involvement in the 25th Bond film, but according to the National Enquirer, their marriage is facing difficulties. The couple allegedly had a rough patch and almost broke up last year. Even when they were filming in different locations at the beginning of the year, they continued to live separately after completing their respective projects. However, they were seen together in public in July after 554 days apart, which some find suspicious. The Enquirer suggests that their sudden reunion was prompted by the outlet's attempt to obtain an exclusive about their troubled marriage.

gossipcop-4774142356,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T",1,en,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.

T","Katie Holmes is facing a challenging situation, as rumors circulate regarding her relationships with Jamie Foxx, Tom Cruise, and their daughter Suri. According to RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of getting married, planning a grand ceremony with Suri as a bridesmaid. This event would have solidified their relationship, which had been mostly covert for the past five years. However, Holmes discovered that Foxx was not ready to give up his bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with his ex-girlfriend Kristin Grannis, who is the mother of his daughter. This realization prompted Holmes to call off the wedding and break up with Foxx. A source informed RadarOnline that Foxx was reluctant to sign a prenuptial agreement with a no-cheating clause, as it would have been costly for him to be unfaithful. Holmes noticed a lack of respect in Foxx's behavior, which she deemed unhealthy for herself and Suri, leading her to protect them by ending the relationship. Simultaneously, it seems that Holmes has been dealing with Cruise's attempts to reconnect with Suri. According to Star magazine and Hollywood Life, Cruise was separated from his daughter due to the influence of his Church of Scientology superiors. Despite being a loyal Scientologist, Cruise is tired of being controlled and misses out on her life. Holmes, however, does not want a reunion as she made an agreement with Cruise to stay quiet about him and Scientology as long as he stays away from Suri and doesn't try to indoctrinate her into the controversial organization. Nevertheless, Holmes is torn because she wants what is best for Suri and believes that her daughter is missing her father. Ultimately, Holmes may be considering the possibility of a reunion. Representatives for Holmes have denied the reports about the breakup with Foxx and the potential reunion with Cruise and Suri. However, it is worth noting that Holmes' publicist, Leslie Sloane, personally denied the breakup report, which carries significance since it is the first official acknowledgment of their relationship from either Holmes or Foxx. The couple had kept their relationship a secret since 2013, with Holmes even wearing disguises to meet Foxx in public. The secrecy was necessary due to a divorce settlement agreement with Cruise that prohibited Holmes from publicly dating anyone for five years. Speculation arose in September 2017 when Holmes and Foxx were photographed together on a beach, suggesting that the previously imposed dating ban had ended.",paraphrase_generation

Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin' to Get Out (1982). Her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993), followed by her first leading role in a major film, Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999). Jolie's starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her successful action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014). In the 2010s, Jolie expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), By the Sea (2015), and First They Killed My Father (2017). In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she separated from her third husband, actor Brad Pitt, in September 2016. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally. Early life and family Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand.

In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she separated from her third husband, actor Brad Pitt, in September 2016. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally. Early life and family Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[2] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[3] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[4] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[5][6] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[5] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[7] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[5][8] After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[9] Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.[10] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[11] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[12] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[13] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[9] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions. Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area's affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income. She was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.[11] Her early attempts at modeling, at her mother's insistence, proved unsuccessful.[14][15] She then transferred to Moreno High School, an alternative school, where she became a ""punk outsider,""[14] wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing, and experimenting with knife play with her live-in boyfriend.[11] She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director,[12] taking at-home courses to study embalming.[16] At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies,[9][14] though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation, ""I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk kid with tattoos.""[17] As a teenager, Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she self-harmed,[18] later commenting, ""For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me.""[19] She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder,[16] and began experimenting with drugs; by age 20, she had used ""just about every drug possible,"" particularly heroin.[20] Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicide—at age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her.[12] When she was 24, she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center's psychiatric ward.[12] Two years later, after adopting her first child, Jolie found stability in her life, later stating, ""I knew once I committed to Maddox, I would never be self-destructive again.""[21] Jolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father, which began when Voight left the family when his daughter was less than a year old.[22] She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press.[23] They reconciled when they appeared together in","""Jolie"" refers to Angelina Jolie. She is an American actress, filmmaker, and humanitarian. Jolie has achieved various accolades, including an Academy Award and Golden Globe Awards. She entered the film industry at a young age and gained recognition for her roles in movies such as ""Girl, Interrupted"" and ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider."" Additionally, Jolie has expanded her career to include directing and producing. Apart from her film career, she is well-known for her humanitarian efforts, particularly her work with refugees. Jolie has been recognized for her influence and power in the entertainment industry. She has also been consistently cited as one of the most beautiful women in the world. Jolie has had multiple marriages and is a mother to six children, three of whom are adopted. She comes from a family of actors, including her father Jon Voight and her brother James Haven. Jolie has faced personal challenges and struggles throughout her life, including self-harm, drug use, and mental health issues. However, she found stability and purpose after adopting her first child. Jolie's relationship with her father has been tumultuous but they have occasionally reconciled, often in the public eye.",paraphrase_generation
gossipcop-1551062653,"  George Clooney and his wife, Amal, attend the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. (Alberto Pizzoli/AFP via Getty Images)  Once the ultimate bachelor — and two-time People’s Sexiest Man Alive cover model — George Clooney entered entirely new territory this week.  The Oscar-winning actor and his human-rights-lawyer wife of two years, Amal, announced Tuesday that they are the proud new parents of twins, Ella and Alexander.  Clooney has donned many hats in his life — actor, director, producer and activist, but fatherhood had always seemed far away. Was it the early-onset-salt-and-pepper hair? The coterie of models who found themselves on his arm for fleeting moments over the years? The insistence by tabloids and fellow co-stars that it was time for him to settle down? Maybe. Or perhaps it was the simple fact that Clooney himself said again and again that he would not reproduce. In several interviews. Many, many times. For many, many years.  A first-time father at 56, Clooney was often asked throughout his career whether the single life was his ultimate future. But after proposing marriage to Amal in April 2014 and marrying her that September (as well as sharing wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain), it seemed as if anything was possible for the man who once said, “I don’t see myself ever having kids.”  But it was a long road to get there. “I don’t have that gene that people have to replicate,” he told People in 2006.  When Esquire asked him why he wasn’t married with kids, he replied, “I haven’t had aspirations in that way, ever.” And as for people who thought it was weird that a man in his 50s was single and childless? “What do you do? Should I go, ‘I got to get me some kids right now!’ and rush out and impregnate someone?”  Clooney seemed to express frustration when asked how he could ever relate to the fathers he occasionally portrays onscreen. His answer: “Well, I’m also not running for president, but I played that role in ‘Ides of March.’ I wasn’t an actual lawyer when I did ‘Michael Clayton,’ and I don’t fire people for a living like I did in ‘Up in the Air.’ ”  “I keep saying I’ll never get married again or have children but people just don’t want to believe me,” Clooney told Britain’s Daily Express just three months before popping the question to his now-wife.  Of course, celebrities are people, too, and it shouldn’t surprise anyone that a man might change his mind around the midcentury mark. And Clooney is certainly not alone in choosing to wait till later in life to welcome a child into the family: Comedian Steve Martin became a father at age 67 in 2012; Elton John was 63 when he had a baby via a surrogate in 2010; and Chris Noth was 53 when he welcomed his only child in 2008.  Perhaps it’s the fact that Clooney always seemed so delightfully and devilishly Clooney-ish that made his bachelordom seem like the only constant in our ever-changing popular culture. But we can rest easy knowing that despite some hesitation about having a family over the years, his sense of humor has remained steady throughout.  “Ella, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine,” the statement announcing the birth of the twins read. “George is sedated and should recover in a few days.”",1,en,"  George Clooney and his wife, Amal, attend the 2016 Cannes Film Festival.

However, this week marked a significant change for Clooney, who was once known as the ultimate bachelor and a two-time cover model for People's Sexiest Man Alive. He and his wife, Amal, who is a human-rights lawyer, proudly announced on Tuesday that they have become parents to twins, Ella and Alexander. Up until now, fatherhood seemed unlikely for Clooney, given his reputation as a bachelor and his previous statements about not wanting to have children. In several interviews over the years, he expressed his lack of desire to reproduce. Despite this, at the age of 56, Clooney surprised many by marrying Amal in 2014 and sharing wedding photos with People magazine and Hello magazine. While he had never envisioned himself settling down with a family, he eventually changed his tune. Clooney often faced questions about his single status and the absence of children throughout his career. However, he brushed off these inquiries and expressed his lack of interest in marriage and children. In 2006, he told People magazine that he did not have the desire to replicate. When asked why he wasn't married with kids by Esquire, he simply stated that he never aspired to have them. He also sarcastically responded to those who found it strange that he was single and childless in his 50s. Despite his initial reservations, Clooney later proposed to Amal and got married. However, his journey to embracing fatherhood was not without its challenges. Three months prior to his marriage, he expressed his skepticism about getting married or having children in an interview with Britain's Daily Express. Nevertheless, it is not uncommon for people to change their minds later in life, and Clooney is no exception. Many celebrities, like Steve Martin, Elton John, and Chris Noth, have also chosen to become parents later in life. Clooney's charming and playful persona may have contributed to the perception that he would remain a bachelor forever, but his recent decision to start a family proves otherwise. Despite his initial hesitations, Clooney's sense of humor has remained intact throughout this journey. The statement announcing the birth of his twins noted that Ella, Alexander, and Amal are all in good health and that George is recovering after being sedated.",paraphrase_generation

Wiig, who is mostly known for her comedy chops, would be the adversary to Gal Gadot’s Diana Prince. This time the superhero has skipped ahead in time from World War II to fight crime in the 1980s. Cheetah, who was originally depicted as the alter ego of a socialite, will probably fit right in with Reagan’s America. Though, then again, since this is the Cold War she could suddenly become a Soviet. Patty Jenkins is also returning as the film’s director.","Actress Kristen Wiig is reportedly being considered for the role of Cheetah, a classic comic-book villain, in the highly anticipated sequel to Wonder Woman. Wiig, known primarily for her comedic talent, would serve as the antagonist to Gal Gadot's Diana Prince as she fights crime in the 1980s, a departure from the previous World War II setting. Cheetah, originally portrayed as a socialite, is expected to blend well into the backdrop of Ronald Reagan's America, although the possibility of her being associated with the Soviet Union during the Cold War cannot be ruled out. Director Patty Jenkins will also be returning for the film.",paraphrase_generation

The actor appears on the September cover of GQ where he explained why he chooses to stay very quiet when it comes to his private life.  “I always think the risk reward is very much weighted in the wrong direction,” Pattinson, 31, said of opening up in interviews. “If I could stay silent, I would.”  Pattinson has been dating singer F.K.A.

He would also try to confuse photographers by having all of his friends order different rides out of restaurants when they were together and sending the cars to different places after trading outfits with one of his friends. Pattinson also recalled riding in trunks several times to hide from the photographers – and once drove around all night when one was tailing him to find out where his new house is.  “There are ways to disappear, like, fairly easily,” he said. “It just involves effort, and most people can’t be bothered to put the effort in.”  Good Time hits theaters August 11.",1,en,"After years of overexposure thanks to his star-making turn in Twilight, Robert Pattinson values his privacy.

gossipcop-7658353025,"“A Star Is Born” is that thing we always yearn for but so rarely get to see: a transcendent Hollywood movie. It’s the fourth remake of a story that dates back to 1932, but this one has a look and vibe all its own — rapturous and swooning, but also delicate and intimate and luminous. It’s set in the present day, but in spirit it’s a sophisticated retro ’70s drama built around the uncanny flow of feeling that develops between the movie’s two stars: Bradley Cooper, who plays Jackson Maine, a hard-drinking, bad-ol’-boy redneck rock ‘n’ roller who is still hanging on as a popular attraction but has lost the lust for what he’s doing, and Lady Gaga, in her fetching and accomplished movie-star debut, as Ally, an ingenuous, fresh-faced singer-songwriter who becomes his lover and stage partner before rocketing on her own into the new pop stratosphere. She takes off as he slowly crashes — that’s the soapy tragic “Star Is Born” concept. But what the movie does is to take this fabled melodramatic romantic seesaw and turn it into something indelibly heartfelt and revealing. Cooper directed the movie himself, working from a script he co-wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, and to say that he does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment. As a filmmaker, Bradley Cooper gets right onto the high wire, staging scenes that take their time and play out with a shaggy intimacy that’s shorn of the usual “beats.” The new “Star Is Born” is a total emotional knockout, but it’s also a movie that gets you to believe, at every step, in the complicated rapture of the story it’s telling. More Reviews Venice Film review: 'Isis, Tomorrow. The Lost Souls of Mosul' Telluride Film Review: 'They'll Love Me When I'm Dead' The 1976 version, starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, had some terrific cornball love songs, but they didn’t belong anywhere near the stadium-rock stage, and neither did Streisand, which is part of why the movie came off as borderline ludicrous. It seemed stranded, with a kind of campy sincere ineptitude, between three worlds: Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand rock-princess fantasy. But from the electrifying opening moments of the new version, in which Jackson, boozy and raw, with his sunburned squint and hard-bitten shit-kicker sexiness, takes the stage of a gigantic stadium and launches into a grinding slow rocker that sounds like “Victim of Love”-era Eagles as done by the Allman Brothers, the movie is thrillingly authentic.

It’s the fourth remake of a story that dates back to 1932, but this one has a look and vibe all its own — rapturous and swooning, but also delicate and intimate and luminous. It’s set in the present day, but in spirit it’s a sophisticated retro ’70s drama built around the uncanny flow of feeling that develops between the movie’s two stars: Bradley Cooper, who plays Jackson Maine, a hard-drinking, bad-ol’-boy redneck rock ‘n’ roller who is still hanging on as a popular attraction but has lost the lust for what he’s doing, and Lady Gaga, in her fetching and accomplished movie-star debut, as Ally, an ingenuous, fresh-faced singer-songwriter who becomes his lover and stage partner before rocketing on her own into the new pop stratosphere. She takes off as he slowly crashes — that’s the soapy tragic “Star Is Born” concept. But what the movie does is to take this fabled melodramatic romantic seesaw and turn it into something indelibly heartfelt and revealing. Cooper directed the movie himself, working from a script he co-wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, and to say that he does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment. As a filmmaker, Bradley Cooper gets right onto the high wire, staging scenes that take their time and play out with a shaggy intimacy that’s shorn of the usual “beats.” The new “Star Is Born” is a total emotional knockout, but it’s also a movie that gets you to believe, at every step, in the complicated rapture of the story it’s telling. More Reviews Venice Film review: 'Isis, Tomorrow. The Lost Souls of Mosul' Telluride Film Review: 'They'll Love Me When I'm Dead' The 1976 version, starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, had some terrific cornball love songs, but they didn’t belong anywhere near the stadium-rock stage, and neither did Streisand, which is part of why the movie came off as borderline ludicrous. It seemed stranded, with a kind of campy sincere ineptitude, between three worlds: Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand rock-princess fantasy. But from the electrifying opening moments of the new version, in which Jackson, boozy and raw, with his sunburned squint and hard-bitten shit-kicker sexiness, takes the stage of a gigantic stadium and launches into a grinding slow rocker that sounds like “Victim of Love”-era Eagles as done by the Allman Brothers, the movie is thrillingly authentic. That’s no minor accomplishment.

He’s got a signature ballad that goes “Maybe it’s time to let the old ways die,” and when he wrote it (long ago), he probably didn’t know that he was talking about himself. In the first of many telling jump cuts, the film leaps from his on-stage glory to Jackson slinking into the back of his car, weary and alone, grabbing the bottle of gin he’s got stashed there. He takes a guzzle, and Cooper, acting with his body, lets you feel just how much Jackson (between sickly coughs) needs the lifeblood of that drink. It’s what he believes in more than the show he’s just finished. How do you play a drunk? We know, of course, that the answer is not to “play drunk,” but Cooper doesn’t just avoid the usual slurry shambling (though at key moments he does a little of that too, and it’s powerful). He brings off something I’ve rarely seen done this exquisitely: He plays blitzed, very functional and in his element, his smile and reflexes greased by the liquor. Jackson speaks in a deep, low, deliberate Southern-stud growl — a voice with real music in it, though one that lets you taste all the booze it’s marinated in. Needing another drink, he has his driver drop him off at the first available bar, which turns out to be a roadside dive on drag-queen karaoke night. It’s not his scene, but he doesn’t mind. He’s the same celebrity everywhere he goes, so he’s in the perfect mood of lit-up contentment when she walks on stage. She is Ally, the one non-drag performer of the night (she’s friends with all the queens there, so they let her sing for real). When she enters the room, the movie pulls off a neat trick. We’ve already seen Ally break up with her boyfriend over the phone, letting out a banshee wail in the process, and when she appears in heavy white-make up and pasted on half-circle eyebrows, her hair teased into a punked-out French pastry, then does a strutting-down-the-bar version of “La Vie en Rose” that she milks for every flourish of theatrical kitsch she can, we think, “Of course! How Gaga-netic!” Backstage after the show, Jackson gently pulls off one of Ally’s eyebrows and asks her out for a drink. But when she emerges from the dressing room","The film ""A Star Is Born"" is a rare and exceptional Hollywood movie that captures the audience's attention. It stands out as the fourth remake of a story that dates back to 1932, yet it possesses its own unique style and atmosphere. The film takes place in modern times but has a retro '70s vibe, creating a sophisticated and captivating drama. The story revolves around the captivating connection between the two main characters: Jackson Maine, a well-known rock 'n' roll artist struggling with personal demons, played by Bradley Cooper, and Ally, a talented singer-songwriter who becomes his lover and rises to fame on her own, portrayed by Lady Gaga. As she flourishes, he falters, following the classic tragic ""Star Is Born"" concept. However, what sets this movie apart is its ability to delve deep into the emotions of the characters, presenting a heartfelt and revealing narrative. Bradley Cooper, who directed the film and co-wrote the script with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, has done an exceptional job. He fearlessly takes risks by creating scenes that unfold naturally and intimately, without adhering to the usual conventions. ""A Star Is Born"" is not only emotionally captivating but also skillfully convinces the audience to embrace and believe in the complex story it tells. In contrast, the previous 1976 version featuring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson failed to truly capture the essence of the rock world. The love songs in that version felt out of place on the stadium-rock stage, and Streisand herself seemed misplaced, leaving the film feeling campy and awkward. However, the new ""A Star Is Born"" immediately establishes its authenticity and credibility from the very first moments. Jackson, with his rugged appearance and edgy charisma, takes the stage of a massive stadium and delivers a mesmerizing performance that perfectly embodies the rock 'n' roll spirit of the era. The movie effortlessly achieves a sense of truthfulness in its depiction of the music genre, something that is rarely accomplished by Hollywood. Jackson, in his mid-40s, finds himself situated between legendary status and being outdated. Although he still draws large crowds and his old songs have become classics, his sound and image have faded from the mainstream. The irony lies in the fact that his signature look and sound, which once projected authenticity, now appear as showbiz clichés frozen in time. It is a role he continues to play, attempting to preserve his image, all while secretly struggling to keep up. Jackson has a renowned ballad that questions the need to hold on to the past, and it's almost as if he unknowingly foretold his own destiny when he wrote it. In a significant moment, the film transitions from his on-stage success to a vulnerable and exhausted Jackson alone in his car, reaching for his bottle of gin. Cooper masterfully portrays the desperation Jackson feels for his drink, embodying the character's state without resorting to exaggerated drunkenness. He depicts a functioning and charming drunk, his smile and reflexes enhanced by alcohol. Jackson's deep, deliberate Southern accent, infused with the remnants of his alcohol consumption, adds even more dimension to his character. Craving another drink, he instructs his driver to take him to the nearest bar, which happens to be a roadside dive hosting drag-queen karaoke night. Despite the unusual setting, Jackson doesn't mind, as he is always recognized wherever he goes. In this state of contentment, he watches as Ally, the only non-drag performer of the night, takes the stage. With her unique appearance, adorned in heavy makeup, exaggerated eyebrows, and extravagant hair, she captivates the audience with her rendition of ""La Vie en Rose."" Backstage, Jackson removes one of Ally's eyebrows and invites her for a drink, marking the beginning of their relationship.",paraphrase_generation

While we may have seen Johnson in some pretty intimate positions on-screen, there’s definitely a lot we don’t know about the Fifty Shades star. Like, for instance, the superfluity of familiar names in her family tree. Seeing that her popular movie, Fifty Shades Darker came out on the day of love—Valentine's Day—it's only fitting to dedicate a piece to the actress who brought us the sexy and quaint, Anastasia Steele. Johnson, after all, has become somewhat something of a Valentine’s Day staple, herself. Here are 15 facts about Dakota Johnson or, as some might call her, ""that girl from Fifty Shades of Grey."" We guarantee that she will no longer by ""that girl"" by the end of the list! 15 Her Family Tree Is Full Of Famous Faces You know how we said there are a few familiar names in her family tree? Well, we weren’t lying. Her parents are fellow actors, Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. Unfortunately, her parents divorced in 1994 so Dakota had to split her time between the two. ""It was the only way that I could be with them,"" she said in an interview for Cosmopolitan. ""And since they were divorced, I would spend two weeks with one and two weeks with the other, traveling with a tutor."" But wait, it gets better. Her maternal grandmother (can you guess..) is Hitchcock actress Tippi Hedren. Yes, that’s right, so clearly creative talent lies in that family. We’ve never heard of a family tree with so many famous names! Thanksgiving is probably a whirlwind. Now, Dakota Johnson is another famous name in that tree. 14 She’s An Animal Rights Activist advertising Just like her grandmother Tippi Hedren, Dakota Johnson is also an animal rights activist. Like grandmother, like granddaughter shall we say? As animal lovers ourselves, we’re pleased to hear that she’s following in her grandmother’s footsteps—both in acting and in animal rights. In 2014, Johnson saved 12 horses from being slaughtered by paying for them. What a sweet thing to do! We bet her grandmother was really proud. It’s always so great to hear about celebrities doing positive things - so naturally, we’re happy to hear of Dakota’s compassionate side. We admit we have a soft spot for animal lovers, but who doesn't? We always love hearing about people doing good deeds for animals and it’s always nice to hear celebrities using their celebrity title for the better. 13 She Grew Up Shooting Guns And Riding Horses In Colorado She may play the innocent and naive Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades movies, but growing up Johnson was anything but naive. She grew up in Colorado at her dad’s house, where she learned to build a fire, ride a horse, ride motorbikes, and even shoot a gun. And this was all before she was just 10 years old! Sounds like a badass kid to us! But when she wasn’t at her father’s house, she was at her mom’s house in L.A. which she also loved. It's hard to imagine a 10 year old these days shooting guns, riding motorbikes, or building fires without being grounded. But it sounds like she had a pretty inspiring and freeing childhood which makes us fall for the actress all the more. 12 She Never Dates advertising By the header, we mean she never has casual relationships. She only has long-term relationships. Good for her, is all we can say! You hear of so many celebrities who are constantly dating other celebrities. You can barely keep up with who they’re dating these days. It seems to be one guy or girl after another. So it’s great to hear of Dakota’s conservative views on relationships. Apparently she’s only ever been in long-term, serious relationships; she doesn’t just date. That probably explains why she’s been in a relationship with model Matthew Hitt since 2014. Yes, it’s been a kind of an on-and-off relationship but they’ve been in it for the long haul so far. So, to sum up, we like her whole dating attitude.

Okay, so maybe not all of you hated school - many of you probably loved school or at least thrived at school. But most of us can say with the utmost certainty that we hated school with a passion. We all have our reasons why. Johnson, for instance, hated school because she felt like an ""alien."" She said she didn’t understand the process of school as a child and felt ""suffocated."" I don't know about you guys, but I can totally relate with Dakota on this. Many of us felt like we didn’t really fit in at school so it’s especially comforting to hear that a big name like Dakota Johnson also felt like a social outcast in class. Like many of us, she preferred hanging out with her friends than going to school. But hey, we admire her honesty. 10 Auditioning Gives Her Panic Attacks advertising Watching the pristine-looking A-list celebrities gliding around the Golden Globes Award ceremony is enough to wreck your mind with self-doubt over their unbelievably high levels of confidence and self esteem. If only we could possess as much poise! The truth is, many of these celebrities don’t feel that way at all; confident and self assured, that is. Dakota Johnson, for example, gets so nervous during auditions that she often has panic attacks. And we’re not just talking a bit of breathlessness here and there, we’re talking full-on panic attacks—the real deal. So before you come to your conclusions that the celebrities you see on television and in magazines are way more confident than you’ll ever be, just remember something: every single one of them suffers from self-doubt at one point or another. It happens to all of","Dakota Johnson, the actress known for her role in Fifty Shades of Grey, has a lot more to her than what meets the eye on screen. Her family tree is full of famous faces, including her parents Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson, and her maternal grandmother, Tippi Hedren.

Despite playing the innocent Anastasia Steele in Fifty Shades, Johnson grew up in Colorado where she learned to shoot guns, ride horses, and build fires. When it comes to dating, Johnson prefers long-term relationships over casual ones. She has been in an on-and-off relationship with model Matthew Hitt since 2014.

Her portrayal as a drug addict in ""The Town"" showcases the clash of Boston accents reminiscent of ""Bride Wars"". Similarly, her performance in ""The Age of Adaline"" as a perpetually youthful woman feels peculiar, like witnessing a mermaid ride a bicycle. She makes an effort, but her acting has not yet reached the level of her artificially created beauty. Unfortunately, there may not be an algorithmic solution for that. Consequently, I was not particularly excited about the idea of seeing her tremble on a buoy, stitch her own wounds, communicate with animals, or portray a Nancy. While it is refreshing to observe her on a surfboard, this freshness also provides some perspective. While certain actors make sense on the big screen, others might be better suited for a product label, such as beer, beans, or even air. I can hear those who doubt Hudson's talent. All I can say is that the heart desires what it desires. I would actually purchase any product that features Ms. Hudson on its label.

When model Tati Neves, 26, was asked if she kissed the Baby singer , she coyly answered: ""What do you think, if I was sleeping in the bedroom, just me and him?""  That really clears it up then.  Before the interview on Brazilian TV the model allegedly told friends she saw Bieber smoke weed and spent the night with him.  On Globo TV's Fantastico she was asked if she saw a bevy of girls arrive at 3am the same night, believed to bussed in from a nearby club, she replied: ""No. So, I'd already gone into the bedroom with him.""  She also claimed she had taken the video of Bieber asleep, with his beloved baseball cap nearby, the following morning after waking up first.  (Image: Youtube)  She said: ""I was sleeping, and woke up, he was sleeping and I was speaking with a girlfriend.""  Tati, who appears naked on some adult Brazilian websites, is thought to have met Bieber in the Centaurus club in Rio which is notorious for being a brothel.  But Marcus Mion, the owner of the Zax Club in the Barra da Tijuca neighborhood, disputed the model's account.  He said Ms Neves wasn't among the 30 girls the singer chose to go back with him to his rented villa.  (Image: Youtube)  He said: ""I know all the girls who went. I personally went round asking inviting them on behalf of Justin, and I put each one in the van that took them there.""  Two girls were pictured leaving the club with Bieber, although his aides insist he thought it was a private members’ club.  Bieber has now left Brazil and is in Argentina on the South America leg of his world tour.

Tati, who appears naked on some adult Brazilian websites, is thought to have met Bieber in the Centaurus club in Rio which is notorious for being a brothel.  But Marcus Mion, the owner of the Zax Club in the Barra da Tijuca neighborhood, disputed the model's account.  He said Ms Neves wasn't among the 30 girls the singer chose to go back with him to his rented villa.  (Image: Youtube)  He said: ""I know all the girls who went. I personally went round asking inviting them on behalf of Justin, and I put each one in the van that took them there.""  Two girls were pictured leaving the club with Bieber, although his aides insist he thought it was a private members’ club.

gossipcop-6722352082,"Carlotta is a fictional character from Gaston Leroux's 1909 novel The Phantom of the Opera.  In the novel, she is a minor character hailing from Spain. The first time that she is mentioned in the novel is during the chapter ""The New Marguerite"", where it is revealed that she could not perform at the ceremony for the former managers. Later in the novel, she is threatened by Erik that if she performs at the Opera House ""a great misfortune will strike"". She shrugs the warning off and performs anyway. When she does, however, croaking noises come out of her mouth and the chandelier comes crashing down. Ashamed, she hides from the public view for a few weeks, before making a return to the opera house.  Carlotta is portrayed by Virginia Pearson in the original 1925 silent film with Lon Chaney. In 1929, new sound scenes were filmed and Mary Fabian was recast as Carlotta, due to the fact that she could sing. Virginia Pearson still appeared in new scenes, now playing Carlotta's mother. These changes are also the same in the 1929 silent, foreign cut of the film (which is most commonly viewed).  In the 1943 film version, she is Mme. Biancarolli who has been drugged by the Phantom and murdered along with her maid when she tries to force him to take off his prop mask.  In Andrew Lloyd Webber's production, Carlotta (last name Giudicelli) is from Italy and is one of the major singing parts. The opera company's prima donna, she despises Christine Daaé and sees the younger woman as a threat to her job and Phantom´s courtesan, when Christine achieves prominence due to the Phantom's dirty tricks. Carlotta and tenor Ubaldo Piangi are lovers; she often turns to him for consolation when things go wrong, and she breaks down crying when his murdered body is discovered onstage. The film reveals that she likes poodles.  In the Lloyd Webber-Joel Schumacher 2004 film version, she was played by Minnie Driver.[1] Due to Driver's lack of experience in opera, her singing voice was dubbed by opera singer Margaret Preece, although she lent her actual voice to the song ""Learn to Be Lonely"" during the end credits.  In Nicholas Meyer's novel The Canary Trainer, the characters of Carlotta and La Sorelli are combined into one, despite being mentioned as separate characters in the original novel.

gossipcop-178000221,"Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.

Iggy Azalea, 26, knows a lot about heartbreak when it comes to dealing with men. Especially, those who are still connected to their exes. That said, The New Classic artist is trying to get word to Khloe Kardashian, 32, that Tristan Thompson, 25, may break her heart if she’s not careful.  “Iggy’s not trying to be salty or hate on Tristan but she’s hit up French [Montana], and told her he needs to put Khloe up on game and warn her that she’s putting herself at risk for serious heartbreak with him,” a source close to Iggy told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “Iggy explained to French that these basketball players are no joke and don’t care whose heart they break in their quest to bang every girl that breathes.”  “Iggy still feels some type of way after Nick [Young] cheated on her and then on top of that got his baby mama pregnant – again,” the source continued. “She’s sticking to the girl code and would hate for Khloe to experience the same type of pain she did. She’s hoping French gets to her before it’s too late.”  As HollywoodLife.com previously reported, it’s really hard for KoKo to ignore the rumors that TT and his baby mama, Jordy Craig, are still hooking up. In fact, we’re told Khloe’s hired some private eyes to keep tabs on her dude. “She loves Tristan wholeheartedly and he’s been nothing but a stand-up, loving man,” another source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “But she can’t help but worry sometimes. Khloe spends as much time in Cleveland as possible and has spies in every city his team plays in.”  HollywoodLifers, do you think Khloe will listen to Iggy?","Iggy Azalea is concerned about Khloe Kardashian's relationship with Tristan Thompson and wants to warn her about the potential for heartbreak. Iggy has reached out to French Montana to ask him to talk to Khloe and inform her about the risks of getting involved with basketball players who may not be serious about commitment. Iggy is speaking from personal experience, having dealt with her own heartbreak when her ex, Nick Young, cheated on her and got another woman pregnant. Iggy is hoping that Khloe will listen to her advice and not go through the same pain she did. Khloe, meanwhile, has hired private investigators to keep an eye on Tristan and his alleged connection with his ex, Jordy Craig. While Khloe loves Tristan and considers him a loving partner, she can't help but have her worries. The question remains if Khloe will heed Iggy's warning.",paraphrase_generation

We’ve got the pics of their steamy Mexican getaway  Rihanna has kept her one year romance with Saudi billionaire Hassan Jameel super private. So when rumors surfaced in June that they had broken up fans were waiting to see proof they were still a couple. They got it on July 9 when pics surfaced of the 30-year-old singer and the businessman on a sexy Mexican getaway. The two appeared to be locked in a animated conversation as bikini clad RiRi is seen pointing her right index finger in the air with her mouth open, looking like she had something important to say. In another pic Hassan is seen looking back at her with his hand on his chest as if they’re involved in a somewhat heated conversation. CLICK HERE to see all the pics.  On June 1 MediaTakeOut claimed RiRi had dumped Hassan. The site reported that “Rihanna just got tired of him. She gets tired of men sometimes,” an alleged insider told them. They said that the handsome billionaire wasn’t doing too well after the split. “Of course Rihanna broke his heart. That’s what she does — break men’s hearts.” Since Rihanna has never commented on her romance with Hassan and goes to great lengths to keep their relationship away from the public eye, MTO’s report spread like wildfire.  Obviously something is still on between Rihanna and Hassan, as they are having a hot summer together. They were first photographed a year ago making out in a pool in Spain. They’ve only been pictured a handful of times since, keeping their love undercover. The “Work” singer’s previous relationship was with Drake, 31, and it played out in public. He even professed his years of love to her in front of the world while presenting her with the Video Vanguard award at the 2016 VMAs. After having the public know all about their dating business, Ri has wisely kept her romance with Hassan as far out of the public eye as possible.

gossipcop-6909849467,"Now, it’s official: Star Wars fans will have one final chance to say goodbye to Carrie Fisher, with Lucasfilm announcing that the actress, who died in December 2016, will appear in next year’s Star Wars: Episode IX.  In a statement, director J.J. Abrams sought to put concerns about potential CGI resurrections to rest, saying that the new movie will use “unseen footage we shot together in Episode VII” and assuring fans that “we were never going to recast, or use a CG character.” While this is, undoubtedly, comforting, it would also appear to offer particular clues about the role Fisher — or, more specifically, her character, Leia Organa — will play in the movie.  Firstly: Purely for practical purposes, Leia’s presence in the movie will be small. If nothing else, there can’t be that much extraneous, unseen footage from 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens; she was barely in that movie, so unless large swaths of scenes were shot but never even hinted at by anyone involved in the production, there’s limited material to draw from in the first place, and surely not everything available will be used.  Considering the context of the footage, it also limits the potential use for Episode IX. Leia appeared in few scenes and locations in The Force Awakens. Leia was on Takodana, rescuing Han, Chewbacca, Rey and Finn, and then at the Resistance base on D’Qar, where she takes part in planning, and later monitoring, the attack on Starkiller Base. Aside from brief interludes with Han and, later, Rey, she’s very much in “harried leader” mode throughout the movie. Does this mean that this is the Leia we’ll see in Episode IX, even after losing her ex-husband, and then her brother, in the previous two movies?  (It’s possible that the Fisher footage will end up being just a minor flashback, used to punctuate a contemporary moment; memories during her funeral, as some on social media have already suggested. If so, then the above problem is side-stepped, to a degree.)  Abrams’ comments leave space for some level of postproduction trickery to be applied to the Fisher footage. Presumably, Fisher will be intercut with new footage of actors shot specifically for Episode IX. Will digital trickery be used to make sure that Fisher shares a location with the other cast members? If so, will that be all that’s altered? What about costuming choices? For that matter, what about the potential for posthumous dubbing or soundalikes used for dialogue where Leia is off-camera or not in close-up? Abrams said that the movie would never use a CG character, but what about a performance augmented or altered by CG?  Of course, if any such edits or alterations are made, they’ll have to be done with subtlety and sensitivity. This is key to the entire enterprise of including footage of Fisher posthumously. For as much as fans want to be able to say goodbye to the actress, and also to Leia, they want to do so in a manner that feels appropriate and respectful to both. While Abrams and Lucasfilm — and Fisher’s family, especially daughter Billie Lourd, named in Abrams’ statement — want to provide both closure and tribute to Leia and Fisher alike with this move, they’re courting backlash if this isn’t done perfectly.  That the footage will come from The Force Awakens feels particularly fitting, then; that, after all, was a project that already came with expectations and looming accusations from fandom expecting the worst. It’s also perhaps a reminder that those involved with this move love the mythology — and loved Fisher as a person — as much as anyone else, if not more so, and will be approaching it with the utmost care.  Everyone will, inevitably, remain worried until the final product appears onscreen, but perhaps we can rest just slightly in the meantime.",1,en,"Now, it’s official: Star Wars fans will have one final chance to say goodbye to Carrie Fisher, with Lucasfilm announcing that the actress, who died in December 2016, will appear in next year’s Star Wars: Episode IX.

Everyone will, inevitably, remain worried until the final product appears onscreen, but perhaps we can rest just slightly in the meantime.","Lucasfilm has officially announced that the late Carrie Fisher will make an appearance in the upcoming Star Wars: Episode IX, giving fans one last opportunity to bid farewell to the beloved actress. Director J.J. Abrams assured fans that the movie will utilize previously unseen footage of Fisher from Episode VII, debunking any concerns about CGI resurrections or recasting. However, given the limited amount of unused footage available, it is likely that Leia's role in the movie will be relatively small. The context of the footage suggests that Leia will continue to embody her role as a determined leader, despite the losses she has suffered in the previous films. There is speculation that the Fisher footage may be used in flashbacks or during funeral scenes, which would alleviate some of the challenges in incorporating her into the plot. Abrams' statement also raises questions about the extent of postproduction alterations that may be applied to the Fisher footage. While he emphasized the avoidance of computer-generated characters, it remains to be seen if certain modifications, such as digital trickery or posthumous dubbing, will be utilized. Nonetheless, any edits or alterations must be executed with subtlety and sensitivity to maintain the appropriate tone and respect for Fisher's legacy. The decision to source the footage from The Force Awakens is fitting, as it aligns with the project's pre-existing expectations and the careful handling of fan reactions. It also serves as a testament to the deep appreciation and affection that those involved in the production have for the Star Wars mythology and for Fisher herself. Although concerns will inevitably persist until the final product is revealed, there is some reassurance in the knowledge that the filmmakers are approaching this endeavor with the utmost care.",paraphrase_generation

A replica of the world’s most famous “unsinkable” ship — which struck an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912, killing 1,503 people — is under construction, with a maiden voyage planned for 2018.

More importantly, it will carry enough lifeboats for every passenger and its hull will be welded, not riveted, just in case it comes across a rogue iceberg, the Belfast Telegraph reports.  “The new Titanic will of course have modern evacuation procedures, satellite controls, digital navigation and radar systems and all those things you’d expect on a 21st-century ship,” James McDonald, global marketing director of Palmer’s company, Blue Star Line, told the paper.  The new nine-deck ship will be 885 feet long, about two more than her doomed predecessor, 174 feet high and have a maximum speed of 24 knots.

gossipcop-2509430407,"Are wedding bells in the future for Mariah Carey? The iconic singer reportedly popped the question to her bae, Bryan Tanaka, and the two are busy planning their big day!  Did Mariah Carey, 47, have a vision of love when looking at boyfriend Bryan Tanaka, 34, one that left her feeling all sorts of emotions? After deciding that she just can’t let go of this hunk, Mariah reportedly decided to make it happen – an engagement, that is! “Word is Mariah took matters into her own hands,” a source tells OK! magazine, “It was an unusual proposal but it did the trick. She wrote a song about how she wanted Bryan to be her husband and she performed it for him while wearing a sexy, glitzy gown. Then she explained that she’s ready for them to make their relationship official.”  Bryan gave a “hearty yes,” as the insider says, “He couldn’t believe his luck!” It appears Bryan also thinks he and Mariah belong together, and he always wants to be her baby. These two aren’t waiting around for one sweet day to tie the knot. While love takes time, Mariah and Bryan are already busy making wedding plans. “Mariah would love to get married in May at the Grand Wailea Resort in Maui,” the insider told OK!, “where she and Bryan first went public with their romance.” Mariah and Bryan struck up a relationship in late 2016, with Mariah low-key confirming the romance in February 2017 by calling Bryan her “boyfriend.”  Mariah’s “also toying with the idea of a winter wonderland wedding,” the source says. “After all, she is the queen of Christmas!” Could Mariah have the fantasy holiday wedding she’s always wanted, saying “Thank God I found you” to her honey, her all? Whenever Mariah decides to get married, don’t forget about us when it comes to the wedding invitations!  This alleged engagement would be the third time Mariah walked down the aisle, as she was previously married to Tommy Mottola, 68, and Nick Cannon, 37. After dealing with a pair of heartbreakers, MiMi isn’t fooling around, especially when it comes to her $520 million fortune. She’s working on an ironclad prenup, according to OK! magazine. “She’s had tow failed marriages already,” the source says. “She’s not going to take any risks here.” Speaking of Nick, expect to see him during Mariah’s big day.  Nick and Mariah’s twins – son Morocco and daughter Monroe, 6 – will be featured in his wedding, and sources say Mariah’s thinking of asking Nick to walk her down the aisle. “[He] will always be a big part of her life,” the source added. Considering Mariah, Nick and the twins recently made an adorable appearance at the 2018 Kids’ Choice Awards, it makes total sense that Mariah’s ex would be on hand to see her say “I Do” again.",1,en,"Are wedding bells in the future for Mariah Carey?

gossipcop-8581615474,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.

T","Katie Holmes is facing difficulties in her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise, and daughter Suri, according to numerous reports. RadarOnline claims that Holmes and Foxx were on the brink of getting married in an extravagant ceremony worth $300,000, with Suri as her bridesmaid. However, Foxx's commitment issues and his friendly relationship with his ex-girlfriend and mother of his daughter ultimately led to the cancellation of the wedding. Holmes felt disrespected by Foxx's behavior and realized it wasn't healthy for her or Suri. Additionally, Cruise has been trying to regain a presence in Suri's life, which Holmes is hesitant about due to her agreement for Cruise to stay away from their daughter and not involve her in the Church of Scientology. Holmes, however, is starting to consider a reunion for the sake of Suri's happiness. Despite denials from Holmes' representatives, it is significant that her publicist openly acknowledged their relationship, which they had tried to keep secret for years due to legal obligations from Holmes' divorce settlement with Cruise. Speculation arose when Holmes and Foxx were spotted together after the alleged five-year dating ban ended.",paraphrase_generation
