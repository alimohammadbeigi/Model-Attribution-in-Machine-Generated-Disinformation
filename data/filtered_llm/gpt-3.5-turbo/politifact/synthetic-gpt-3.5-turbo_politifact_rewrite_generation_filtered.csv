During a speech, he referred to the Civil War as the ""War of Northern Aggression"" and referred to President Obama as a ""fake president"" and Attorney General Eric Holder as ""rabidly un-American."" However, his most concerning remarks were made at a press conference, where he stated, ""We need to defend our God-given rights. No more northern folk trying to take away what is rightfully ours.

According to reports, the Obama administration has been covertly establishing strategic complexes located outside of major cities and across two uninhabited islands, which has raised concerns among citizens and officials alike. It is believed that these facilities are outfitted with advanced technology and equipment for spying and surveillance. Moreover, there have been reports of secret meetings being held by Obama with high-ranking officials and diplomats from around the world, all within the confines of a hidden mansion known to be a part of the historic Washington tunnel system, allegedly built after the British burned down the White House in 1812. While the exact reach and extent of these tunnels is unknown, several sources have identified Tracey Place, among other buildings that house public officials in the area.

She wrote on her website, “Be aware! Dictatorship exists in all countries but with different tactics! They only care for personal and short-term pr","During the recent reporting of the shooting at YouTube headquarters, some liberal news channels fell short of journalistic integrity. While many media outlets focused on driving a narrative, a San Francisco Bay Area resident and employee of YouTube spoke truthfully about his thoughts during the incident. When asked what was going through his mind, the witness stated, “I knew I had to be smart. You gotta be smart, you gotta be fast.” The witness also expressed his desire to have a gun, a sentiment that aligns with the constitutional right to bear arms and the intention of our founding fathers.

Reports now confirm that the shooting was a case of domestic violence, and law enforcement officials do not consider it an act of terrorism. However, the question remains about how this woman obtained a gun. California is notably strict in its gun control laws, causing law-abiding citizens to jump through hoops and wait extended periods to purchase firearms, and recently added a permit requirement for purchasing ammunition. Although politicians may believe that banning guns will stop violent criminals from possessing them, the reality is that firearms can be easily obtained in certain areas of the state.

The YouTube shooter has been identified as Nasim Aghdam, a user of the platform who allegedly targeted YouTube for censorship and demonetization of her video content. Aghdam had no relationship with anyone at the YouTube facility and got off 30 or 40 shots before turning the gun on herself. A possible motivation for the shooting was Aghdam’s frustration with changes to YouTube’s platform, which led to declines in viewership and monetization for her content. While Aghdam’s actions were deplorable, her comments about the existence of dictatorship tactics resonate with those who value the principles of free speech and individual liberty.",rewrite_generation

Thanks to Medicaid he’s being treated for cancer. During the CNN town hall with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Kline explained his situation and his struggles. “My question is pretty straightforward,” Kline told Price. “Why do you want to take away my Medicaid expansion?” Price’s dispassionate answer seemed to fall flat on the audience. “I took care of a lot of patients with cancer,” Price explained about his 20 years as an orthopedic surgeon. “We don’t want to take care away from anybody. What we want to make certain, though, is that every single American has access to the kind of coverage and care that they want for themselves.”“But, what if there are people out there who are going to die more quickly because of what you’re doing here, because you’re essentially taking medical care away from people who need it the most?” Kline wouldn’t back down. “Are you saying you actually want people to be okay with that?” Price thought for a second, then replied: “Look, I understand how all of this sounds right now, but you know, there comes a time in everyone’s life when they just have to stop talking B.S. and be practical. As of right now, the fact to the matter is, our national budget is hemorrhaging money because of Obamacare. And believe me – I get how insensitive that sounds, but at the end of the day, we have to stop ignoring the facts here.”He continued, “I understand that this is not something anyone wants to hear, especially people who’ve got worse problems to deal with than the state of the national budget, but this is one of those situations where the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.

Price emphasized that it is time to be practical, and that fixing the national budget is crucial to prevent economic recession. In this difficult situation, the needs of the many outweigh those of the few. While this approach may initially sound insensitive, there are no realistic alternatives. To continue providing insurance to those with pre-existing conditions would only lead to nationwide debt, which the government is not prepared to accept.

It has been reported that US President Donald Trump is considering issuing an executive order to prohibit the use of Facebook in the country. While some Republican leaders have expressed their opposition to the idea of banning an American corporation, President Trump remains firm in his support for the ban as a way to combat the spread of fake news on social media platforms. ""The governance of a nation often involves making difficult decisions,"" explained President Trump. Despite Facebook's efforts to combat fake news, a substantial amount of false information continues to circulate on the platform. Although Twitter and Instagram are exempt from this potential ban, insiders at Facebook are dissatisfied with this selective exclusion. Rick Rowlinson, a source from Facebook, expressed his concern that the President's commitment to tackling fake news should not be limited to one company. In response to the proposed ban, a number of Californians have already taken to the streets in protest.  

It is important to note that courts in the US have previously blocked President Trump's travel ban executive order. However, Vice President Mike Pence has pledged his support for the ban on Facebook if it is enacted. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, has said that his company will continue to operate from California, even if it is banned in the US. He argues that an outright ban is not the most effective way to combat false news. Lastly, employees of Facebook are planning to start a signature campaign against the order if it is approved.

politifact14126,"Breaking News: FBI Uncovers Evidence That 62 Million Trump Voters are All Russian AgentsAnonymous sources within the FBI have revealed to The Times that they have new evidence indicating that everyone who voted for Donald Trump is an agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB).

politifact15031,"Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).The latest USDA data show that the number of participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the government program that administers food stamps, dropped from 45,666,795 in October 2017 to 41,658,868 in November 2017 — a staggering decrease of 4,007,927 over one month.Even though there was a temporary spike in enrollment, mostly concentrated in a few states that caused the national average of food stamp enrollment to spike, nationwide enrollment in the program as a whole is still on a steady decline.Enrollment in the program sharply increased by 3.5 million during the first month of fiscal year (FY) 2018 (October 2017) mostly due to heavy increases in temporary SNAP enrollment in hurricane-affected states such as Florida and Texas.In Florida alone, food stamp participation soared by 2.5 million from September to October due to the state administering Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) benefits to poor residents affected by Hurricane Irma.The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service approved Florida’s request to administer these special D-SNAP benefits beginning September 10, 2017.A spokesperson for Florida’s Department of Children and Families (DCF) — the program that administers food stamp benefits in Florida — confirmed with Breitbart News that the dramatic increase in SNAP enrollment in the state was due to disaster relief, but that most food stamp recipients were not normal beneficiaries of the food stamp program.“The dramatic increase in SNAP recipients in the fall was related to the state’s administration of the federal disaster SNAP program following the impact of Hurricane Irma. To qualify for the federal disaster food assistance program, individuals must have lived or worked in one of the 48 declared counties on September 5, and NOT be a customer in the regular food assistance program,” said DCF Communications Director Jessica Sims.Sims added that DCF handed out D-SNAP benefits totaling more than $1 billion to 3.1 million people in the months following Hurricane Irma, but the state curtailed its D-SNAP benefit program on December 3.The sharp decline in food stamp enrollment over one month reflects how states like Florida have curtailed their temporary food stamp benefit programs for those affected by natural disasters.But it also highlights an ongoing downward trend in food stamp enrollment that has been going on for several years since state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to get people back into the workforce.The Trump administration announced that it would adopt some of these state welfare reform measures — such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a certain number of hours per week — and implement them at the federal level, causing nationwide food stamp enrollment to plunge even further.Over the past year since President Donald Trump took office, enrollment in SNAP dropped by two million.

Customized furniture does come at a premium price, but it is one of those investments you will not lose any sleep over once you are living in your tiny home.Tiny AppliancesEvery piece of furniture and appliance you put into your tiny home, will make you compromise on something else. Tiny living is about downsizing your living space to bare necessities but that has a different meaning for different people. In order to create more space for storing stuff you can’t live without, making some sacrifices when it comes to appliances is important. Instead of a full-sized stove, opt in for a dual heat-plate design that will take up less space. A small refrigerator works fine, just like a large two-door model. Also shopping more frequently for fresh groceries will lead you to a healthier lifestyle and diet. A fold out dinning-table in the kitchen, saves you the space that you might need for a dining table. Tiny appliances and gadgets do tend to have a higher price than standard ones, but they provide so much more than function to tiny home dwellers.","Living in a regular-sized home with ample space for storage may not require much thought on the topic, however, in the realm of tiny homes, storage space is an essential consideration for any future resident. The restriction on space challenged tiny house owners to carefully plan and prepare when constructing, purchasing, or furnishing their home. Simply moving to a smaller residence does not mean one can sacrifice adequate storage space. 

For small homes on the market in Florida, the floor plan is limited, leaving little room to place items on the ground. Homeowners must consider verticality, as wall-mounted shelves provide an excellent solution for storage without sacrificing precious floor space. Furthermore, wall-mounted entertainment systems save valuable space and are easily installed. 

Multi-functional furniture is critical in a tiny house, where a bed should not merely serve as a place to sleep but fulfill other functions, particularly storage. Coffee and night tables, sofas, and kitchen elements must also perform multiple uses, including storage. Incorporating drawers and utilizing the space beneath a mattress provides valuable storage space. It is wise to choose cube-design tables, which integrate storage drawers for small items with no place to go. 

Furnishing a tiny home may present difficulties, particularly when it deviates from a standard floor plan. Customized furniture provides a significant advantage in tiny homes where space is at a premium. Every nook and cranny can be utilized with the proper placement of shelves and lockers, providing crucial functions without requiring much space. Though customized furniture may come at a premium price point, it is a sound investment for those living in tiny homes.

Every appliance and piece of furniture has the potential to limit precious space and require compromise. In order not to sacrifice storing personal items, residents must acknowledge the importance of downsizing. A dual heat-plate stove serves a similar function as a full-sized one and takes up less space, while a small refrigerator provides ample storage for grocery essentials. To avoid requiring a dining table, a kitchen featuring a fold-out dining table offers a creative solution to save space. Although tiny appliances may be more expensive than standard ones, they offer many benefits to those residing in tiny homes.",rewrite_generation

politifact14128,"Workers in New Orleans dismantled the city’s Jefferson Davis monument early Thursday, removing the prominent statue of the Confederate leader that had stood for more than 100 years.As workers slung a strap around the statue’s waist and lifted it off its pedestal, at least 100 people cheered from across the street, outnumbering the few dozen protesters of the removal, some waving Confederate flags.“This historic moment is an opportunity to join together as one city and redefine our future,” Mayor Mitch Landrieu said as he announced that crews had begun removing the statue, the second of four planned removals of Confederacy-related monuments.The Mayor also made an announcement that the statue would be replaced with a bronze statue of the 44th President Barack Obama.“It will be nice”, Landrieu said, “to see a monument to our first African-American President in the same spot that used to be a place to memorialize old racist White privilege.”The Obama statue will be patterned after one erected in Kenya last year and will reportedly cost the Louisana taxpayers an estimated $800,000 dollars.Like an earlier removal, this one was performed in the dark because of death threats against city officials and contractors.Beaureguard Billy-Bob Johnson, one of the leaders of the opposition was outraged by not only the statue being taken down but the fact that it occurred in the middle of the night.“We would have preferred it to be in the daytime,” Johnson said, “so everybody could see what they are doing the light of day. And I really hate coming downtown at night with all the darkies afoot and everything.”Before the monument could be removed, police had to clear the immediate area of demonstrators — both supporters of the monuments and those who want them taken away. Barricades were used to keep the sides separated, NOLA.com reported.

As the statue was carefully lifted from its pedestal, a group of around one hundred people cheered from across the street and outnumbered the few dozen protestors of the removal, some of whom waved Confederate flags.

Mayor Mitch Landrieu saw this as an historic moment, and spoke to those gathered about the need to see it as an opportunity to redefine the city’s future. This removal marks the second of four planned removals of Confederacy-related monuments, and sets a precedent for future action.

One aspect of this new direction is the decision to replace the Davis statue with one of former President Barack Obama, a bronze statue that will cost the state an estimated $800,000. Landrieu has stated that this decision will serve to replace a monument to racist white privilege with one that honors the first African-American president of the United States.

Despite the importance of this moment, there were some in opposition to the removal and the way in which it was accomplished. One group of protestors was unhappy that the removal took place in the middle of the night, due to death threats against city officials and contractors. Another group supported the monuments and voiced their opposition. Police worked to keep the sides separated, using barricades to clear the immediate area.

This moment will be remembered in the history of New Orleans and the country, and sets the precedent for the ongoing work that is needed to redefine our communities and our values.",rewrite_generation
politifact15280,"A leaked Hillary Clinton email confirms that the Obama administration, with Hillary at the helm, orchestrated a civil war in Syria to benefit Israel.The new Wikileaks release shows the then Secretary of State ordering a war in Syria in order to overthrow the government and oust President Assad, claiming it was the “best way to help Israel”.Newobserveronline.com reports:The document was one of many unclassified by the US Department of State under case number F-2014-20439, Doc No. C05794498, following the uproar over Clinton’s private email server kept at her house while she served as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013.Although the Wikileaks transcript dates the email as December 31, 2000, this is an error on their part, as the contents of the email (in particular the reference to May 2012 talks between Iran and the west over its nuclear program in Istanbul) show that the email was in fact sent on December 31, 2012.The email makes it clear that it has been US policy from the very beginning to violently overthrow the Syrian government—and specifically to do this because it is in Israel’s interests.“The best way to help Israel deal with Iran’s growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad,” Clinton forthrightly starts off by saying.Even though all US intelligence reports had long dismissed Iran’s “atom bomb” program as a hoax (a conclusion supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency), Clinton continues to use these lies to “justify” destroying Syria in the name of Israel.She specifically links Iran’s mythical atom bomb program to Syria because, she says, Iran’s “atom bomb” program threatens Israel’s “monopoly” on nuclear weapons in the Middle East.If Iran were to acquire a nuclear weapon, Clinton asserts, this would allow Syria (and other “adversaries of Israel” such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt) to “go nuclear as well,” all of which would threaten Israel’s interests.Therefore, Clinton, says, Syria has to be destroyed.Iran’s nuclear program and Syria’s civil war may seem unconnected, but they are. What Israeli military leaders really worry about — but cannot talk about — is losing their nuclear monopoly.An Iranian nuclear weapons capability would not only end that nuclear monopoly but could also prompt other adversaries, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to go nuclear as well. The result would be a precarious nuclear balance in which Israel could not respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on Syria and Lebanon, as it can today.If Iran were to reach the threshold of a nuclear weapons state, Tehran would find it much easier to call on its allies in Syria and Hezbollah to strike Israel, knowing that its nuclear weapons would serve as a deterrent to Israel responding against Iran itself.It is, Clinton continues, the “strategic relationship between Iran and the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria” that makes it possible for Iran to undermine Israel’s security.This would not come about through a “direct attack,” Clinton admits, because “in the thirty years of hostility between Iran and Israel” this has never occurred, but through its alleged “proxies.”The end of the Assad regime would end this dangerous alliance.

This information was leaked via an email which had been unclassified by the US Department of State, under case number F-2014-20439, Doc No. C05794498, following controversy over Clinton’s private email server usage during her tenure as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013. Although the email as transcribed by Wikileaks dates the message as December 31, 2000, this is an error as its content, particularly the mention of the May 2012 Iran-west talks about the nuclear program in Istanbul, indicates that it was sent on December 31, 2012. 

The email largely discusses how the US had the long-standing policy of overthrowing the Syrian government and deposing President Bashar Assad, with Clinton insisting that this was in the interest of Israel. According to her, it was the best way to help Israel deal with Iran’s perceived nuclear program threat, even though all US intelligence reports had long dismissed the idea of Iran having atomic bombs as a hoax, a conclusion also backed by the International Atomic Energy Agency.

Clinton further connects Iran’s purported nuclear program with Israel’s concern that its monopoly on nuclear weapons in the Middle East could be threatened. She notes that if Iran were to acquire nuclear weapons, a precarious nuclear balance would emerge in the region, making it difficult for Israel to respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on Syria and Lebanon. It would also become easier for Iran to call on its supposed allies in Syria and Hezbollah to attack Israel, as its nuclear weapons would act as a deterrent against Israeli retaliation.

Clinton posits that the “strategic relationship between Iran and the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria” made it possible for Iran to potentially undermine Israel’s security not through a direct attack, but using its proxies. She asserts that bringing down Assad would end this dangerous alliance and also ease Israel’s fear of losing its nuclear monopoly, thus allowing Israel and the US to agree on when the Iranian nuclear program reached a dangerous level.

Clinton concludes by stating that directly threatening Assad and his family with violence is the right thing to do, as it is the only way to change his mind and end the conflict. She suggests that this action would not only benefit Israel’s security but also assist in easing the mounting tension that had arisen with Israel over Iran. 

Overall, the email provides a clear window into the US policymakers’ thinking on Syria and Israel. While the language used may be provocative, it reflects a serious and measured attempt at assessing the region’s chain reaction to various scenarios.",rewrite_generation

It should come as no surprise that Obama chose to leave the country right now, however, as the heat was just turned up on his deep state after the firing of now former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.In the wake of this firing, it was confirmed that Obama left behind a trail of damning evidence inside the Oval Office. The evidence proves that it was actually the Obama administration that colluded with Russia to thwart then-candidate Donald Trump during the presidential election, and they didn’t cover their tracks well enough.The members of Obama’s deep state that took part in this plan included ormer FBI Director James Comey, former National Security Advisor Susan Rice, former UN Ambassador Samantha Powers, and Lisa Monaco, who was the head of the DOJ National Security Division. Monaco slipped up and left an evidence trail going from the illegal unmasking of US citizens being done, Trump and his campaign people, under the illegal FISA warrants, back to the Oval Office via the “Presidential Daily Briefings” (PDB).“During the 2015/2016 presidential election, Lisa Monaco was one of the key WH figures doing the unmasking of raw intelligence provided by the ‘small group’ collaborators (with Susan Rice, Ben Rhodes). Monaco was also one of the key policy strategists, heck, she was the architect, who utilized the compartmentalization of intelligence to hide the fingerprints of collaboration. This was the issue that initially stymied HSPCI Devin Nunes,” reported The Conservative Treehouse.Nunes eventually found Obama’s PDBs which have all the illegal FISA activity and other illegal spy games targeting Trump.“Nunes stated the intelligence product he reviewed was ‘not related to Russia, or the FBI Russian counter-intelligence investigation.’ So the product itself was likely a product for the President, that was not part of the ongoing FBI counter-intel product,” reported The Conservative Treehouse.These PDBs prove Obama was in on this from the very beginning, and he hasn’t stopped trying to take Trump down since then. Last month, Obama and his deep state set up a website called “National Security Action,” who says their mission is, “Under President Trump’s reckless leadership, the United States is weaker in the world, less safe, and more isolated. He is retreating from the world stage, undercutting the intelligence and law enforcement agencies that keep us safe, undermining the diplomacy that prevents wars, insulting our allies, attacking democratic traditions, and cozying up to dictators while abandoning America’s commitment to universal rights and human dignity.”These people are just trying to get Trump impeached so they can swoop in and take back the White House as soon as he is out of it.

Let us know your thoughts in the comments section.","Former United States President Barack Obama has reportedly flown to New Zealand. This comes after the firing of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, which has put the spotlight back on the ""deep state"" conspiracy theory, among other things. According to reports, President Donald Trump has claimed that Obama left behind damning evidence that proves that it was the Obama administration that colluded with Russia to undermine current President Trump's campaign during the presidential election. Former FBI Director James Comey, former National Security Advisor Susan Rice, former UN Ambassador Samantha Powers, and Lisa Monaco, who was the head of the Department of Justice (DOJ) National Security Division, have all been implicated in this plan. Monaco is believed to have mistakenly left a trail of evidence involving the illegal unmasking of US citizens and the Trump campaign team under illegal FISA warrants, which led back to the Oval Office through Presidential Daily Briefings (PDB). Devin Nunes, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, eventually found Obama's PDBs, which show the extent of illegal FISA activity, as well as other illegal spy games targeting Trump. The Conservative Treehouse reports that these PDBs prove that Obama was involved in the plan from the very beginning, and he has continued to work against President Trump since then. Obama and his group have even set up a website called ""National Security Action,"" whose aim is reportedly to get Trump impeached so they can take over the White House once he's out of it. However, McCabe's firing has put a damper on their plans and has made it clear that they cannot get away with committing acts of treason.",rewrite_generation

Recently, Obama attempted to fly under an alias, ""Bruce Wilekenmeyer,"" from Toronto International Airport but was stopped at a checkpoint by a CRMP officer who recognized him despite his disguise. He was taken into custody and turned over to the US Embassy. Obama was transported back to Washington, where he was brought before a special session of US District Court and formally charged. He was then released into his attorney's custody with an order restricting him from leaving the country. Photography, video, and any other recording devices are generally prohibited in federal courtrooms, but a court reporter who also works for Breitbart managed to capture a photo of Obama in court, revealing that he had also dyed his hair to conceal his identity.

She has been a vocal opponent of President Trump and has led the push for investigations into Russian collusion claims, despite having no concrete evidence to support her claims. However, her recent revelation of missing Congressional meetings has added fuel to the fire, sparking anger from her own constituents.

Informed Reddit user, 1tch, has done an extensive analysis and gathered the facts to reveal that Ms. Waters has missed an astonishing 90% of Congressional meetings during her 35-year career. This raises serious questions about her commitment to serving the people who elected her, and her ability to deliver on the promises she made.

While she may have been known as a champion for social justice in some circles, Ms. Waters has been accused by others of ""peddling race baiting, socialist agendas, and a hatred for the President,"" all while achieving little success in her career. Her behavior towards constituents has also been called into question, as she was filmed being rude to one of her own voters.

Perhaps most concerning is her belief that as a woman of color, she is immune from impeachment. Her focus on skin color over substance has left her with little to offer her constituents and, as a result, she has resorted to using her minority status as a basis for her campaigns.

Despite her wealth and status, Ms. Waters has failed to represent her district well, and many of her constituents have made this clear by gathering outside her million-dollar estate to show her their frustration.

The reality is that Waters is a loud but unproductive member of the swamp, and the recent news about her attendance record has only confirmed this. Perhaps it's time for her to focus on the job she was elected to do, and spend more time being held accountable to the people who put her in office.",rewrite_generation

That isn’t stopping him, however, from nicking their wallets in the new tax law that he is expected to sign in early January.Buried in the hastily drafted tax bill’s more than 500 pages are provisions eliminating “miscellaneous” deductions taken by almost 28 million taxpayers in 2015. Those are costs you bore to support your job or an investment you own or to pay a professional to prepare your income tax return.This year cops and other first responders can write off the costs of buying uniforms and dry cleaning them. But in 2018, cops who buy their uniforms or are required to buy their own guns and ammunition will no longer be able to deduct those costs as reasonable and necessary expenses to support their earning a paycheck, thanks to Trump and Congressional Republicans.But that’s not all. Cops and anyone else who belongs to a union will no longer be allowed to deduct their union dues. People who must bear travel costs without reimbursement from their employers will just have to suck it up starting in January.Add police officers, the military, teachers, nurses and first responders to the long, long list of hard working Americans that Donald Trump and the Republican party want to make suffer. And all to give the wealthiest among us more wealth.Shameful.","The recently passed tax bill has been widely regarded as one of the most ill-conceived pieces of legislation in the history of American politics. This opinion has been shared by experts and politicians alike, including Paul Ryan. It is no secret that the bill has been deeply unpopular and will be forever linked to the current sitting President, with the exception of a minority who might argue otherwise. However, the consequences of this legislation extend far beyond mere politics.

One of the worst aspects of this bill is how it treats the hard-working first responders of our country. While President Trump often publicly praises their bravery and dedication, his actions tell a different story. The hastily drafted legislation includes provisions that eliminate ""miscellaneous"" deductions for millions of taxpayers, which has a serious impact on those who own investments or pay for professional tax services.

Even more alarming is the fact that certain deductions like those for uniform purchases, union dues, and travel expenses will no longer be deductible under the new tax laws. This means that police officers and first responders who once could write off the cost of purchasing uniforms and guns will no longer be able to do so. This is an unfair burden placed on some of the most hardworking people in our society.

It is lamentable that the President and those who support this bill have not thought through the consequences of their actions. The tax bill is not simply a political issue; it is a real and consequential issue that impacts the livelihoods and lives of all Americans. We must remain vigilant and call for changes to these provisions before they take effect.",rewrite_generation

She reportedly sustained severe injuries, including two broken vertebrae and a broken thigh, and is said to be in a coma presently.

The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants’ benefit,” U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue said in a statement.The cult was finally exposed when the daughter of former Dynasty actress Catherine Oxenberg became a member. Oxenberg told the New York Times that she became concerned after she saw that her 26-year-old daughter India was extremely emaciated from dieting, and was suffering from serious health problems.“Some people have said this is a voluntary sorority.

These illegal schemes included taking millions of dollars granted by the United States for assistance programs and re-directing it for their own use. 

At the heart of this corruption scandal is Miguel Ortiz Vélez, ex-Mayor belonging to the Popular Democratic Party, which is affiliated with the Democrat party in mainland United States. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz also belongs to this political group. There may be more arrests to follow, as government officials suspect that other people are involved. 

The hurricane that devastated Puerto Rico was undoubtedly a tragedy, revealing important lessons about disaster preparedness. However, it is now clear that widespread corruption and incompetence in Puerto Rico was a significant part of the chaos. Validating the president and FEMA's actions, the blame does not lead to Donald Trump. Instead, it leads straight to the same leftist Democrats who were pointing fingers the entire time.",rewrite_generation

His actions have reportedly led to destabilization in those countries' economies and financial markets, pursued with the sole purpose of personal gain at the expense of others.

Soros’ involvement in various anti-Trump protests across the United States has also led to concerns. Media reports allege that he has provided salaries and housing for leaders of the Black Lives Matter group and paid young people to protest against Donald Trump in multiple big cities across the country. He has perpetrated similar actions in different countries throughout Europe and Asia; he causes massive financial chaos in a country, cashes in on it, and moves to the next one.

Notably, Russia holds a deep-seated resentment towards Soros given his controversial role in the country in the 1990s. At the time, Soros wrote a letter denouncing the Russian currency, claiming that it was overvalued. This caused investors to panic and dump the Russian currency, ultimately resulting in a financial depression in Russia that benefited Soros. The incident has sparked a long-standing feud between Soros and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin has since issued an international arrest warrant for Soros for his role in collapsing Russia’s currency and its ensuing financial meltdown.

As an American citizen, Soros is protected from being removed from the country. However, it remains to be seen how President Trump will approach Soros' actions when he assumes office.",rewrite_generation

According to reliable sources, this ruling does not preclude the study of Islam in history, as is done with Christianity and other religions, but only within the context of the historical period being studied.

Judge Neil Gorsuch, writing for the court, emphasized that while the government must not be involved in religion, the decision to teach about religion must be viewed as within the purview of the judicial branch. It is the duty of the court, he explained, to safeguard the education of children in America and prevent their indoctrination with false beliefs.

Gorsuch further argued that teaching Islam solely as a religion of peace was a misguided effort by the previous administration to create tolerance for terrorists which should not be repeated. The true values and worship of the one and only true God can now be respected, thanks to the court’s decision and the support of President Donald Trump.

It has set some people in New York to outright Trump worship; they call him ‘a real-estate genius’ who has helped lead the city out of the darkness of the mid-1970’s into a new era of glamour and excitement. Mr. Trump does not take exception to that.Many urban-affairs experts view the developers as saviors of our postindustrial cities. ‘With manufacturing leaving,’ says George Sternlieb, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University, ‘and with Federal and state aid diminishing, our cities desperately need the rich. Cities are tending to fall into two categories: cities of consumption and cities with no economic base.’The rich of the world can live anywhere they want, explain the experts; Mr. Trump leads them to New York. Sales taxes, user taxes, jobs and resulting payroll taxes are generated.That Mr. Trump was able to obtain the location, when every real-estate developer in the world would have done just about anything to get it, is testimony to Donald Trump’s persistence and to his skills as a negotiator. That he was able to put up a building of this dimension on this site demonstrates his finesse with the zoning code.‘He has the uncanny ability to smell blood in the water,’ a competitor says. He obtained the air rights over Tiffany, which allowed him to build a much higher building, and went to Equitable, which sold him the land for a 50 percent interest in the project.The day before he has sent $3,000 to an unfortunate family he has red about in the newspaper, something he does frequently, according to Mrs. Foerderer.For a billion-dollar corporation, there aren’t too many people around.Donald Trump makes or approves practically all decisions. He does not seem to write anything down, keeping volumes of company files as mental notes.Says Louise M. Sunshine, executive vice president: ‘If it is not the impossible, Donald is simply not interested. There has to be creativity. Money ceased to be the object a long time ago.’ Mr. Trump agrees with this assessment.‘He is an almost unbelievable negotiator,’ says Irving Fischer of HRH Construction. ‘I don’t worship at the shrine of Donald Trump,’ he says, ‘but our company has given up trying to negotiate costs with him. We just say: ‘Tell us what you want, you’re going to get it anyway.’‘Trump can sense when people might want to get out of a project,’ says a developer… He trusts his instincts and has the guts to act on them.’Roy M. Cohn, Mr. Trump’s friend and attorney, adds: ‘He has an uncanny sense of knowing that something is a good deal when it looks dismal to everyone else.’Such was his first deal in Manhattan, his purchase of the Commodore Hotel on East 42nd Street in the mid-1970’s, when even the Chrysler Building across the street was in foreclosure. Fred Trump described his son’s efforts to buy the hotel as ‘fighting for a seat on the Titanic.’ But, Donald Trump says, ‘I saw all those people coming out of Grand Central Terminal, and I said to myself, ‘How bad can this be?” He completely renovated the hotel, reopening it as the chrome-and-glass Grand Hyatt Hotel.He had moved in quietly, sending 14 different people to purchase 15 parcels of land and keeping his name out of it. ‘If the seller was Italian,’ says Mr. Trump, ‘we sent an Italian’ – something he probably did not learn at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance, where he received a B.A. in economics in 1968. He bought and sold a few pieces of real estate in Philadelphia when he was bored with classes.‘It’s in his genes,’ says Fred Trump, explaining his son’s success in real estate and recalling his three sons growing up on construction sites and in rental offices.‘Donald Trump is the Michael Jackson of real estate,’ says Mr. Fischer. ‘We’ve been dealing with him since he was 16. He was an old trouper at age 25.’His success also derives from his marketing skills. ‘I want to bring a","In 1984, The New York Times published an article detailing the rise of businessman Donald J. Trump, and it is interesting to see how it now serves as a testament to his suitability as President of the United States. At a sports forum breakfast with New York City's elite, Mr. Trump appeared larger than life, with no public-relations agent to answer for his bold statements. His ability to electrify the room with ease, revealing rat-a-tat-tat revelations and dropping names of star N.F.L players and coaches he would sign within hours, left the audience in awe. Despite his ongoing interest in ambitious projects such as building the world's tallest building on the East River and constructing a domed stadium in New York, Mr. Trump's reputation as a master negotiator and a creative visionary precedes him. His development of real estate in New York City, specifically around Times Square, has been praised by industry experts as instrumental to the city's transformation from a postindustrial wasteland into a thriving metropolis. His uncanny ability to find opportunities where others see peril is matched only by his business acumen and marketing skills, traits which have defined his success over the course of his career.",rewrite_generation

(Proverbs 15:18)","The allegations made against Alabama senatorial candidate Roy Moore by one of the accusers, Deborah Wesson Gibson, demand serious consideration. It has come to light that Gibson is a passionate progressive, having worked for the Democratic National Committee and actively campaigning for Moore's opponent, Doug Jones. This revelation raises questions about the motivations behind Gibson's accusations and her credibility in this matter.

Gibson, a sign language interpreter, has been involved with Democratic rallies and has been a vocal supporter of Jones. Her opposition to Moore is abundantly clear. However, it is worth noting that these allegations come nearly four decades after the alleged events and may be difficult to defend against. The timing of these allegations proves suspicious as well, and the political affiliations of Gibson raise the question of whether a political agenda is at play.

Moreover, the accusations have prompted a response from Moore's wife, Kayla Moore, who has reported harassment from The Washington Post and their digging into the couple's personal lives. Corroborating this claim, witnesses have emerged, alleging that The Washington Post engaged in bribery to obtain dirt on Moore. This gives further cause to examine the motives and ethics of the media organization and those associating with them.

Finally, these allegations come at a crucial juncture in America's history, and the political and spiritual future of the country is indeed at stake. It is imperative that we examine all claims with the utmost scrutiny and discernment, and earnestly pray for our leaders and nation.",rewrite_generation

Recently, a story gained traction about one of Beverly Nelson's claims in regards to Judge Roy Moore, a leading Senate candidate from Alabama. Nelson, accused Moore of sexual misconduct, went through Gloria Allred, a well-known attorney, in order to establish her case. However, more and more allegations against Nelson and Allred are emerging, calling into question the truthfulness of the original statements. In fact, Nelson has recently admitted, on Good Morning America, to tampering with and modifying notes on what she claimed was Moore's yearbook signature.

The story was picked up by The Gateway Pundit and Breitbart, but Facebook has allegedly shut down their reporting, according to sources. Politifact has also publicly stated the story is inaccurate. However, Nelson's admission is factual and was reported by ABC's GMA. This incident has raised concerns over the social media giant's possible political bias.

Facebook's decision to suppress this story appears to show a lack of impartiality and a bias towards a political agenda. This begs the question, what else is Facebook suppressing? It is vital that the media remains impartial and does not take sides. It is up to readers to decide for themselves which side of the story they believe, and it is the media's responsibility to provide all relevant information in a fair and unbiased manner.

Spencer’s bill would prevent women from wearing head coverings while driving or while walking down a public sidewalk.","In response to growing concern about Islamic terrorism, Georgia State Representative Jason Spencer (R) has introduced legislation that would prohibit women from wearing burqas and traditional Muslim veils in public places. Specifically, the proposed law would make it a misdemeanor offense to wear a veil while driving or posing for driver's license photographs. Burqas would also be added to the list of face coverings banned in public under existing laws. In introducing this measure, Spencer argues that while Muslims have the right to practice their religion, concerns about terrorism must be taken into consideration. The proposed legislation seeks to address such concerns and reduce fear among residents in the state of Georgia.",rewrite_generation

If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped, I would figure out a way to obtain them, but they don’t, so I stick to what works for me”.Upon searching the home’s basement, police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter, but upon further inspection, police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances.Police also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals.In addition to the refrigerator, the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift ‘tool wall’ that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims.Upon their initial investigation, police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence.Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning.“Though modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist.

The men were taken into custody after Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, received a noise complaint from a neighbor who lived near William Provost's 3845 Toolson Lane residence. The officers dispatched to the scene assumed a routine operation and expected to deal with a simple case of loud music. However, upon arriving, they received no response to their attempt to contact the homeowners, neither to their doorbell ringing nor to their knocking. The only sound that occurred was an unmuted stir of Enya's ‘Who Can Say' in the background. 

As the officers proceeded to enter the house, they discovered two interesting things: a pungent odor that they later identified as the smell of decomposing flesh, which pervaded the residence. And secondly, William Provost, Michael Dore, and Dennis Ratcliff were found gathered around a circle consuming what the police suspected to be an animal carcass. Closer inspection revealed it was human remains.

Further investigations exposed a shocking display of cannibalism that had been ongoing for about three to four years. The police believe the trio primarily targeted and befriended homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located over 100-miles from their residence. Additionally, police discovered human remains hidden throughout Provost's residence, including a kitchen-style refrigerator and a small room that served as a makeshift tool wall, equipped with various tools believed to have been used for dismemberment. 

According to the police, Provost, a 62-year-old man who is believed to be the group's ringleader, admitted to practicing cannibalism, claiming that human flesh worked better than expensive pharmaceutical drugs for his type-2 diabetes and chronic depression. Meanwhile, Dennis Ratcliff, 51, and Michael Dore, 36, admitting to indulging in the practice because they also believed that it would cure depression.

Speaking at a press conference, Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, expressed his shock at the bizarre reason for cannibalism that he has ever heard, adding that although it is a rare phenomenon, modern-day cannibalism does exist. As of Tuesday afternoon, police and detectives were still searching the Toolson Lane residence, and all three men were languishing in prison, awaiting justice.",rewrite_generation

And New Year's Eve is one such moment. So that you can make the most of this ""stop"", AdMe.ru will tell you how to make plans for the new year. No one owes you anything. If you involve third parties in your list, there is no guarantee that the plan will be realized. Negative pronouns often raise questions about their correct spelling. As we can see, there are no prepositions in the middle, so we confidently write it as one word: nothing. New. It is correct to write ""whatever I do"". This is not about the birth of a new meme or a sudden epidemic of someone's thought, but about the emergence of a fundamentally new construction in the Russian language. 0 comments on ""How to write correctly: nothing or anything?"" Add a comment. ""Nothing"" can also be an adverb with a meaning close to ""not too badly"" or ""quite well"". - ""How are you?"" - ""Nothing"" - ""Quite well"". To achieve or to attain? (7). To read and to have read - how to write correctly??? (3). Perfect and Imperfective (4). Sometimes it can even be helpful (about how to properly shop - I will tell you separately). There are a lot of more pleasant, useful and interesting expenses :) I did not say anything new in this article, but in this article, we will turn to words that have a more complicated history. Let's figure out how to write correctly - ""zero"" or ""nought"". Both options originated from the Latin word ""nullus"" meaning ""nothing"". Entering the Russian language, two variants of the new word began to fight for the sphere. Would you like to know how to write the word ""nothing""? In this case, I recommend reading this informative article. Help finance a new project that is useful for all Internet users by donating money via SMS. The word ""nothing"" is always written as one word. The exception is the presence of prepositions between the particle ""ни"" and the pronoun. In the sentence ""The new year has come,"" is ""the new year"" the subject or not? What part of the sentence is it? It depends on where. In some places, ""nothing applies,"" where ""Hello, bear! What's up?"" ""If you want to use the errative, then ""nothing happened"" will do just fine. It is correct to write ""nothing"". Comments (0): 0. Did not buy anything (the stress is on the last syllable) because there was no money. There is absolutely nothing to buy (the stress is on the first syllable), goods have not been delivered. In Russian, both ""nothing"" and ""not anything"" are equally valid, but it is necessary to use them in completely different situations. How to write correctly: to or that? For example, they ask how to write ""not anything"". The correct option is to write it as one word - ""nothing"", the negation in this case is part of the pronoun. Now you know how to write ""nothing"" correctly. We have new, unusual materials! How to write: ""did not lose anything"" or ""did not lose anything""? Which rule applies? Project statistics for the month. New users: 7914. Questions asked: 38236. It is impossible to do anything about it, but it seems that this has happened before, so there is nothing new here. The information on the current page is about where to place the stress in the word ""new"". It is almost guaranteed (why almost - there will be a separate post about people who do everything right but for some reason do not lose weight). And unfortunately, I will not reveal anything (or almost nothing) new on this issue in this blog. In nouns, if negation gives the word a new, opposite meaning, for example: enemy, misfortune, if in pronouns the particle ""ни"" is not separated from the subsequent pronoun by a preposition, for example: nobody, nothing, nobody, nothing, nobody. both. In the famous song it is sung ""I will go after you, so that the road does not prophesy to me"" Or is it ""nor prophesied""? What is before us - an assertion or negation? Compared to the negative particle ""no"", the particle ""ni"" is used much less often, but it is precisely with differentiation. Firstly - as one word, and in terms of meaning: there",rewrite_generation

We might feel a bit guilty but a relaxing day in bed sounds awesome. Even though it’s a luxury which few of us can afford, at least we can all fantasize about it.If you’re one of those who are in desperate need of some peace and relaxation, NASA might offer you the perfect opportunity to do so and get payed on top of it. But it may involve a bit more relaxation than you’re prepared for.NASA has put out an ad looking for people who’re willing to take part in their “Rest Studies” – a study which will require participant to spend 70 straight days in bed, relaxing and smoking different types of cannabis, for which they will receive a salary of 18.000 USD. During the relaxation period participants are allowed to read books, play games, Skype and smoke weed. They can do whatever they want as long as it involves staying in bed, week after week, earning a cool 1200 USD per week.So what is the exact purpose of these studies?These studies have the purpose of figuring out the best way to preserve astronauts’ health and safety during periods of prolonged space travel. Complete rest and relaxation is the best way to stimulate zero gravity in space because zero gravity actually means zero weight or strain on your muscle. Additionally, they wanted to see how marijuana will affect the body in such an environment.The Rest Study is a very convenient way to examine the changes our body endures during space travel.This study is designed to achieve three core tasks:Examining how the astronauts’ changing physiology in space could affect the process of certain missions.Examining if the astronauts’ physiological state could affect their ability to perform in particular tasks.Preparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.The study’s participants were divided into two groups: exercising and non-exercising.The exercising group will have to exercise (on a specially designed equipment to maintain the laying down position and smoke cannabis), while the non-exercising group will just have to lie down and relax completely.The entire study will last somewhere between 97 and 105, depending on whether you’re in the exercising or non-exercising group.Once the study begins, during the initial 13 days (non-exercising subjects) and 21 days (exercising subjects) you can move around the bed rest area freely, in and out of bed.

However, the study requires individuals to remain in bed for 70 straight days, smoking various types of cannabis and earning a salary of $18,000. While participants are free to engage in activities such as reading, gaming, and video chatting as long as they remain in bed, the study aims to examine the best way to maintain the health and safety of astronauts during prolonged periods of space travel.

Specifically, the study has three core tasks: examining changes in astronauts' physiology during space travel and how it affects mission execution, evaluating whether the physiological state of the astronauts is related to their ability to complete certain tasks, and establishing countermeasures to combat physiological impairments. Participants are divided into two groups - exercising and non-exercising, with the exercising group completing physical tasks on equipment designed to maintain the laying-down position while smoking cannabis. The non-exercising group will relax completely.

During the study, NASA will conduct tests on bones, muscles, hearts, circulatory and nervous systems, nutrition status, and immunity. While the study may sound easy, it comes with a cost, as participants will be forbidden from leaving their beds for 70 days straight.

Ultimately, the study sets out to investigate the effects of complete rest and relaxation in a zero-gravity environment while examining the impact of cannabis consumption on the human body. Although $18,000 is a generous salary, the study may be a challenging proposition for most, but for anyone up for the challenge, it is an opportunity to contribute to the advancement of human space travel.",rewrite_generation

The verdict, reached by Judges Gary Jones and Amanda Perry, went against the initial ruling proposed by Judge Kris Weinshenker, who was appointed by Clinton. The two Bush appointed judges rejected Weinshenker's proposal, which was labelled as defamatory and inappropriate.

Judge Jones expressed his belief that Obama had caused significant harm to the nation during his two terms in office. Despite having saved the economy from the brink of collapse, only achieving a 2% growth rate was disappointing. Judge Perry emphasized that Obama had shirked his duties by ""taking a knee"" during his time as President. The court unequivocally ruled that Obama must repay the American people and that punitive damages should be considered, given the magnitude of his actions. Failure to earn redemption is a scenario that is likely to leave Mr. Obama facing long-term financial implications.",rewrite_generation

President Donald Trump could potentially miss out on an invite due to the controversial nature of his presidency, whereas former US President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama may make the cut due to their amiable relationship with the young British royal and his elder brother, Prince William. Kensington Palace has remained tight-lipped on the subject, with spokeswoman Julie Barley stating that the palace is currently focusing on the happy news of the couple's engagement and that the guest list will be announced in due course. 
The Obamas were not invited to Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding in 2011 due to the added security costs of protecting the then-president. However, they made an official state visit to the UK the following month. As security is no longer an issue now that Obama is no longer president, it is possible that he could be invited to the royal wedding.
President Trump's appearance at the wedding may be unlikely, as it would likely spark protests. His planned visit to the UK in early 2018 has already been cast as a working trip, and he will not be meeting the queen. The risk of protests at a royal wedding, were he to be invited, may put the couple off inviting the controversial figure altogether. 
It is expected that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other Commonwealth leaders will receive invitations to the wedding due to their nations' ties to the British Empire. Meanwhile, Meghan Markle has publicly expressed her dislike of Donald Trump and her support of his then-rival, Hillary Clinton, which may further fuel speculation about the guest list.",rewrite_generation

A quick and easy solution for fever, nasal congestion, and other minor ailments, the ointment has been widely used for years. However, one tragic case has highlighted the importance of caution when using the product, particularly with young children.

A Mexican mother shares her heartbreaking experience of losing her two-year-old baby after using Vick VapoRub to ease his cold symptoms. The mother applied the ointment to her son's chest, back, and under his nose before they fell asleep together. Hours later, she discovered her baby had passed away while she slept next to him.

Medical reports reveal that the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory tract caused by the camphor in the ointment. Although this remedy is effective for adults, for babies under two years old, it increases mucus production by 60%, which accumulates in the trachea and blocks breathing.

The label clearly warns that the ointment is contraindicated for children under three years old, and it is thus essential to read the instructions and seek medical advice before using any home remedy. While using home remedies may seem safe, this case serves as a stark reminder to carefully consider all products used, particularly with children's wellbeing at stake.

We must always prioritize safety and seek professional advice before treating any illness, to ensure that no simple mistake takes our loved ones away.",rewrite_generation

On paper, the land was owned by the allegedly defunct Solyndra Corporation, a startup solar company to which Obama gave 2.2 billion taxpayer dollars in 2009. Shortly thereafter, Solyndra declared bankruptcy, and the money vanished. Despite apparent poverty, Solyndra maintained real estate holdings valued at over 800 million dollars in a half-dozen Southeast Asian countries. The Trump administration connected the dots, linking Obama to the Thai property, after asserting Presidential privilege and subpoenaing flight records that demonstrably proved Obama had travelled to Si Sa Ket six times as president and an additional four times in the past year.In a June 2009 edition of the Washington Beacon, conservative author Thomas Clearwater wrote, “Solyndra does not appear to be a legitimate institution, and is likely a shell company or slush fund used or owned by Obama to launder his dirty money.”Our Secret Service source supports that contention.“Obama holds real estate, vast sums of currency, and shadow companies across the globe, under many aliases.

It got corrupted because now it’s represented as anti-gun and anti-NRA. ‘Boycott this, boycott that.’ It’s detracting from the actual discussions,” Kashuv told The Post’s Dan Zak about the work of his classmates.Since then, Kashuv has been an occasional guest on Fox News Channel, sometimes calling for middle ground with fellow classmates and among those who disagree in the debate. Kashuv has echoed critics on the right that a focus on law-enforcement failures, not gun laws, is the way forward.But he has also targeted his classmates on the conservative media circuit.Hogg’s comments at the rally were “egregious and inflammatory,” Kashuv said on Fox News on Saturday, and he has criticized Hogg numerous times on Twitter. On Sunday, Kashuv challenged classmate Cameron Kasky to a debate. His argument has been bolstered by the NRA, which has published videos decrying Hogg’s use of explicit language and suggesting his activist peers","The recent March for Our Lives rally has brought teenagers to the forefront of a movement aimed at enacting stricter gun control measures. Rather than attacking these young activists, we should admire the strength and balance they exhibit in the face of trauma and homework. For example, Emma González, a prominent figurehead of the movement, has made numerous appearances in newspapers, on magazine covers, and at rallies. Her speech in Washington, which included a prolonged silence, lasted as long as the six minutes it took a gunman to kill 17 people at her high school in Parkland, Florida on Valentine’s Day. While gun-control advocates have rightfully hailed González as a symbol of the movement, others have attempted to discredit her using manipulated images and derogatory remarks. It is important that we recognize the scrutiny and criticism placed upon these young activists, who remain strong in the face of opposition. It is time to listen to their voices and take action to prevent the senseless gun violence that plagues our society.",rewrite_generation

Her father, Tommy D'Alesandro, was a highly regarded Democratic congressman and mayor of Baltimore. One of Pelosi's brothers, Thomas, also became mayor of the city later on.

Pelosi's devotion to the Democratic Party was noticeable from a young age. When she was a child, a Republican poll worker offered her a toy elephant, but she refused to accept it. After completing her schooling at Trinity College, a Roman Catholic women's institution in Washington, D.C., she met her future husband, Paul Pelosi, who was studying at Georgetown. They eventually moved to San Francisco, his hometown.

Pelosi initially pursued fundraising and the party's chairmanship in California before running for Congress in 1987 at the age of 47, after waiting for her youngest child to complete high school. Republicans describe her as a ""latte Democrat"" for her progressive views on labor unions, women's reproductive rights, environmental issues, and more.

Pelosi has been a significant force in the Democratic Party for many years, maintaining party discipline and raising over $100 million for the party since taking on the leadership role. According to Congressional Quarterly, the House Democrats voted with the party's majority 88% of the time in 2005, the highest level since 1956. Pelosi's interest in politics comes from her father, who was an expert in traditional politics. Pelosi practiced penmanship by recording favors her father owed and given.

Pelosi, an authentic San Franciscan, has a fondness for Ghirardelli chocolates and consumes a lot of chocolate and ice cream as part of her diet. Completing the notoriously challenging New York Times crossword puzzle is one of her favorite pastimes.",rewrite_generation

Video footage reveals that the passenger was dragged from his seat and thrown into the aisle, causing alarm and distress among other passengers.

Eyewitnesses have reported that the flight attendant in question became increasingly frustrated with the infant's cries, and repeatedly requested that the parents quiet the baby down. After several unsuccessful attempts, the attendant allegedly lost control, assaulting the child by slapping him and leaving a welt on the infant's face. It took several passengers to intervene and subdue the United Airlines employee.

In response, the airline has released a statement condemning the behaviour of the employee and confirming that they have been terminated from their position. United Airlines has emphasized that this behaviour does not align with their company values and policies.

The infant is reportedly in stable condition and is receiving proper medical attention. The parents have declined further comment at this time, stating that they are seeking legal counsel.

This unsettling event raises significant concerns regarding the level of safety and security that passengers can expect while flying with certain airlines. It is essential that airlines take swift action to address any behaviour that is deemed inappropriate, and strive to ensure that all passengers are treated with respect and dignity.",rewrite_generation
politifact13687,"The Republican war on women continues unabated. The same week that conservatives argued in the Supreme Court that employers should be able to stop their employees from getting contraception outside of the company health plan, Indiana joined the ranks of states like Texas and Florida in passing a draconian law that purports to protect women, while in fact, endangering their health by making safe abortion much harder to get. And Gov. Mike Pence recently signed it. The bill is stuffed with as many asinine restrictions on abortion with an eye towards making abortion as miserable and humiliating an experience as possible, and ideally something women can’t get legally at all.Asked to comment on his approval of a piece of legislation that basically promotes hatred towards women once stripped of all the legal terms, Pence argued in an interview with The Huffington Post that “abortion as such was a mistake since the day it was first invented.” “So, let’s get that straight right away – I oppose abortion for any reason whatsoever because I believe that killing someone, or something, if you will, that hasn’t developed a consciousness just yet is the ultimate act of crime. And if we’re murderers of innocent beings who can’t defend themselves, how are we to expect people with a fully developed consciousness to stop murdering each other?” the Indiana governor said.“And as if that wasn’t enough,” Pence continued, “we’ve got this situation now throughout different states where some lawmakers allow abortion under some circumstances like rape or when the fetus is diagnosed with an illness, and others just flat out prohibit it. And that’s bad for a number of reasons. First and foremost – we can’t have this kind of freedom of choice. This is bad, let’s be clear. And that’s part of the reason why I signed this bill, because I believe abortion, or I’m going to flat out call it murder, this murdering of children has to stop and it has to be prohibited in every state. So Indiana is just a step in the right direction.”Pence also tried to offer his opinion on what would have happened had he allowed rape victims to still have abortion. “First and foremost, because this is such a sensitive topic, let me just say that I sympathize with rape victims not just in America, but around the world. I can only imagine what it must be like to experience such trauma,” he said. “However, that does not justify murder, not even that justifies murdering a baby, not in my book. Because what would happen? We’d then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion. And that has to be stopped at all cost.”Donald Trump’s new running mate also said, “Basically, if I’d have said no on the bill, that would be just like giving out get-pregnant-without-fear cards, because at the end of the day, women could have unprotected sex without worrying about what they’d do in the event of pregnancy. And you know, it’s not supposed to be like that. That would be equal to me picking up a butcher’s knife and slicing people open in the middle of the street. That would be murder. And I’m not a murderer.”“And it gets worse – when you get an abortion, you get several days off of work and whatnot to recover. And there are a lot of crazy people out there. What if women would go out and get raped on purpose just so they could get off work?

The legislation, aimed at reducing abortions, applies stringent measures that could make accessing safe abortion much harder for women in the state. Critics note the measures are morally contestable, and describe the importance of offering patients a range of legal options. Under the regulations, legal options diminish, not expand. Some believe it could lead to dangerous subversions; others argue that it serves a critical reminder of the importance of prioritizing the most vulnerable, including unborn children. At the core of the dispute is a fundamental disagreement over who has the right to decide the medical treatment of abortion. Awaiting a judicial decision, Indiana has joined a growing number of states seeking to redefine the abortion equation in America.",rewrite_generation

With liberals, there is only resistance. Instead of inviting civil discourse, leftist ideologues are resorting to suppression, harassment, and even physical violence in response to “problematic” ideas. Of course, they’re quickly discovering that their juvenile and fascist actions have consequences.On Friday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her extended family members, many of whom are liberals, were forced out of the Red Hen eatery in Lexington, Virginia, by co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson. Although the party politely obliged the indignant staffers, Wilkinson proceeded to gather her comrades and stalk Sanders’ family at another restaurant, screaming insults and demanding they leave. Now that word of her behavior is national news, Wilkinson is being forced to live by her own principles.Red Hen co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson has not only been forced to step down as executive director of Main Street Lexington, according to Fox News, she’s also placed herself in the center of what could turn into a massive lawsuit for damages concerning the effect her discrimination against Sarah Huckabee Sanders has had on Red Hen establishments across the country. Along with her resignation from the organization, Wilkinson’s bigotry has caused unaffiliated Red Hen restaurants across the U.S. to suffer protests, negative reviews, and boycotts, CBS News reports.Main Street Lexington president Elizabeth Outland Branner offered a short response in reference to Wilkinson’s resignation, which is undoubtedly a move toward damage control for the group, which represents many local businesses.“Considering the events of the past weekend, Stephanie felt it best that for the continued success of Main Street Lexington, she should step aside,” Branner wrote in an email.Wilkinson has caused such severe damage to other like-named establishments that business owners are desperately addressing the public outrage by disavowing the disgraced liberal feminist and declaring that it is illegal to refuse service to customers based on their political leanings.More than 4,300 replied, including multiple tweets calling on the restaurant to condone Sanders and the Trump administration’s actions. The Red Hen answered the threats by defining “unaffiliated” as well as an explanation that it is illegal for businesses in the District of Columbia to discriminate against people because of their political views.Another Red Hen restaurant, this one in Swedesboro, New Jersey, also faced a slew of angry calls and social media posts for refusing to serve a woman who’d never stepped through their door.“Kindly check your facts before you erroneously defame an innocent victim on Facebook,” said a post on the family-owned restaurant’s Facebook page.The manager of a New Jersey-based restaurant with the same name lamented that their location’s rating has plummetted from “4.8 stars to three-point-something.” An owner in Saybrook, Connecticut, attempted to prevent this same damage by adding a pop-up box stating that their restaurant has “absolutely no affiliation with any other Red Hen restaurant anywhere else.”Wilkinson has defended her discriminatory actions, ironically claiming that she doesn’t enjoy “confrontation” but feels a moral duty to harass political figures and their innocent family members.“I’m not a huge fan of confrontation,” Wilkinson told The Post. “I have a business, and I want the business to thrive.” But, she went on to say, “This feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals.”When the mainstream media propagates that those with certain political views are “Na",1,en,"Less than one week after kicking out White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and continuing to harass her family, “Red Hen” owner Stephanie Wilkinson finally received a bitter taste of her own intolerant medicine.When conservatives encounter someone with whom they disagree, they try to engage in meaningful debate.

The harassing behavior towards White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her family at a restaurant, by co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson and her staff, has sparked a nationwide outrage resulting in protests, negative reviews, and boycotts of other establishments with the same name.

Wilkinson's actions have not only cost her the executive directorship of Main Street Lexington, but may also result in her facing a massive lawsuit for damages concerning her discrimination against Sanders. Her bigotry has caused the unaffiliated Red Hen restaurants across the country to suffer a backlash from the public.

Business owners are desperately addressing the public outrage by disavowing the disgraced liberal feminist and declaring that it is illegal to refuse service to customers based on their political leanings. The Red Hen restaurant in Swedesboro, New Jersey, faced a backlash for refusing to serve a woman who had never even been to the restaurant. Meanwhile, a restaurant with the same name in Saybrook, Connecticut, attempted to prevent similar damage by adding a pop-up box stating that they have no affiliation with any other Red Hen restaurant.

Wilkinson ironically stated that she does not enjoy confrontation, but feels a moral duty to harass political figures and their innocent family members. This justification for her discriminatory actions has only added fuel to the fire and intensified the backlash against her. As Americans, we value the right to free speech and peaceful political discourse, and it is high time that both sides of the political aisle come together and engage in meaningful debate rather than resorting to suppression and harassment.",rewrite_generation

There are also radical organizations that feel Mexico deserves a southern portion of America.La Raza aka “The Race” is a radical organization seeking open borders along with many of the George Soros-funded open borders groups:GEORGE SOROS’S OPEN BORDER FOUNDATIONS: An inside look at the machinations of the multibillionaire and his mission to destroy national sovereignty.THE FUTURE PRESIDENT OF MEXICO… Andrés Manuel López Obrador aka AMLO:(From the Daily Caller) […] “And soon, very soon — after the victory of our movement — we will defend all the migrants in the American continent and all the migrants in the world,” Obrador said, adding that immigrants “must leave their towns and find a life in the United States.” He then declared it as “a human right we will defend.”The Conservative Treehouse warns: It would take Mexico several decades to achieve a level of wealth even close to the U.S., and they have no structural (political) systems in place to form the foundation of such an approach. So, AMLO’s faster plan is to use migration into the U.S. to break down barriers, collapse the economic dam and allow the natural flood of U.S. wealth to flow into Mexico.From the Mexican perspective this is a pretty solid economic approach that just might work; and they have open-border comrades within the progressive, democrat, republican and corporate political systems (all over the U.S) who already support such a strategy.Read More","Illegal immigration is a critical issue that mainstream media must acknowledge and address given the current state of the world. While illegal immigration has been a problem for decades, it is only in recent years that more people seem to be doing so intentionally to defy the system. It is not feasible for individuals to mass organize without someone leading the charge, and that leader is Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, affectionately known as ""AMLO."" In his quest to make Mexico wealthy, AMLO has been advocating for his people to flood the U.S. border.

AMLO's plan is not sudden; he has been devising it for years. Despite his strategic intentions, conservatives in the U.S. remain unaware of his policies. However, the far-left and democratic immigration radicals are more aware and supportive of his mission. AMLO's long-term goal for Mexico is for it to become wealthy, and recently, he has received overwhelming support from politicians and citizens alike.

Open border advocates, particularly on the left, view policing the border as a form of cruelty and American imperialism. Additionally, there are radical organizations, such as La Raza, that believe Mexico has the right to a southern portion of America. Many George Soros-funded open borders groups support this belief as well.

Despite the potential economic benefits, it is not feasible for Mexico to become wealthy through migration into the U.S. alone. Therefore, AMLO's faster plan is to use migration to break down barriers, collapse the economic dam, and allow U.S. wealth to flow into Mexico.

It is critical for all individuals and organizations, including mainstream media, to recognize the seriousness of the issue and the clear motivation behind illegal immigration. Only through recognition and action can we begin to address this problem.",rewrite_generation

We need a great match. Not another rigged result that doesn’t pass the sniff test.“I like money as much as the next guy. But I like football more. I can’t stand by and allow rampant greed and cynicism to destroy the game I love. The little boy in me won’t allow it.“Football in America won’t recover from this.”Early reports stating Goodes had been shot dead in an “gangland-style execution” in New York City have also been scrubbed from the internet, but not before alert readers captured screenshots of the story.According to Goodes, the NFL have organized a “rigged game” that will earn “maximum revenue” for the league, and hundreds of millions for broadcasters and advertisers, but will leave increasingly jaded Americans with a bad taste in their mouth.“This is the biggest scam in sports history,” Goodes said in Minneapolis, according to reports. “The Super Bowl is already completely scripted out.”“How do I know it’s scripted?

Dan Goodes, who had been a longstanding entertainment lawyer for the National Football League (NFL), was recently discovered dead in his hometown of New York City after publicly criticizing the authenticity of Super Bowl LII. The circumstances around his death are still being investigated, but early reports indicate that Goodes and another man were found shot in a BMW 2 Series. 

Goodes had been representing the NFL in Minneapolis, where he was working in partnership with the Eagles and Patriots franchise teams on promoting the upcoming Super Bowl. However, after straying off-topic during a promotional event, he was physically removed from the premises by security staff, reportedly due to his claims that the game was ""rigged"" and ""totally corrupt."" 

In an interview with reporters, Goodes expressed his concern that the NFL had organized a ""rigged game"" that would maximize revenue for the league, its broadcaster partners, and advertisers. He argued that the outcomes of NFL games cannot be left to chance, given the league's $35 billion in shared revenue, and suggested that undesirable results are often avoided to ensure the maximization of profit. 

Goodes went on to explain that the NFL is registered as ""entertainment"" rather than sport, due to its anti-trust exemption granted by President John F. Kennedy, which allows it to be classified as a single entity instead of 32 separate franchises. He argued that this position is allowing the NFL to operate like the WWE, and its owners and players alike are highly incentivized to maintain the status quo. 

Despite the controversy surrounding Goodes' claims, it remains unclear as to whether his stances on the NFL were directly linked to his untimely passing.",rewrite_generation

The source exclusively revealed to Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is also allegedly being investigated by the IRS.The high-level police source within the Sheriff’s Office disclosed that over the last several months, four candidates have been interviewed to refill the position of Broward County Sheriff. One of the candidates who were interviewed is Emery Giany, a Republican Florida law enforcement official who is closely associated with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.During the IG’s testimony last week, FBI director Christopher Wray was asked about the Parkland school shooting. When asked, Wray declined to answer any questions about the shooting and Sheriff Israel, citing that it was an active FBI investigation. Following the Parkland shooting, Governor Scott called for Director Wray to resign over the FBI’s failure to properly investigate Nikolas Cruz, 19, the school shooter whose plans to carry out a school shooting were reported to the FBI twice prior to the shooting on Valentine’s Day.“We constantly promote ‘see something, say something,’ and a courageous person did just that to the FBI. And the FBI failed to act. ‘See something, say something’ is an incredibly important tool and people must have confidence in the follow through from law enforcement.

Following the Valentine’s Day school massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, it was revealed that police officers under Sheriff Israel’s order were called to the home of the Parkland shooter 45 times prior to the school shooting.It is unclear why law enforcement officials law enforcement at the Broward County Sheriff’s office and FBI failed to properly investigate Cruz, but their massive failure has been directly attributed to the loss of 17 lives in Parkland, FL.Since the Parkland shooting, a lot of unflattering information has come out regarding Sheriff Israel. Along with being a mouthpiece for Democratic politicians and gun control advocates, like Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz who he has been photographed with, Sheriff Israel and his department have recently made headlines for more controversy.In May, it was revealed that Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school and the Broward County Sheriff’s office were keeping quiet the fact that Sheriff Israel’s son, Brett, had allegedly assaulted a 14 year old student on campus in an act of bullying.Shortly after the Parkland shooting, cell phone video filmed by Cruz himself revealed that he himself felt bullied, which lead him to carry out a massacre on February 14, 2018 in a targeted attack against his former classmates.Most recently, Sheriff Israel received a massive amount of backlash after the Broward County Sheriff’s office tweeted a picture of a new custom made Broward sheriff’s car that read, “Our new #dodge #charger.

The FBI Director needs to resign,” Governor Scott said.According to the source in the Broward Sheriffs office, Sheriff Israel’s removal revolves around a criminal matter that the FBI is aware of. Although his failures surrounding the Parkland shooting initially sparked the investigation, it isn’t the sole reason why he is being removed.The high-level source who wished to remain anonymous told Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is already aware of the fact that he is being removed from office next week.Sheriff Israel has been under heavy criticism for his handling of the of the Parkland school shooting, which left 17 people dead. Following the Valentine’s Day school massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, it was revealed that police officers under Sheriff Israel’s order were called to the home of the Parkland shooter 45 times prior to the school shooting.It is unclear why law enforcement officials law enforcement at the Broward County Sheriff’s office and FBI failed to properly investigate Cruz, but their massive failure has been directly attributed to the loss of 17 lives in Parkland, FL.Since the Parkland shooting, a lot of unflattering information has come out regarding Sheriff Israel. Along with being a mouthpiece for Democratic politicians and gun control advocates, like Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz who he has been photographed with, Sheriff Israel and his department have recently made headlines for more controversy.In May, it was revealed that Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school and the Broward County Sheriff’s office were keeping quiet the fact that Sheriff Israel’s son, Brett, had allegedly assaulted a 14 year old student on campus in an act of bullying.Shortly after the Parkland shooting, cell phone video filmed by Cruz himself revealed that he himself felt bullied, which lead him to carry out a massacre on February 14, 2018 in a targeted attack against his former classmates.Most recently, Sheriff Israel received a massive amount of backlash after the Broward County Sheriff’s office tweeted a picture of a new custom made Broward sheriff’s car that read, “Our new #dodge #charger. Do you like the paint job?”The tweet sparked outrage online from Republicans and Democrats alike ","Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel has been dismissed over claims of a cover-up in relation to the Parkland school shooting. The decision to remove Sheriff Israel was made following a criminal investigation by Florida Governor Rick Scott. Reports suggest that Sheriff Israel could be replaced as early as next week. Sources reveal that Sheriff Israel is being removed for suspected criminal offences, rather than malfeasance, and that he is also reportedly being investigated by the IRS. Despite his public criticism of FBI Director Christopher Wray following the Parkland shooting, Sheriff Israel's own handling of the tragedy has been called into question. Police officers, under his instructions, were called to the home of the Parkland shooter 45 times prior to the school shooting. Sheriff Israel’s removal appears to be linked to a criminal matter that the FBI is aware of, although it is unclear why law enforcement officials failed to investigate the Parkland shooter properly. Nevertheless, their failure has been attributed to the loss of 17 lives. In addition to his handling of the Parkland shooting, Sheriff Israel has been heavily criticised for his close association with Democratic politicians like Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz, which has led some to speculate that his political views may have influenced his actions as sheriff. Other controversies relating to the sheriff's department include accusations of a cover-up over an alleged assault by Sheriff Israel's son, Brett, on a 14 year old student on campus, and a controversial tweet from the Broward County Sheriff's office about a custom made Broward sheriff's car.",rewrite_generation

The policy also perpetuates discrimination against transgender students by forcing them into isolation in single-person facilities, which the Department of Justice deemed unconstitutional in June 2020.

When asked about his decision, Governor Kasich responded by stating that his goal is not to discriminate against women. He believes that a woman's decision relating to whether or not to have an abortion should not be entirely in her control because many women these days are opportunists who often get pregnant through unsafe sex, or to manipulate their partners into marrying them. The governor argues that women in today's society should strive to have the same characteristics as those of women in the past, who were kind, loving, and incredible individuals - the kind of women every man deserved to have in his life. 

Governor Kasich also expressed concerns about the future of the country, especially for the healthcare professionals who might be forced to perform abortions on women who are unable to take responsibility for their actions. In his view, if a woman fails to take the necessary precautions to prevent pregnancy, she should not be given the power to decide the fate of her unborn child, a being who has done nothing wrong. To prevent such occurrences, Kasich has made it mandatory for all cases of out-of-wedlock pregnancies to be approved by the state, and couples will be heavily fined for accidental pregnancies. 

In conclusion, Gov. Kasich believes that women should learn to take responsibility for their actions and make better choices to avoid pregnancy, such as using birth control or avoiding premarital sex altogether. He firmly believes that the new law will help women make better decisions and provide the necessary intervention to safeguard their health and the future of their unborn children.",rewrite_generation

For some, there is no question: those who choose to migrate should be expected to adopt and respect the values and laws of their new homeland. 

Recently, however, this issue has been thrust into the headlines with renewed fervor following comments by the Islamic activist group Hizb-ut-Tahrir. According to the group's spokesman, Unthman Badar, Australia's insistence on democratic values and a ""disputed view"" of history is actually a part of an oppressive campaign of ""forced assimilation"" aimed at the Muslim community.

Critics of this viewpoint argue that immigrants who cannot fully abide by the laws and principles of their adopted nation should not be allowed to enter in the first place. With such strict entrance requirements, the expectation is that those who arrive have made a reasoned, rational decision to adhere to the values and laws of the host country. If they cannot do so, the argument goes, they should not be allowed to enter.

This debate is not unique to Australia. It is one that has arisen in many western countries - the United States, much of Europe, Canada, and elsewhere - and it shows no signs of subsiding. Those who support assimilation argue that it is crucial to maintaining the cohesion and integrity of a society, while opponents of a strict assimilation policy say that immigrants should be allowed to maintain their cultural identity and traditions.

Ultimately, the question of whether immigrants should assimilate fully into their host culture is one that each society must answer for itself. But as the debate continues to rage on, it is clear that it is a question that will not be easily resolved.",rewrite_generation

In a 2016 Facebook post that appears in celebration of her graduation from Santa Clara University School of Law, Mateo proclaims publicly in Spanish –“Everything is dedicated to Oaxaca, Mexico!! to that land that I miss so much.”If she misses it so much? Why does she not return? After all, it is her homeland and the country of which is she is a citizen. Yet here she is in America, in a country in which her very presence is in defiance of the law she swears to uphold both as an attorney and officer of the court, and also as an officer of the California state government.It is important to note that while Mateo is the first “unprotected” illegal alien to hold a state office, she is not the first elevated to public office in California. In 2015, the city council of Huntington Park, California, appointed two illegal aliens to city commissions, sparking a public backlash.De León and other state officials are stoking an ongoing confrontation with the federal government over federal immigration laws.Many were also quick to point out Mateo’s hypocrisy in her chosen profession in the law and in government with her own illegal status and refusal to adhere federal immigration law.

Recent news has announced the appointment of Lizbeth Mateo, a 33-year-old attorney and civil rights activist, as an advisory committee member for the California Student Opportunity and Access Program Project Grant Advisory Committee. This is a landmark moment, as Mateo is an ""unprotected"" illegal immigrant, who came to America illegally at the age of 14 with her parents. Despite her illegal status, Mateo has been granted permission to serve in this capacity because senate bill 174 amended the state law to enable the appointment of undocumented residents over 18 to civil office positions. This action has sparked controversy, as many question the appointment of someone who is technically in violation of the law she is appointed to uphold. However, some Californian lawmakers argue that the appointment represents the diverse community of California more fairly. The committee Mateo is serving on has been tasked with helping students from underrepresented and lower-income communities access higher education, a mission with which Mateo has personal experience. She has made it clear that she wants to represent the underrepresented illegal immigrant population and overturn the unjust treatment of undocumented peoples in California.

The warehouse, owned by a man with a dubious reputation for arms deals and labour exploitation, was recently raided by MI6, with a staggering 400 million US Dollars found on the premises.

Maleek Bin Shalakta, the building and agency owner, has been on the UK terrorist watch list for a considerable amount of time. Commander Ian Humes, MI6 spokesperson, notes the coincidence of the cash amount corresponding with the US payments to Iran for hostages, as well as the State Department plastic sheeting. This suggests a potential case of massive fraud against the United States and the world.

The Foundation claims to only be renting the warehouse through an agency, which also happens to be owned by Bin Shalakta, as is the trucking company used in France, Germany and Latkavia. The numerous coincidences are too suspicious to overlook.

Once MI6 has concluded their investigation, they plan to collaborate with the FBI to determine if a connection exists. As always, we will provide updates as the situation unfolds.",rewrite_generation

politifact15371,"President Trump and his administration just voted against a United Nations ban on the death penalty for being gay, making the United States of America (it’s hard to think this is actually really happening) just one of 13 other countries in the world to oppose such a historic vote.A few other notable countries who voted against the ban were China, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.The resolution wasn’t sought to ban the death penalty entirely, but instead to keep it from being imposed in a ‘discriminatory manner,’ particularly in six countries where the death penalty is used for people known to be in same-sex relationships: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen, Nigeria, and Somalia.While some are saying that a ‘no’ vote might imply a rejection of the death penalty in general, The Human Rights Council resolution specifically stated that it condemned the “imposition of the death penalty as a sanction for specific forms of conduct, such as apostasy, blasphemy, adultery and consensual same-sex relations.”To have a ‘no’ vote puts the United States in a very select group of countries. Not exactly the best group to be in agreement with on an issue like this.Renato Sabbadini, the executive director of The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, said:“It is unconscionable to think that there are hundreds of millions of people living in states where somebody may be executed simply because of whom they love.” “This is a monumental moment where the international community has publicly highlighted that these horrific laws simply must end.”Since taking office, Trump has made a number of political appointments and policy moves against the LGBT community, including:Having The Department of Justice and Department of Education rescind guidance that defended the rights of transgender students to safety use bathrooms at schools that correspond to their gender identity.Saying publicly that transgenders could no longer serve in the military, and then issuing a directive to the Department of Defense to implement such an order.Signing an executive order in March that rescinded an Obama-era rule that companies have to prove they treat LGBT employees fairly.Fortunately, the measure passed with 27 countries voting for it, but it still sends a chilling message about a new United States agenda on human rights.",1,en,"President Trump and his administration just voted against a United Nations ban on the death penalty for being gay, making the United States of America (it’s hard to think this is actually really happening) just one of 13 other countries in the world to oppose such a historic vote.A few other notable countries who voted against the ban were China, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.The resolution wasn’t sought to ban the death penalty entirely, but instead to keep it from being imposed in a ‘discriminatory manner,’ particularly in six countries where the death penalty is used for people known to be in same-sex relationships: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen, Nigeria, and Somalia.While some are saying that a ‘no’ vote might imply a rejection of the death penalty in general, The Human Rights Council resolution specifically stated that it condemned the “imposition of the death penalty as a sanction for specific forms of conduct, such as apostasy, blasphemy, adultery and consensual same-sex relations.”To have a ‘no’ vote puts the United States in a very select group of countries.

Notable countries who joined the dissent were China, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. The resolution in question aimed to prevent the discriminatory implementation of capital punishment in six countries, where it is used for individuals in consensual same-sex relationships: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen, Nigeria, and Somalia. It is worth noting that the resolution did not seek to abolish the death penalty altogether.

Despite the ambiguous nature of the resolution, international human rights organizations have condemned the decision of the United States. Renato Sabbadini, the executive director of The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, stated that it is ""unconscionable"" to think that people may face death simply because of their sexual orientation.

This recent vote further highlights a worrisome trend of the Trump administration's policies towards the LGBT community. In recent years, the Department of Justice and Education withdrew guidance that protected the rights of transgender students, transgender individuals were banned from serving in the military, and an executive order was signed rescinding Obama-era rule that protected fair treatment of LGBT employees.

Although the measure ultimately passed, the refusal of the United States to join the 27 other countries in voting for this resolution sends a chilling message about the country's stance on human rights. The international community has come together in support of an end to discriminatory laws, and it is imperative that the United States join this effort.",rewrite_generation

NO MORE . is one example.NFL gives up tax exempt status – Apr. 28, 2015 which was about time. But they still suck off the public teat ","The National Football League (NFL) recently fined the Pittsburgh Steelers one million dollars each for refusing to participate in the national anthem, leading to widespread backlash from football fans. The Commissioner of the NFL was under pressure to issue the first punishment for kneeling protests during national anthems and responded with this penalty. However, some people believe that since Alejandro Villanueva, an American army veteran, chose to stand for the anthem in protest, he should be exempt from the fine. In fact, 50% of the fine should go to him since he was bullied by his coach, team owner, and fellow players. 

Meanwhile, Alejandro Villanueva has publicly apologized for his protest. This has backfired and angered fans even further. The attack on the American flag by other players still remains a contentious issue. Clearly, the NFL is struggling to protect its ideology and enforce its belief system onto others. Villanueva was the sole member of his team to stand up for America and he was forced, under threat of harm to his life and career, to retract his patriotic actions. He deserves an apology from the NFL leadership and his former teammates. 

In a separate incident, Chief Paul Smith of Cecil’s Volunteer Fire Department No. 2 in Muse, Washington County, was rightly punished for making a racist comment about Steelers’ coach Mike Tomlin on Facebook, following the team's decision not to participate in the national anthem. Likewise, some believe that the NFL players should also face harsh penalties for their disrespectful behavior towards the national anthem and the President of the United States. This is causing outrage, and many voted for Trump because of this very reason. 

The NFL has received over $1.1 billion dollars in federal subsidies over the past 20 years. Fans are calling for the government to halt this funding as the current situation showcases that NFL players do not respect their fans, their country, or the President of the United States. Despite playing in taxpayer-funded stadiums, they behave in a manner that many feel is disrespectful and unpatriotic. It's time for the government to cut off NFL funding, and for the NFL to be held accountable for its actions, starting with an apology to Alejandro Villanueva, and penalizing those players who disrespected the national anthem and the President.",rewrite_generation

Returning to the show on Tuesday, Pitt expressed his concern over the worsening state of our planet due to the significant increase in carbon dioxide, which has transformed it into an uninhabitable wasteland. He further added that despite this, half the population remains in denial of this adverse effect on our planet. He also made a biblical reference while discussing the weather, stating ""The Lord saw the wickedness of man was great, and the Lord said, ‘I will destroy man, who I have created, from the face of the Earth.’ So don’t forget your sunscreen."" Coming to political issues, Pitt, despite belonging to a state that mainly supports Trump, questioned the reasons behind people's support for him. He added that he couldn't believe that Trump was in charge and that the idea of taking the country back was confusing since he wasn't sure where it allegedly went. Pitt concluded by emphasizing that good deeds bring people together, while separation and isolation are harmful. He remained optimistic about a sense of interconnectivity in a global neighborhood, even though there is a reactionary push towards isolation and separation. Pitt's message was clear that there is no future for America under the current administration.",rewrite_generation

In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom’s new American arm called Tenam.Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin “did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons … to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,” a November 2014 indictment stated.His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin’s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show.In evidentiary affidavits signed in 2014 and 2015, an Energy Department agent assigned to assist the FBI in the case testified that Mikerin","The FBI had gathered evidence that officials in the Russian nuclear industry were engaged in corrupt activities such as bribery, kickbacks, extortion, and money laundering while attempting to expand their atomic energy business within the United States.

He claimed that the U.S. is turning into Sodom now that it has “enshrined sodomy into the United States Constitution” and cities like Houston are trying to “force women to go into men’s bathrooms and men to go into women’s bathrooms.”“Now it’s a constitutional right for sodomites to marry each other,” he lamented, warning that “the wrath of God is revealed against this stuff.” He explained: “I don’t want the wrath of God to hit this country, it’s a great country, I’d like to see America continue strong, but this is one way of weakening it. First of all, we’re going to have this financial collapse. We’re setting up for a massive financial collapse and I think if God is going to hurt this country that’s probably the way he’d do it.”At that point, a viewer called in and inquired Robertson whether his grim predictions of such a crisis can somehow be averted, to which Robertson gave a somewhat confusing answer: “I believe so, yes, but we need to stop spreading lesbianism and homosexuality in order to achieve that. And the only way to stop the spread of these diseases that are plaguing the country is to make some sort of obvious distinction between gay people and normal, straight people.”“I personally believe that we must impose a rule on the gay population that would require them to wear specially-colored clothes, for example. I’m thinking we need to go through the Senate with this and we need to make it official. That way, regular people would know that the person wearing the said color is a deviant sodomite and that they need to stay away from them at all cost, as well as keep their children away from their reach,” Robertson opined.The viewer then interrupted “The 700 Club” host to state that “that sounds awfully like what Nazis did to Jews in the events leading up to World War II,” referring to the fact that Jews in pre-WWII Poland and Germany were made to wear Jewish badges, or yellow badges, which were cloth patches that Jews were ordered to sew on their outer garments to mark them as Jews in public. It served as a badge of shame.“I don’t believe that,” Robertson quickly became defensive. “I am simply talking about protecting regular people in America, not setting out gays and lesbians as members of the population that should be tortured and slaughtered in concentration camps. Do you understand my point of view here?” the host asked the caller.“I do,” the caller replied. “But I also understand that you’re trying to do to gay people what the Nazis did to my people more than half a century ago.

And the only way to stop the spread of these diseases that are plaguing the country is to make some sort of obvious distinction between gay people and normal, straight people.”“I personally believe that we must impose a rule on the gay population that would require them to wear specially-colored clothes, for example. I’m thinking we need to go through the Senate with this and we need to make it official. That way, regular people would know that the person wearing the said color is a deviant sodomite and that they need to stay away from them at all cost, as well as keep their children away from their reach,” Robertson opined.The viewer then interrupted “The 700 Club” host to state that “that sounds awfully like what Nazis did to Jews in the events leading up to World War II,” referring to the fact that Jews in pre-WWII Poland and Germany were made to wear Jewish badges, or yellow badges, which were cloth patches that Jews were ordered to sew on their outer garments to mark them as Jews in public. It served as a badge of shame.“I don’t believe that,” Robertson quickly became defensive. “I am simply talking about protecting regular people in America, not setting out gays and lesbians as members of the population that should be tortured and slaughtered in concentration camps. Do you understand my point of view here?” the host asked the caller.“I do,” the caller replied. “But I also understand that you’re trying to do to gay people what the Nazis did to my people more than half a century ago. And I am appalled by it.”Click to expand...","Televangelist Pat Robertson has once again expressed his belief that LGBT rights will lead to God destroying America's financial markets. Speaking on ""The 700 Club,"" Robertson warned viewers that God's wrath is imminent. He asserted that the U.S. is becoming like Sodom following the inclusion of ""sodomy"" into the U.S. Constitution, in addition to the enforcement of gender-neutral bathrooms in places like Houston. Robertson expressed concern at the fact that ""sodomites"" can now marry and that ""the wrath of God is revealed against this stuff."" He added that a financial collapse was inevitable and could be the way in which God punishes the country. A caller to the show asked Robertson if this crisis could be avoided, and he suggested that the way forward was to ""make some sort of obvious distinction between gay people and normal, straight people."" Robertson suggested that gay people wear a particular color as a form of identification. The caller compared this to what the Nazis did to Jews in World War II, but Robertson denied this accusation, saying he was trying to protect ordinary Americans and not advocating torture and murder of LGBTQ+ individuals.",rewrite_generation

One of the senior engineers at the social media giant, Clay Haynes, admitted to gaining unauthorized access to President Donald Trump's private data and subsequently leaking it to the Department of Justice. Furthermore, Haynes went on to assert that his team has complete access to all the activity of every user on the site, including the ability to recover deleted messages. 

Haynes' admission reveals Twitter's extreme level of monitoring of its users, which he himself described as ""big brother-ish."" It also confirmed Twitter's disclosure of all direct messages sent by President Trump to the DOJ, including deleted ones. At this time, it remains uncertain whether this information was voluntarily disclosed or obtained via a court order. Twitter is currently facing scrutiny from left-leaning critics who argue that the president should be removed from their platform for violating Twitter's Terms of Service.

Clay Haynes has been employed by Twitter since September 2016, according to his LinkedIn profile. On January 3, 2018, Haynes met with an undercover journalist from Project Veritas at Stookey's Club Moderne in San Francisco. With a hidden video camera, the journalist captures Haynes on camera stating, ""we’re more than happy to help the DOJ with their little investigation"" of President Trump. Haynes goes on to assert that Twitter can also provide every single tweet posted by the president as well as any direct messages and mentions. 

Haynes' political leanings were made abundantly clear in the video. ""He's dangerous, I don't like him and he's a terrible human being and I want to get rid of him,"" he says of President Trump. Haynes also reveals that internal reviews about President Trump had been conducted. 

On January 7, 2018, James O'Keefe, the founder and president of Project Veritas, himself went undercover with Haynes to investigate further. While Haynes stated there is a subpoena process for accessing President Trump's messages, he refused to comment on whether Twitter was working with the Department of Justice in this regard. 

""The fact is, even if Haynes was just speculating about helping Justice, his admission shows a clear and dangerous political bias at the highest levels of Twitter,"" says O'Keefe in the video. ""The question is: by Twitter giving private information about the President to the Justice Department, are they breaking the law, betraying a trust, following an official request or satisfying a political agenda by leading a crusade against the President.""

His trial is on the 31st however police say they doubt he will ever be allowed back into society.","Late last night, Greensburg police received a distressing phone call from a resident who had heard alarming sounds originating from an alleyway near her house. On responding to this complaint, officers were not prepared for the ghastly scene that met their eyes. An investigation revealed that a 21-year-old male, dressed as a clown, was brutally devouring a live cat, which had its legs tied together. Despite the cat's cries for help, the perpetrator sadistically consumed the feline, gradually causing its death. It was only after being approached by the officers that the individual ceased the monstrous act, proceeding instead to stroke the cat. Upon inquiry, he offered the truly chilling explanation of wanting to test if the cat tasted like Chinese food, uttering the disturbing phrase 'curiosity killed the cat.' 

Despite his arrest, the perpetrator exhibited erratic and deeply disturbing behavior. He adamantly refused to provide an identification, claiming to be 'furball munchinsrein the clown.' In custody, he continuously called out to a female officer, ordering her to approach him while exclaiming his desire to taste her flesh, going as far as biting the cell bars. Subsequently, he was transferred to a high-security prison for the criminally insane. Reports suggest that he has bitten his own fingers and used his blood to paint the figure of a clown on himself. He now refuses to answer questions, instead choosing to emit animalistic meows, causing most to believe his insanity to be irreversible. Although a trial is scheduled for the 31st, it is highly unlikely that this individual will ever be deemed fit to re-enter society.",rewrite_generation

After one of those briefings, Senate minority leader Harry Reid wrote FBI Director James Comey, citing reports of meetings between a Trump adviser (a reference to Page) and “high ranking sanctioned individuals” in Moscow over the summer as evidence of “significant and disturbing ties” between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin that needed to be investigated by the bureau.Some of those briefed were “taken aback” when they learned about Page’s contacts in Moscow, viewing them as a possible back channel to the Russians that could undercut U.S. foreign policy, said a congressional source familiar with the briefings but who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject.

Recent reports alleging that Halper received over $1 million from the Department of Defense between 2012 and 2018 for various research projects have led to questions about the payments’ purpose. Halper was responsible for inviting George Papadopolous to London, where he met an Australian diplomat linked to the Clinton Foundation. Trump supporter Jacob Wohl has referred to Halper as the “bag-man” who enabled Brennan and Clapper to spy on Trump’s campaign at Obama’s request. This claim is supported by a recent email from Halper to Trump campaign aide Carter Page, written just months before a FISA warrant was set to expire. In the email, Halper asks Page about his post-election plans and implies that attention has shifted to “controversies” in the White House. Halper and Page were in contact for over a year, meeting frequently and exchanging emails.

Edwards, a presidential historian at Texas A&M, said. “This kind of thing has been going on throughout history, but normally it’s not very much. This is very early in a tenure and to have former presidents being critical of the president… is pretty unusual.”As Obama returns to the public spotlight, his former aides have made it clear he has no intention of talking much about Trump. However, he’s made his displeasure clear.Obama, who campaigned heavily for Hillary Clinton, said he was “heartened” by the protests following Trump’s immigration ban targeting Muslim-majority countries.

Stuart Eizenstat, Carter’s chief domestic policy adviser and a former ambassador, said it usually takes an extraordinary occurrence for a former president to criticize a sitting president.“There’s a recognition that there is something so unique and special about the presidency, that, notwithstanding what might be very deep and serious policy differences and personal understandings, you simply bite your tongue,” he said. “You don’t try to undercut the president because you know what impact that would have had when you were president.”The most reliable politics newsletter.

Former aides say particularly on foreign policy issues, previous presidents and statesmen can be a valuable resource.“Most of the time President Clinton reached out to former heads of state, or people like Henry Kissinger or James Baker, they were usually foreign policy issues, where you had a perspective there that was pretty unique on dealing with a similar situation,” Mack McLarty, Clinton’s former chief of staff, said.For example, Carter worked with former President Gerald Ford on the treaties which turned control of the Panama Canal over to Panama. Eizenstat said Carter instructed negotiator Sol Linowitz to call Ford immediately after the deal was ratified.Others primarily use their predecessors for humanitarian trips. Harry Truman famously sent Hoover to address the post-World War II famine, and George W. Bush had his father and Clinton help with relief efforts for the tsunami in Southeast Asia and Hurricane Katrina. Most recently, Obama sent the younger Bush and Clinton to Haiti to help after the 2010 earthquake.“What would be really unusual is if no former president undertook any missions on behalf of the incumbent president,” Naftali said. “If we see that none of the former presidents want","Former presidents are navigating a delicate balance in Donald Trump’s America, treading a fine line between defending their legacies and respecting the unwritten rule of avoiding public criticism of their successors. President Trump’s “American carnage” inauguration speech directly implied that his predecessors had failed the American people. Reports suggest that George W. Bush called it “some weird s---t” and Jimmy Carter said he “flinched” when Trump hinted at rolling back human rights commitments. The five living former presidents are now striving to uphold their own records while abiding by the conventional etiquette of refraining from undermining the current commander-in-chief. “The immediate former presidents have been more active in their criticism of the current president,” said presidential historian George C. Edwards of Texas A&M. Edwards remarked that while such issues have arisen in history, it is unusual for them to be so public so early in a term. President Obama has been relatively restrained, speaking out in defense of his policies and criticizing Trump’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Meanwhile, George W. Bush has hinted at concerns over the travel ban and Trump’s approach to the press, stressing the importance of a free and independent media in preserving democracy. Carter and Clinton have also voiced their anxieties. While none of their comments are entirely unprecedented, it remains to be seen whether criticism by former presidents will continue at a sustained level. Regardless, the current and former aides of those presidents have stressed that caution is being exercised, recognizing the “unique and special” nature of the presidency and its office.",rewrite_generation

Ms. McCrummen was convicted of a crime punishable by up to six months of imprisonment for writing a hot check that was deemed worthless.Ms. McCrummen’s other offenses are all traffic related and in 2010, she was tracked down by the courts after she had escaped Arizona’s jurisdiction to D.C., and her case was assigned to the Fines/Fees and Restitution Enforcement (FARE) Program established to collect delinquent court ordered restitution, fines, fees, and surcharges . After the FARE team tracked her down at her Washington D.C. apartment, they finally appeared to get her attention and on October 23, 2010 she paid the defaulted fine to the criminal court, almost two months after her conviction. McCrummen has now found herself a four-time loser in the states’ criminal courts.

The show, which has not yet been named, is scheduled to launch later this year and is already being billed as a refreshing departure from the traditional seriousness that has become synonymous with late-night comedy. Wolf is expected to make fun of everything and everybody with no religious, political, or any other kind of agenda unless, of course, it proves to be humorous. Wolf stated that her show's jokes are those that her former bosses told her that could not be done on TV. Netflix's vice president, Bela Bajaria, expressed the company's delight in working with Wolf, whom she praised as a gifted performer and writer with a unique voice.

Wolf's first stand-up special, Nice Lady, aired on rival HBO, earning her significant favorable reviews. In it, she tackled subjects ranging from feminism to dating and social issues. Despite being a relatively new face on the stand-up circuit, Wolf has gained the respect of some comedy heavyweights, including Louis C.K. and Chris Rock, who have each given her the chance to work with them.

By moving to Netflix, Wolf exits Comedy Central and follows in the footsteps of other comedians like John Oliver. In addition to her Daily Show contributions, she created and starred in two digital series, Now Hiring and Used People, for Viacom. Her new show is a much-welcomed addition to the field and comes at a time when women are still underrepresented in the space.

Ron Howard was to take on the role of Richie Cunningham once again, and other original actors include the guys who play Potsie and Malph, a cameo by Henry Winkler while Jon Voight plays Fonzie and an attractive guy who isn’t worth less than the chick from Charles In Charge plays Chachi, who now loves a guy named Jeff.

Streep had made derogatory remarks towards the President during a public event without mentioning his name. As a result of this, Ron Howard, the director of a reboot of Happy Days, in which Streep was set to star, has decided to rescind her contract. The new series was intended to incorporate contemporary themes such as multiracial families, gender identity, and LGBTQ+ representation into its plotlines. However, Howard was forced to pursue other options in light of Streep's behavior. The tragic passing of Florence Henderson, who was originally set to play the older version of Mrs. C, has complicated the casting process even further. Nonetheless, producers remain optimistic about finding a suitable replacement in Deborah from Everybody Loves Raymond. Streep, who has reportedly not worked since her appearance in a film about shoes, is allegedly facing financial difficulties and was counting on the revenue generated from this project to support her retirement. Nevertheless, her current standing as a polarizing figure in the political sphere and perceived irrelevance to Trump supporters has made her casting in this series a difficult prospect moving forward.",rewrite_generation

politifact14155,"HERE Is WHAT WILL HAPPEN If The DEEP STATE TAKES DOWN PRESIDENT TRUMP & It’s NOT PRETTY … FOR THEM“The tree of liberty must be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants.” – Thomas JeffersonELDER PATRIOT – Corrupt politicians ignore Jefferson’s directive to their own detriment. It’s no longer political, it’s personal.Americans have had their eyes opened by the ascension of Donald Trump and no amount of leftwing money can put the Freedom Movement genie back in the bottle.Conservative Senator Ted Cruz made that observation after reviewing the results of the 2016 elections and the expectations of the voters.Cruz, who had the most high profile personality clash with Donald Trump during the Republican primary process nevertheless embraced Trump’s America First agenda and said, “If we’re given the White House and both houses of Congress and we don’t deliver, I think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets. And I think quite rightly.”Candidate Trump promised many things – border control, lower taxes, fairer trade relations, a balanced budget, healthcare that puts the people first not the government, safer communities, and – to the extent possible – an end to foreign wars. What, among those promises, should any Republican, nay any American, have a problem with?After four months without a single legislative achievement, Congressional and Senatorial Republicans – notably John McCain, Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham – have joined the Democrats in investigating President Trump absent a single shred of evidence that an underlying crime has been committed.So, what gives?Well, there was one additional promise that Trump made on his way to the White House that has some Republicans joining with Democrats and quaking in their boots, Trump’s promise to “Drain the Swamp.”As we reported yesterday, “An F.B.I. agent with ‘intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Clinton case’ told us that they uncovered evidence of such massive corruption that the agents involved realized that damned near the entire government could be brought down.”The criminal co-conspirators in both parties realized almost immediately that the new sheriff wasn’t interested in joining them in the swamp so they launched, what can only be characterized as, a coup attempt.Democrats are well schooled in such things probably because of their close alliance with Marxist regimes that can only gain power by seizing it through bloody civil wars. It should be noted that the Democratic Party has already done this once before.One Hundred and Fifty-Seven years ago the Democrats waged a war against the First Republican President Abraham Lincoln for giving Blacks their freedom. That war came at a high price, as many as 700,000 Americans died fighting for what they believe in.

It’s no longer political, it’s personal.Americans have had their eyes opened by the ascension of Donald Trump and no amount of leftwing money can put the Freedom Movement genie back in the bottle.Conservative Senator Ted Cruz made that observation after reviewing the results of the 2016 elections and the expectations of the voters.Cruz, who had the most high profile personality clash with Donald Trump during the Republican primary process nevertheless embraced Trump’s America First agenda and said, “If we’re given the White House and both houses of Congress and we don’t deliver, I think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets. And I think quite rightly.”Candidate Trump promised many things – border control, lower taxes, fairer trade relations, a balanced budget, healthcare that puts the people first not the government, safer communities, and – to the extent possible – an end to foreign wars. What, among those promises, should any Republican, nay any American, have a problem with?After four months without a single legislative achievement, Congressional and Senatorial Republicans – notably John McCain, Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham – have joined the Democrats in investigating President Trump absent a single shred of evidence that an underlying crime has been committed.So, what gives?Well, there was one additional promise that Trump made on his way to the White House that has some Republicans joining with Democrats and quaking in their boots, Trump’s promise to “Drain the Swamp.”As we reported yesterday, “An F.B.I. agent with ‘intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Clinton case’ told us that they uncovered evidence of such massive corruption that the agents involved realized that damned near the entire government could be brought down.”The criminal co-conspirators in both parties realized almost immediately that the new sheriff wasn’t interested in joining them in the swamp so they launched, what can only be characterized as, a coup attempt.Democrats are well schooled in such things probably because of their close alliance with Marxist regimes that can only gain power by seizing it through bloody civil wars. It should be noted that the Democratic Party has already done this once before.One Hundred and Fifty-Seven years ago the Democrats waged a war against the First Republican President Abraham Lincoln for giving Blacks their freedom. That war came at a high price, as many as 700,000 Americans died fighting for what they believe in. To put that in perspective, these casualties exceed the nation’s loss in all its other wars, from the Revolution through Vietnam.Today, Americans are still prepared to fight and die to protect their children’s God-given freedoms.

The battle lines have been drawn and no amount of finger pointing is going to convince these patriots to let anyone overturn the election results.So why are establishment politicians courting a bloodbath on the streets of America that will also threaten them personally when they could be part of Making America Great Again? It’s because they have been caught red-handed and up to their eyeballs in a worldwide criminal conspiracy that has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with defrauding the American taxpayers.And, now that they’ve been caught robbing the world’s largest bank – the U.S. treasury – they have chosen to go out in a blaze of glory rather than try to defend the indefensible at trial.Washington’s criminal elites have chosen to go to war to unseat our duly elected president. It’s time to make our voices heard before this turns very ugly. Buckle your chin strap, America is counting on you.EDITORS NOTE: THIS IS NOT A CALL TO ARMS BUT RATHER AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE DEEP STATES OVERTURNS A DUELY ELECTED PRESIDENT.HERE IS A LIST OF EVERY SINGLE TIME OBAMA COMMITTED AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE THAT DEMS & MEDIA COVERED UP“Impeach!” It’s been more than eight years since Democrats uttered that word – long enough for anyone to wonder if it was still in their vocabulary, considering the deafening silence through the dozens of serious scandals during President Obama’s administration – but now that President Trump is the man in the White House, it’s back with a vengeance.Democrats everywhere are wildly slinging the “I” word, hoping to nail Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors after the New York Times claimed a memo written by former FBI Director James Comey said the president urged him to end the federal investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.Some members of Congress are getting in on the action. They include Reps. Maxine Water, D-Calif., and Al Green, D-Texas. Even a Republican, Rep. Justin Amash, claimed Wednesday there are grounds to impeach President Trump. House Oversign Committee Chair Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, asked for the alleged Comey memo and other documents. Chaffetz tweeted that he is prepared to subpoena the information. And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., invoked “Watergate.”Now the Democratic Party is reportedly poll testing impeachment as a 2018 election issue. More than 1 million people signed a petition calling","The United States is facing a political crisis as the integrity of its democratic institutions is being challenged. President Trump promised to deliver several key policies, such as border control, lower taxes, fairer trade relations, a balanced budget, healthcare reform and an end to foreign wars. However, after four months in office, no legislative achievement has been made. The President’s promise to “Drain the Swamp” and prosecute corrupt officials has caused alarm among the political establishment, leading to what can only be described as a coup attempt against the President. This is a familiar scenario for the Democratic Party, who have a history of waging war against Republican Presidents, with the Civil War costing the lives of 700,000 Americans. 

Today, Americans are still prepared to fight and die for their freedom. The millions of patriots who voted for Trump include military personnel, police officers and NRA members, who are well armed, trained, disciplined and determined to protect their children’s God-given freedoms. These patriots have been disgusted by the corruption in Washington and are prepared to defend their elected President by force. The President’s administration will move forward politically, but it may also be advanced by the patriots who support him.

The political crisis is due to the criminal elites in Washington, who have been caught up in a worldwide criminal conspiracy to defraud the American taxpayers. They have been caught red-handed and are now courting a bloodbath on the streets of America, which will also threaten them personally. It is time to make our voices heard before this turns very ugly. This is not a call to arms, but rather an analysis of what would happen if the deep state overturns a duly elected President. America is counting on you to speak out against this attempted coup.",rewrite_generation

The resulting loss of life highlights a broader ethical and environmental concern around unregulated commercial whaling practices.",rewrite_generation

Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, sheds light on Michelle's behavior and its possible underlying reasons. According to Wright, Michelle has become an ""attack dog"" in an effort to help her husband build his legacy. Wright explains that Michelle is in ""legacy building mode"" and that she does not have to worry about the implications of her remarks for months to come. As such, she is most free to say what she feels, believes, and wants the message to be for the public. 

One of Michelle's most disturbing claims against the country was that America is a racist nation that needed her husband in office, and that she is now feeling a sense of ""hopelessness"" with Trump in office. Michelle also claimed that she was never proud of America until her husband got elected to the White House. However, Wright points out that first ladies, including Michelle, give more public remarks than vice presidents. 

Moreover, Michelle's lunch program failed miserably, and even her biggest supporters criticized the changes she made to school meals. President Trump reversed all of Michelle's actions and gave children back their chocolate milk that had been removed under her watch. Many view Michelle's actions as revenge against a president who opposes her husband's policies. While opinions about Michelle vary widely, it is clear that her behavior has contributed to ongoing discussions about her legacy and her impact on the nation.",rewrite_generation

politifact14384,"Photo: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesPeter Strzok, the FBI agent who sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails and Russia’s involvement in the Trump campaign, has said he’s willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, or any other committee that wants to talk with him. This could lead to dramatic hearings, as Strzok could expose more information about those probes, and is central to President Trump’s effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.Reports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBI’s conduct during the 2016 election. Strzok’s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok “intends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him.”The letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.” The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with “specific investigative decisions,” but said that comment and others “implies a willingness to take official action.”Strzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldn’t be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trump’s odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that there’s “no question” that Strzok regrets sending the messages, but that “I think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation, and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation.”Mueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts.Goelman said that if asked to testify, Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity, and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. He said the agent “intends to answer any question put to him, and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation, the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that that’s a topic, and his own integrity.”Trump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night, which are not supported by the inspector general’s findings. The report did not cover the Russia probe, though that did not stop Trump’s allies from calling for Mueller’s immediate suspension.Why was the FBI’s sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that “we’ll stop” Trump from becoming President?

Strzok's cooperation could reveal vital information about these probes, which are central to President Trump's campaign to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. The House Judiciary Committee's chairman, Bob Goodlatte, had reportedly been considering subpoenaing Strzok, but his attorney, Aitan Goelman, stated that Strzok is willing to testify voluntarily, thus rendering a subpoena unnecessary. Goelman also emphasized that Strzok had fully cooperated with the Department of Justice's inspector general, who had criticized the agent's conduct. During the lead-up to the 2016 election, Strzok and Lisa Page, a former FBI lawyer with whom he was having an affair, had exchanged anti-Trump messages on government-issued phones. Although the inspector general found no evidence that Strzok and Page's views impacted any decisions, he affirmed that Strzok's ""willingness to take official action"" was implied. Goelman doubts that Strzok's messages will have any impact on Mueller's investigation and argues that attempts to discredit the investigation are unnecessary. Additionally, Strzok's lawyer has declared that if the agent is asked to testify, he is willing to do so without immunity or the protection of his Fifth Amendment rights, and he ""intends to defend the integrity"" of both the Clinton email and Russia collusion investigations, as well as his own integrity. While Mueller removed Strzok from his investigation after discovering the texts, it is currently unknown what Strzok's current role within the FBI entails, and he is one of five people whom the inspector general referred to the FBI's disciplinary office.",rewrite_generation

Despite efforts by some to impeach the President, Parton stands firmly in support of Trump.

Parton, who was once a liberal and a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton, has recently changed her views on the former presidential hopeful. In a previous statement, Parton spoke positively about Clinton's potential to become the first female President of the United States, stating that ""we’ve certainly come a long way in that respect"". However, she has since come to the realization that Hillary would not have been a suitable candidate to champion the rights of women across the country due to her perceived dishonesty and corruption.

In a recent interview, Parton voiced her opinion on the Clinton campaign, describing it as ""just crazy"" and calling Clinton ""nuts"". It is important to note that the American News article which quotes Parton inaccurately and out of context has used portions of a real interview she gave to CNN on 26 August 2016.

Regardless, Parton's stance on Trump remains unwavering and she stands with him ""now and forever"". Do you share her support for the President?",rewrite_generation

politifact15492,"January 2nd, 2005, was a very important day in seven-year-old Katie Flynn’s life.She was one of the flower girls at her aunt Lisa’s wedding, along with her younger sister Grace.Over 200 friends and relatives had gathered on a beach in Long Island to witness Lisa and David exchange their vows and join in holy matrimony.The guests watched on as Katie and Grace walked down the isle with their beautiful dresses and innocent smiles – but nobody could have known this was to be the last day of young Katie’s life.After a long day of love, laughter and festivities, the bride’s parents, Christopher and Denice, along with her sister, Jennifer, Jennifer’s husband, Neil, and their two young daughters, Katie and Grace, got in the limousine that would take them home.“I remember looking in on the limo and seeing Kate and waving goodbye and she waved goodbye and never thought that was going to be the type of moment where you’re seeing people for the last time,” the groom, David, told CNN.The limousine left the Long Island wedding and joined the highway. They could never have known that a drunk 24-year-old, Marin Heidgen, was also on the road. Heidgen, driving on the wrong side of the road, hit the limo head-on, causing a devastating accident.Police reports revealed that Heidgen’s blood alcohol level was more than three times the legal limit. He had consumed at least 14 drinks and had been driving at 70 miles an hour, on the wrong side of the highway, for at least two miles before the catastrophic accident occurred.The driver of the limousine, 59-year-old Stanley Rabinowitz, was killed instantly after being crushed by the engine. The bride’s father, Christopher, broke both of his legs in several places after being thrown to the floor. He later had to have one amputated. His wife, Denise, was also seriously injured, and little Grace was stuck in the folds of the wreckage.Despite having a broken back, Neil attempted to crawl from the car to seek help. Meanwhile, Jennifer, who had injured her foot, was desperately searching for Katie, who had been lying on the side seat at the time of the crash.Then, Jennifer Flynn came across something that no mother should ever have to witness – her daughter, Katie, had been decapitated by her own seat-belt.One of the first responders on the scene was Michael Tangney, the bride’s uncle and a policeman himself. He had been at the wedding just hours before:“I was walking to the rear of the limousine when a gentleman was coming away from it, and he said, ‘Don’t go back there. It’s bad,’” Michael Tangney said. “I opened the rear door to the limousine and realized it was my family.”But, tragically, the worst was yet to come.Michael Tagney would witness Jennifer emerging from the wreck with her daughter’s head in her hands. Katie’s body remained in the car, still in the dress she had proudly worn for the wedding only a few hours previous.For the next hour, Jennifer sat next to the road. She kept Katie’s head on her lap and watched as the rest of her family was freed from the wreckage of the destroyed vehicle.Eventually, she let her daughter go; handing her to Michael. Before she did so, she kissed her daughter’s face one last time.The event altered the lives of the whole family.

But perhaps few are as heart-wrenching as that of the Flynn family.

On January 2nd, 2005, the family was celebrating the love and union of Katie Flynn’s aunt Lisa and her new husband, David, at a beach wedding in Long Island. Katie, only seven years old, was one of the flower girls and got to share in the magic of the day with her younger sister Grace.

But as the festivities came to a close, the family got into a limousine to head home. Unbeknownst to them, a drunk 24-year-old by the name of Martin Heidgen was driving on the wrong side of the highway, having consumed at least 14 drinks that evening. He collided head-on with the limousine, causing a catastrophic accident.

The driver of the limousine was killed instantly, and the bride’s father and mother suffered serious injuries. To make matters worse, Jennifer Flynn discovered her daughter, Katie, had been decapitated by her own seat-belt. She held her daughter’s head in her hands, still in the dress she had worn for the wedding just hours before.

Michael Tangney, a policeman and the bride’s uncle, witnessed the horror as it unfolded. Though Martin Heidgen was sentenced to 18 years in prison for two counts of second-degree murder, nothing can bring back Jennifer’s daughter.

Jennifer and Neil have bravely shared their story in the hopes that it might prevent similar tragedies from happening in the future. They hope that by experiencing the devastation that they have survived, people can see the severity of drunk driving as the crime it truly is.

The Flynn family’s heartbreaking loss serves as a reminder of the devastating consequences that come with such recklessness. Let us remember their story and work towards a safer future for all.",rewrite_generation
politifact15494,"A dispute in Angela Merkel’s coalition over migration policy has swiftly escalated into one of the biggest tests of her chancellorship.The clash has opened a rift at the heart of the German leader’s own camp, between her Christian Democratic Union and its CSU Bavarian sister party. How the conflict is resolved will determine the chancellor’s fate, possibly as soon as Monday.Horst Seehofer, Merkel’s interior minister and the leader of Bavaria’s Christian Social Union, wants to force through a plan to send back migrants who have already registered for asylum in other European Union states. Merkel rejects the proposal as offloading the burden on neighboring states, and says it would kill efforts to forge a bloc-wide response to the continent’s struggle with migration.Bavarian lawmakers are fully behind Seehofer, while Merkel has wrested a majority in the larger CDU group for her position. The standoff is a replay of tensions that have periodically bubbled up between Merkel and Seehofer since the height of the refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016, only this time there is no obvious way out. Following are some potential scenarios:CompromiseThe two parties have managed to eke out a compromise after each previous conflict. Overtures could begin on Monday, when the CSU party executive meets in Munich. Seehofer could give Merkel what she wants: two weeks to forge bilateral accords with countries such as Italy and Greece to return registered asylum seekers.Merkel could also give ground, as for example the newspaper Die Welt advocates. She could put forward another proposal to assuage the CSU that may yield a compromise. But if she caves in to the Bavarian demands as they stand, it would be an unprecedented loss of authority that would render her a lame duck leader.No CompromiseIn the absence of a face-saving deal, the real clash could come as early as Monday. That’s when Seehofer has indicated he will start to implement his plan at the border. As interior minister, Seehofer has the authority to do so, even in the face of Merkel’s rejection. The only way for the chancellor to forestall a unilateral decision by her minister would be to fire him. Sacking her top Bavarian ally would be a historic first. If it happens, it’s hard to see how the coalition continues.Even if it doesn’t come to that and Merkel is given until the June 28-29 EU summit to reach bilateral agreements, it may only delayed the clash, since there is no guarantee she can win deals with other other EU states. She has already called the prospect ambitious.Confidence voteFor a coalition to dissolve, the German constitution says the lower house of parliament, or Bundestag, has to call a vote of confidence. The CDU and CSU, with a combined 246 seats, and the SPD with 153, have a majority of 44 seats in the 709-seat Bundestag. Such a move would be the ultimate measure of support for Merkel as chancellor. Even if she is unable to rely on the CSU, or indeed all of her own party’s votes, on the specific issue of her stand on migration Merkel might be able to attract the support of the Greens, which have 67 seats.Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in an opinion piece on Friday that Merkel should short-circuit the squabbling and put her parliamentary support to the test with a confidence vote. It’s a tactic that her predecessor, Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, used to force through military support for the U.S. after the Sept. 11 attacks. He used it again in 2005 amid a party rebellion, and this time lost the confidence motion, forcing new elections.Merkel resignsShould the chancellor view her authority as irretrievably compromised, she could throw in the towel. The Bundestag would be forced to elect a new chancellor to replace her, most likely from the CDU. Unless the governing parties agree to continue the coalition under a new leader, Germany’s ninth chancellor since World War II would serve in a caretaker capacity through to a new election.Split on the rightThe CDU and the CSU ar",1,en,"A dispute in Angela Merkel’s coalition over migration policy has swiftly escalated into one of the biggest tests of her chancellorship.The clash has opened a rift at the heart of the German leader’s own camp, between her Christian Democratic Union and its CSU Bavarian sister party.

Merkel rejects the proposal as offloading the burden on neighboring states, and says it would kill efforts to forge a bloc-wide response to the continent’s struggle with migration.Bavarian lawmakers are fully behind Seehofer, while Merkel has wrested a majority in the larger CDU group for her position. The standoff is a replay of tensions that have periodically bubbled up between Merkel and Seehofer since the height of the refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016, only this time there is no obvious way out. Following are some potential scenarios:CompromiseThe two parties have managed to eke out a compromise after each previous conflict. Overtures could begin on Monday, when the CSU party executive meets in Munich. Seehofer could give Merkel what she wants: two weeks to forge bilateral accords with countries such as Italy and Greece to return registered asylum seekers.Merkel could also give ground, as for example the newspaper Die Welt advocates. She could put forward another proposal to assuage the CSU that may yield a compromise. But if she caves in to the Bavarian demands as they stand, it would be an unprecedented loss of authority that would render her a lame duck leader.No CompromiseIn the absence of a face-saving deal, the real clash could come as early as Monday. That’s when Seehofer has indicated he will start to implement his plan at the border. As interior minister, Seehofer has the authority to do so, even in the face of Merkel’s rejection. The only way for the chancellor to forestall a unilateral decision by her minister would be to fire him. Sacking her top Bavarian ally would be a historic first. If it happens, it’s hard to see how the coalition continues.Even if it doesn’t come to that and Merkel is given until the June 28-29 EU summit to reach bilateral agreements, it may only delayed the clash, since there is no guarantee she can win deals with other other EU states. She has already called the prospect ambitious.Confidence voteFor a coalition to dissolve, the German constitution says the lower house of parliament, or Bundestag, has to call a vote of confidence. The CDU and CSU, with a combined 246 seats, and the SPD with 153, have a majority of 44 seats in the 709-seat Bundestag. Such a move would be the ultimate measure of support for Merkel as chancellor. Even if she is unable to rely on the CSU, or indeed all of her own party’s votes, on the specific issue of her stand on migration Merkel might be able to attract the support of the Greens, which have 67 seats.Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in an opinion piece on Friday that Merkel should short-circuit the squabbling and put her parliamentary support to the test with a confidence vote. It’s a tactic that her predecessor, Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, used to force through military support for the U.S. after the Sept. 11 attacks. He used it again in 2005 amid a party rebellion, and this time lost the confidence motion, forcing new elections.Merkel resignsShould the chancellor view her authority as irretrievably compromised, she could throw in the towel. The Bundestag would be forced to elect a new chancellor to replace her, most likely from the CDU. Unless the governing parties agree to continue the coalition under a new leader, Germany’s ninth chancellor since World War II would serve in a caretaker capacity through to a new election.Split on the rightThe CDU and the CSU ar","A dispute has arisen within Angela Merkel’s coalition regarding migration policy, which has now escalated into one of the biggest tests of her chancellorship. The conflict has opened a rift between Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union and its CSU Bavarian sister party, which will ultimately determine the fate of the German leader. Horst Seehofer, Merkel’s interior minister and the leader of Bavaria’s Christian Social Union, is aiming to enforce a plan to send back migrants who have already registered for asylum in other European Union states. However, Merkel has rejected this proposal, stating that it would offload the burden on neighbouring states and ultimately impede any effort to establish a bloc-wide response to Europe’s struggle with migration.

The standoff between the two parties is reminiscent of past tensions that have periodically occurred between Merkel and Seehofer since the refugee crisis of 2015-2016, however, this time there is no apparent solution. As the political world watches in anticipation, multiple potential scenarios have been identified: the parties could agree to a compromise, a face-saving deal may not be found, Merkel may face a vote of confidence, or she may resign as chancellor. The decision made by Merkel and her coalition will have significant consequences for the immediate future of German politics.",rewrite_generation

They allege Nuncera referred to African-Americans using several racial slurs and told his officers to position police dogs at high school basketball games to specifically intimidate African-Americans.Nucera abruptly retired in February after he learned his use of racially motivated force was under investigation. He was making $151,418.31 per year. Nucera draws an annual pension of $105,992.76 — $8,832.73 per month — according to public records.Sixty-year-old Nucera is facing a hate crime charge and a federal civil rights charge. FBI Special Agent Vernon Addison wrote in an affidavit that Nucera “has a significant history of making racist comments concerning African Americans, to whom he frequently referred to as ‘n*ggers'”. One of Nucera’s officers “made numerous recordings” of Nucera that “contained extremely offensive racist comments” over the course of a year because he was “alarmed” by Nucera’s racism, according to the affidavit.The federal charges against Nucera relate to a Sept. 1, 2016, police encounter involving an 18-year-old African-American man and 16-year-old African-American girl. A hotel manager called police because he said the pair hadn’t paid for their hotel room the night before and were swimming in the hotel pool. The FBI affidavit states that their encounter with police “escalated into a physical struggle,” that both teens “resisted arrest” and that one of the officers used pepper spray.AdvertisementAfter both teens were handcuffed, Nucera grabbed the 18-year-old’s head and slammed it “into the right side of the metal doorjamb,” according to the affidavit. An officer heard the 18-year-old’s head make “a loud thud” as it hit the doorjamb, the feds alleged. Officers said the 18-year-old wasn’t resisting when Nucera slammed his head, but had “stopped walking for a moment to loudly complain.” The use of force wasn’t reported to the department.Hours after the assault, Nucera was recorded telling an officer he was “f*cking tired” of African-Americans.“I’ll tell you what, it’s gonna get to the point where I could shoot one of these motherfuckers,” Nucera allegedly said. “And that n*ggerr bitch lady, she almost got it,” he said, referring to the 16-year-old girl’s aunt, who was present at the arrest. “Fucking nipple hanging bitch. I’m so tired of them, man.”Nucera allegedly said that black people should “stay the fuck out of Bordentown” and referred to the 18-year-old as “fucking little, fucking n****r.”In a separate incident noted in the report that occurred in November 2015, Nucera said he wished an African-American from Trenton who he believed had slashed the tires of a police vehicle would give him a reason to “put my hands” on him.“These n****rs are like ISIS, they have no value,” Nucera allegedly said. “They should line them all up and mow ’em down. I’d like to be on the firing squad, I could do it. I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not, I could do it, I’m tired of it.”“The conduct alleged is shocking,” acting US Attorney William E.

Some liberals were quick to jump on these images, using them as proof of President Donald Trump’s perceived cruelty towards illegal immigrants. However, their outrage has backfired as it has been revealed that the photos are not recent but date back to 2014 when Barack Obama was President. 

While Democrats will do anything to undermine Trump’s work, their actions in disseminating these images have only exposed their hypocrisy. In the past, they have insulted Melania Trump, criticized Trump’s children’s mental health and edited videos to portray the President in a negative light. 

But the recent media frenzy over these cage-like cells has brought to light the fact that liberals did not care when Obama was treating children like animals, nor did they ever demand answers from his government. This highlights how their outrage towards Trump is merely a reaction to his stance on immigration. Trump’s main priority is to protect the border from crime and terrorism; he is not treating illegal immigrants like animals. While Trump has referred to MS-13 members as “animals,” Democrats have remained silent on the issue, preferring to criticize his every move. 

In conclusion, the recent outrage over photos of arrested illegal immigrants in cage-like cells demonstrates the hypocrisy of liberal Democrats. By exposing Obama’s poorly-handled immigration policies, they have inadvertently proven that their outrage towards Trump is merely a political ploy.",rewrite_generation

But he said the principal reportedly told him it was for the “students to express themselves.”COLLEGE STUDENT KICKED OUT OF CLASS FOR TELLING PROFESSOR THERE ARE ONLY TWO GENDERSThis left Jacob wondering if it was a memorial for the lives lost or a show of support for gun control.He decided, instead, to stay in class for about 20 minutes doing homework after his teacher and fellow classmates left and locked the door.When they returned, he was slapped with a suspension.Jacob’s father, Scott Shoemaker, said his son was just trying to stay neutral – and did nothing wrong.“Politics [doesn’t] belong in the school,” he said. “Students shouldn’t be pressured into taking a side.”STUDENT WITH ‘TRUMP’ FLAG ASSAULTED BY MOB DURING NATIONAL SCHOOL WALKOUTThe story went viral after Jacob sent a photo of his out-of-school suspension citation to one of his friends, who posted it on social media.The school, as well as the Shoemakers, have received death threats and hate messages.Scott Shoemaker said his son was just trying to be introspective – and he wasn’t acting out.“He didn’t do anything to deserve this,” he said. “He didn’t ask for this.”CHICAGO STUDENTS ALLEGEDLY TRASH WALMART DURING NATIONAL SCHOOL WALKOUT PROTESTThe district says it's responsible for students' safety and they can't be unsupervised.The Associated Press contributed to this report.","A senior student at Hilliard Davidson High School in Ohio has been suspended for his decision to stay in class during the National Walkout Day over gun violence, rather than participate in the protests or attending study hall. Jacob Shoemaker said he wanted to remain apolitical and did not want to take sides in the gun-control debate that has gripped the country. If he had gone outside, he believed he would be supporting gun control, whereas if he stayed inside, he feared he would be seen to be supporting gun violence and disrespecting the 17 lives lost in last month's Florida high school shooting. Shoemaker had held discussions with the principal to understand the purpose of the walkout, but only received a response that it was meant for ""students to express themselves"". It remains unclear if the walkout was a memorial for the Parkland victims or a show of support for gun control. The school district claims responsibility for students’ safety, necessitating supervision, but Shoemaker’s father insists that neutrality was his son’s sole motivation and that politics have no place in schools, adding that his family have subsequently received death threats and abuse.",rewrite_generation

The immigration rules will prohibit migrants from coming to the country and taking advantage of free American welfare money right away.

The idea seems to be that in order for America to grant Visas or citizenship, the migrant has to give something back to the country. It’s as though the government wants to stop people coming to America and living off the system and would prefer people coming to the country to be contributors. Do something for America and America will do something for you.Migrants to those countries must compete for a limited number of visas by gaining points for English proficiency, competitive training, a job offer or another major achievement that benefits the host country.The concept, which is modeled after similar programs from Australia and Canada, is taking harsh criticism from activists. It’s like they want an open border policy where everyone gets free welfare money, but that would just be the downfall of America.

Those folks should be deported because of their bad behavior and often violent crimes they commit on American people and even other immigrants.If America prevents immigrants from getting free benefits for five years, then that makes people think twice about coming here. If a family who thinks about crossing the border to start a new life knows that they cannot live for free, then they may not come at all.

The new immigration rules will prohibit migrants from immediately taking advantage of welfare benefits upon arrival in the United States. This move aims to slow down or halt chain migration, while also protecting the American workforce and potentially reducing the burden on taxpayers.

Previously, migrants would migrate to the United States and rely solely on welfare benefits, which is considered as welfare abuse. While America remains open to migrants, the country may not necessarily want individuals who cannot support themselves. It might be more beneficial for self-sufficient individuals to migrate to America, reducing the number of citizens living off the system.

President Trump has proposed a merit-based Green card system for migrants vying for Visas. By participating in this system, migrants can earn points by learning English, receiving job training or offers, or engaging in other activities that benefit America. The aim seems to be a system in which individuals give back to the country in order to receive Visas or citizenship. This approach aims to prevent people from migrating to America and living off the system, instead encouraging people to be contributors.

This concept is similar to programs in Australia and Canada, albeit receiving harsh criticism from activists who advocate an open border policy, which could have devastating consequences for America. Recent examples of crime in Germany following Merkel's ""come on in"" policy demonstrate how unchecked migration can lead to catastrophic outcomes. The proposed system, however, could prevent further issues from arising, particularly in sanctuary cities with a high number of illegal immigrant criminals, who commit violence against American citizens and even other immigrants. These individuals should face deportation due to their bad behavior.

Preventing immigrants from obtaining financial benefits from the country for a defined period of time is likely to act as a deterrent. If a family is considering entering the country to start a new life, the knowledge that they will be unable to rely on welfare could discourage them from making the journey. If individuals have a job at their disposal and the ability to integrate successfully with society instantly, it would be a perfect match. America is the land of the free, although it is not a land of free money.

President Trump has made it clear that migrants who enter the United States will not be able to receive welfare for the first five years following their arrival, as per his immigration overhaul. The president's weekly radio address stated that the new merits-based Green Card system is designed to prevent abuse of the welfare system, curtail chain migration, and safeguard the American workforce and economy. As a result, migrants will no longer be able to receive welfare upon immediate entry to America and must pledge to avoid using welfare systems for a five-year period.

When comparing America to Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the border to millions of unvetted migrants who struggle with language skills and lack employable qualifications, we see an approach doomed to perpetual welfare paid for by German taxpayers. Tragically, this often results in boredom manifesting itself in terrorist attacks against German taxpayers. Recent statistics reveal that only 2.8% of over 1.2 million migrants in Germany have obtained jobs. However, these statistics might be misleading, as suggested by some.",rewrite_generation

During his appearance at the South by South Lawn event hosted at the White House on Monday night, the actor spoke about his desire to travel to the red planet with President Barack Obama.   DiCaprio, together with climate scientist Dr. Katharine Hayhoe, joined the president on stage in a conversation about climate change and environmental conservation before the US premiere of DiCaprio’s thought-provoking documentary ""Before the Flood"". The discussion evolved into the topic of space travel and Mars when Dr. Hayhoe talked about the need to encourage people to connect on a more universal and human level. Obama jokingly expressed his understanding that DiCaprio might be crazy to entertain this dream while Hayhoe attempted to assure him that he was not in fact insane. Nonetheless, DiCaprio stood his ground, affirming his ambition to journey to space on SpaceX. Whether this is a genuine aspiration or motivated by Method acting is yet to be confirmed. Nevertheless, given his unrelenting commitment to his craft, one can only speculate whether this could be his most daring role yet.",rewrite_generation

These innocent children, many of whom were migrants, were consequently subjected to sexual abuse, forced labor and starvation. Shockingly, the fate of many still remains unknown. Local law enforcement uncovered the illegal operation and an inquiry was launched into the federal government's inadequate handling of migrants. Senator Rob Portman, Chairman of the Subcommittee, described the situation as ""intolerable"" and condemned the involvement of a U.S. government agency in delivering children into the hands of abusers. As the crisis continued and detention centers overfilled, the Department of Health and Human Services placed children into sponsor care. However, officials failed to properly screen the adults volunteering to care for the minors, leaving them at risk of exploitation. From 2013 to 2015, check-in visits were performed at only 5% of the caregivers' homes. In the report built on an Associated Press finding, over two dozen children were placed in homes where they suffered abuse and servitude. HHS suggested they lacked the necessary resources to properly screen volunteers. Nevertheless, the investigation discovered that the agency did not allocate all the funds provided for the crisis.

Waters was charged with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code.According to The Hill’s report from 2010:The House ethics committee on Monday outlined its charges against Rep. Maxine Waters, who is accused of helping a bank in which her husband owned stock secure federal bailout funds. The committee charged the 10-term California Democrat with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code in connection with her effort to arrange a 2008 meeting between Treasury officials and representatives with OneUnited bank. The panel said Waters, who sits on the Financial Services Committee, broke a House rule requiring members to behave in a way that reflects “creditably” on the chamber. The committee said that by trying to assist OneUnited, she stood to benefit directly, because her husband owned a sizable amount of stock that would have been “worthless” if the bank failed. The committee also accused Waters of violating the “spirit” of a House rule prohibiting lawmakers from using their positions for financial gain, as well as a government ethics statute banning the dispensing of “special favors.”The charges were delayed and stalled by members of the committee, and multiple attorneys in the case were fired. Ultimately, Waters was absolved of the charges.According to National Review:[Waters] walked away with a slap on the wrist from the toothless House Ethics Committee in 2012 after being charged with multiple ethics violations related to her meddling in minority-owned OneUnited Bank … As stockholders, they profited handsomely from their relationship with the bank. It was a mutually beneficial relationship. After Waters’s office personally intervened and lobbied the Treasury Department in 2008, OneUnited received $12 million in federal TARP bailout money — despite another government agency concluding that the bank operated “without effective underwriting standards” and engaged “in speculative investment practices. After the federal bailout of Fannie/Freddie, OneUnited’s stock in the government-sponsored enterprises plunged to a value estimated at less than $5 million.

However, her history as a government official came under legal scrutiny back in 2010. Waters, who served as a 10-term California Democrat, was charged with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code. 

According to a report by The Hill in 2010, the House ethics committee charged Waters with assisting OneUnited bank, in which her husband owned stock, to secure federal bailout funds. The committee accused Waters of violating House rules that require members to act in a manner that reflects “creditably” on the chamber.

Rosalynn Carter underwent surgery to remove a benign lump from her breast in April 1977. Weeks after Betty Ford became first lady, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy in September 1974.The first lady did not move to Washington until six months into the administration, choosing to let their son, Barron, finish the 2017 school year in New York. More recently, Melania Trump has had a more public profile. On April 24, she and the President hosted the first official state dinner of the Trump administration, an event that was planned and executed primarily by the first lady.Trump was responsible for every aspect of the formal dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, from the hand-selected ivory tablecloths to the menu, which the first lady designed to meld American food with French influence. During the welcome ceremony leading up to the dinner, Melania Trump stole headlines, wearing a crisp white Michael Kors Collection suit with a matching white hat, custom-made by her personal couturier. The hat set the internet ablaze, with references and comparisons to Beyoncé, the suffragette movement and even television character Olivia Pope of ""Scandal.""On May 7, Trump, a relatively private first lady by comparison to her most recent predecessors, was once again front and center, this time to unveil her formal platform, Be Best .

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 14, 2018Trump, who turned 48 last month, had surgery at Walter Reed in nearby Bethesda, Maryland, on Monday morning.She is the first US first lady to undergo such a serious medical procedure while in the White House since Nancy Reagan had a mastectomy in October 1987. Rosalynn Carter underwent surgery to remove a benign lump from her breast in April 1977. Weeks after Betty Ford became first lady, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy in September 1974.The first lady did not move to Washington until six months into the administration, choosing to let their son, Barron, finish the 2017 school year in New York. More recently, Melania Trump has had a more public profile. On April 24, she and the President hosted the first official state dinner of the Trump administration, an event that was planned and executed primarily by the first lady.Trump was responsible for every aspect of the formal dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, from the hand-selected ivory tablecloths to the menu, which the first lady designed to meld American food with French influence. During the welcome ceremony leading up to the dinner, Melania Trump stole headlines, wearing a crisp white Michael Kors Collection suit with a matching white hat, custom-made by her personal couturier. The hat set the internet ablaze, with references and comparisons to Beyoncé, the suffragette movement and even television character Olivia Pope of ""Scandal.""On May 7, Trump, a relatively private first lady by comparison to her most recent predecessors, was once again front and center, this time to unveil her formal platform, Be Best . She kicked off the initiative with a Rose Garden speech lasting 11 minutes, the longest public speaking engagement during her 16-month tenure as first lady.Be Best is a three-pronged platform with a focus on opioid addiction and families, general physical and emotional well-being of children, and kindness and safety for kids using social media.

According to a document on the FDA’s website, a vaccine manufacturer openly confesses that their product can lead to autism as among numerous other unfavorable reactions.

Reports on adverse events resulting from post-approval utilization of the Tripedia vaccine such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), Cellulitis, Anaphylactic Reaction, Hypotonia, Encephalopathy, Convulsion/Grand Mal Convulsion, Apnea, Neuropathy, Somnolence, and Autism are all listed as a part of the FDA's Biologics Blood Vaccines documentation. The reason behind their inclusion is either due to their seriousness or frequency of reporting. However, voluntary reporting by persons from a population of uncertain size, it's not easy to accurately set the frequencies or prove a causal connection between the ingredients that compose the Tripedia vaccine.

Also included in the text is a statement indicating that the Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Concentrates used by The Research Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University (BIKEN), Osaka, Japan, in the vaccine's production, holds a US license and is combined with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids prepared by Sanofi Pasteur Inc. Tripedia vaccine is therefore created by Sanofi Pasteur Inc. and is filled, labelled, packaged then released.

The Tripedia vaccine contains the following ingredients as stated on its package insert: glucose, salt, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals found in Mueller and Miller medium as well as tris hydrochloride, tris base, glutamate, salt, monopotassium phosphate, magnesium chloride, ferrous sulfate, calcium chloride, niacin, glutathione, proline, and ascorbic acid for the Stainer-Scholte medium. Other components include bovine extract, formaldehyde, ammonium sulfate, aluminum potassium sulfate, gelatin, and polysorbate 80.

The package insert contains a warning that the vaccine may cause adverse reactions in some children; these reactions include MSG's excitotoxin effects, allergic reactions due to casein allergenicity, mercury derivative's thimerosal content, aluminum, formaldehyde, gelatin, and polysorbate 80.

Despite these documented risks, many doctors continue to advocate for the use of DTaP vaccines in children while ignoring the negative consequences. A change is needed to stop the use of vaccines with multiple risky elements in infants, toddlers, teens, and adults. It is time for Congress to repeal the “Get out of Jail Free” card for vaccine producers and the aggressive spread of ASD, which is emotionally, financially, and physically exhausting families to the point of separation and ruin. Therefore, utmost priority should be given to making vaccines open to the public.",rewrite_generation

Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis. “We thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time there’s been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting”, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. “They are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal”, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. “Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern”, said Dr. Polowotski. “Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution”. The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill, both of Romeo. “We were just, you know, taking an evening walk along the beach, heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it”, said Bob. “We were singing, drinking whiskey out of the bottle, not thinking about tomorrow.

Upon examination, Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski confirmed that the specimen was a rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis, measuring 21 feet in length. This discovery proves to be extremely significant, as it is the first documented instance of the species in Lake Michigan. 

It appears that the squid may have originated from Cleveland Sea World, where a few young squid managed to escape during a great Northeast blackout in 2003 and entered Lake Erie. However, Dr. Polowotski assures the public that the squid remained within Lake Erie, unable to navigate the shallow and narrow Detroit River. “These creatures require an expansive and open habitat”, she explains. 

The examination of the squid’s body revealed that it was female and had recently laid eggs. Dr. Polowotski advises caution to boaters and swimmers, as this news may have implications for the lake’s ecosystem. “It is hoped that the local walleye population will maintain control over any further squid offspring”, she states.

The attack left Meyer hospitalized with a plethora of injuries which included a swollen and bleeding eye socket, a burst lip and a possible broken nose. This violent attack on an elderly man has shocked the nation as it represents an intolerant and fascist mindset that we, as a society, should strive to eradicate. Meyer's wife, Baroness Catherine Meyer, has expressed her dismay at the appalling incident, stating that it was politically motivated, and she was heartbroken by the brutal beating. The British Transport Police were quick to respond to the attack, arresting two teenagers on suspicion of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm. London has been plagued with rising crime rates over the past year, with over 80 murder investigations opened since the start of 2018. Despite these worrying statistics, violence should never be tolerated, and those responsible must face consequences for their actions. Sir Christopher Meyer is a respected and accomplished advocate for British foreign affairs, who called for his country to engage with President Trump ahead of his visit. His attack highlights the need for a greater degree of civility, tolerance, and respect towards differing opinions. We must never allow violence or intimidation to become an acceptable means of expressing political dissent.",rewrite_generation

This is in relation to the FBI, Democratic National Committee (DNC), Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, who allegedly conspired together for deceptive purposes. Reports indicate that the DNC administered the Clinton Foundation to fund a fake dossier, masterminded by Christopher Steele and Fusion GPS, in an attempt to establish false allegations capable of conceding Donald Trump's Presidential victory. James Comey later obtained the dossier and issued FISA warrants to surveil Donald Trump and his associates in Trump Tower, while the Robert Mueller Special Counsel was launched to investigate any Russian collusion in the 2016 Presidential Election.

There have, however, been concerns that this episode reveals nothing but acts of spying and treason on the part of the DNC under the Obama regime. Denzel Washington himself has raised a vital point of concern stating that if the Democrats had actually won the election, the use of fake documents to obtain warrants for spying on American citizens and political opponents would have remained undiscovered. Furthermore, he suggested that the current situation presents nothing but an opportunity for the Democrats to use the same tactics in the future to circumvent the will of the people in subsequent elections.

Reports have also revealed that the warrant to probe the Trump team was based on media reports that in turn used information provided by an opposition research firm that was being paid by the DNC and Hillary Clinton. It is reasonable to question the ethical implications of this action, particularly in the absence of media scrutiny, which could have blown the whistle on the conspiracies of the DNC. It is noteworthy that media outlets are complicit in covering up the scandals of the Democratic Party.

Denzel Washington's claims are as pertinent as they are timely, given that they reflect the apparent double standards that exist in relation to this issue. A celebrity figure like Denzel Washington who is high up in leadership circles agrees that the issue has been downplayed by mainstream media, when it should have been treated with more importance and gravity, given its treasonous nature.",rewrite_generation

Mistakes like this won’t be very funny when they cost us more than a laugh.","News sites quickly reported on a tweet from a Twitter user with the handle @solikearose, who claimed to have seen CNN broadcast porn instead of the scheduled program ""Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown."" However, many of these reports were based solely on the tweets of one person, with some outlets failing to include statements from CNN or the cable company supposedly responsible for airing the content. Fact-checking did not begin until after the stories were published, and there is no evidence to suggest that the incident actually occurred. CNN has requested an explanation from the cable operator but this does not verify the alleged event. This illustrates how fake news can easily spread and emphasizes the importance of verifying information before publishing, as fake news can have serious consequences.",rewrite_generation

However, for those opting to live in tiny homes, storage space becomes a critical concern that must be factored in during the planning phase of building, buying, or furnishing their living quarters. Though it is not always feasible to downsize beyond a certain point, careful planning for storage space is essential to make tiny living a comfortable and functional reality. 

Verticality is crucial in tiny homes, especially since their floor plans are substantially smaller. Since there is limited space to put things on the floor, wall-mounted shelving can help maximize storage space without taking up any additional floor area. Additionally, such shelving solutions are budget-friendly and easy to install. If you opt for wall-mounting your television and speakers, you will free up additional space for other essential items that may be of greater priority. 

Multi-functional furniture is a must-have in tiny homes. Beds, coffee, and night tables, kitchen elements, and sofas need to serve multiple purposes, one of which is storage. Drawers can be installed beneath beds to support linen storage. Similarly, cube-design coffee tables can be used instead of regular ones, for they contain multiple drawers for storing your belongings. 

Customizable furniture is another excellent solution for tiny homes. Furnishing a tiny home can be challenging and requires ingenuity when it comes to space utilization. Custom-made furniture helps to optimize every corner and nook of your home. It can come in handy when it comes to storage, for a well-placed locker or shelf can efficiently fulfill key functions without taking up too much space. While custom-made furniture does come at a price, it is a worthwhile investment that will simplify your life in a tiny home. 

The size of furniture and appliances that fit into a tiny home is limited. Using tiny appliances is essential to maximizing available space for storage and other functional requirements. While a full-sized stove may not be practical, a dual heat-plate design is more appropriate. Similarly, a small refrigerator or a two-door model is preferable to a large one. Finally, shopping frequently for fresh groceries can lead you to embrace a healthy lifestyle and diet. Incorporating a fold-out dining table rather than a regular one can also save valuable space in the kitchen. Though tiny appliances tend to be pricier than their standard-sized counterparts, they provide benefits that outweigh their cost.",rewrite_generation

While many defend the rights of Muslims to practice their religion without fear or persecution, others remain critical of what they consider to be a real danger posed by Islam. Recent reports suggest that even in the United States, some officials are taking steps to limit free speech in a bid to protect those who may be targeted by intolerance. This is particularly evident in the city of Minneapolis, which has established an anti-hate hotline designed to help residents counteract acts of intolerance and hateful behaviour directed at specific minority groups. While some fear that this hotline will only serve to restrict free speech and hurt those with minority opinions deemed 'forbidden,' others are grateful for the city's proactive stance in protecting its people.

Why would Hodges say something like this if it weren’t true? Is it all conspiracy garbage? Let us know your thoughts!","Former CIA officer, Normand Hodges, has recently come forward with a shocking set of confessions. He has admitted to being involved in no less than 37 assassinations for the American government between 1959 and 1972 and is claiming involvement in the assassination of actress and model, Marilyn Monroe. Hodges, who is now 78-years-old, says that he carries no regrets for his actions.

Hodges was a member of a group of five CIA agents who were tasked specifically with carrying out assassinations. He was a highly trained operative with top-level security clearances, possessing expertise in martial arts and sniper tactics, as well as proficiency in using a variety of lethal methods, from poisons to explosives.

Despite his elderly age, Hodges has displayed remarkable recall, recounting each of the assassinations that he carried out on American soil. He claims that he was acting on orders from his commanding officer, Major James “Jimmy” Hayworth, between August 1959 and March 1972, when “the CIA had its own agenda”. Hodges admits that the victims of these assassinations came from all aspects of society, ranging from journalists and political activists to union leaders, artists, and scientists. The common thread that tied them all together was their perceived threat to the interests of the United States.

Most strikingly, Hodges confesses that Marilyn Monroe was the only woman he ever assassinated and an unconventional target at that. He claims that she had become a national security risk, thanks to her romantic relationships with both John F Kennedy and Fidel Castro, and that her death was necessary to prevent the transmission of sensitive information to the communists.

Hodges insists he killed Monroe upon the orders of Major Hayworth, who instructed him to stage the murder as a suicide or suicide attempt involving an overdose. Using his expertise in sedative and barbiturate injections, Hodges claims he entered Monroe’s sleeping quarters and injected her with a lethal dose of Chloral Hydrate mixed with Nembutal, causing her death.

The FBI is taking Hodges claims very seriously and has placed him under custody as they open an investigation into his allegations. Of course, with Major Hayworth already deceased and the two other identified CIA assassins also deceased, this investigation is sure to raise many questions about the nature of the CIA’s activities in America during that time period. While some may view these allegations as conspiracy garbage, there is much evidence to suggest that Hodges’ confessions deserve careful examination.",rewrite_generation

He claimed it was done as a favor to senior Iranian officials linked to President Hassan Rouhani, and he alleged the move sparked a competition among Iranian officials over whose children would benefit from the scheme.Several children of current and former Iranian officials live in the United States, including Ali Fereydoun, whose father is brother and special aide of President Hassan Rouhan, and Fatemeh Ardeshir Larijani, whose father Ali Larijani is speaker of parliament.While Zolnour did not mention any names, he obviously was trying to make a political point.“When Obama, during the negotiations about the JCPOA, decided to do a favor to these men, he granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians and some officials started a competition over whose children could be part of these 2,500 Iranians,” he claimed. “If today these Iranians get deported from America, it will become clear who is complicit and sells the national interest like he is selling candies to America.” The conservative Zolnour, who is in Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s inner circle, added: “It should be stated exactly which children of which authorities live in the United States and have received citizenship or residency.”He said while some were studying in the U.S. others were working in the U.S. “against our national interests.”It’s not clear who he’s talking about and whether he’s confusing a green card with citizenship.

A representative for Obama Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson also could not be reached for comment.This would certainly anger Republicans, especially in the wake of the pallets of cash, sanctions relief and giving access to the U.S. financial system that has already been revealed about the deal.And in Iran, they could fuel resentment toward Tehran’s elite. “Many ordinary Iranians are surprised and feel betrayed that children of the regime officials live and work in the U.S.,” Saeed Ghasseminejad, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based research institute, told Fox News. “The regime officials chant death to America but send their children to the U.S., away from the hell they have created in Iran over the past four decades.” Ghasseminejad said some Iranians have called for their deportation from America: “Iranians don’t understand why the U.S. government allows the offspring of the regime officials to live in the U.S., while the U.S. has introduced a travel ban for ordinary Iranian citizens and many Americans are imprisoned in Iran.

Upon entering the residence, officers noted a pervasive smell of decomposition. A generator was found running in the kitchen of the property which had no electricity. Thompson, exhibiting aggressive behavior, attempted to flee from police, leading law enforcement officials down into the basement of the property where they were met with a foul odor further intensified by their descent.

At the recent Third Review Conference for the UN's Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons, American representatives reportedly committed to developing legal frameworks that would ensure proper management of small arms and light weapons stockpiles, including those owned by American citizens. Furthermore, the UN's plan includes demands for a massive database of all organizations, parties, and individuals involved in the manufacture, ownership, sale, trade, or transfer of firearms or ammunition. This is alarming because given the UN's track record of pushing for gun control measures, it is possible that they may declare wide swaths of firearms illegal, or even go as far as to make home manufacture of ammunition for private use or resale illegal. The UN's Programme of Action also allows peacekeepers to go to member nations to assist in meeting the goals of the program. This may lead to a potential scenario where the UN forces the US to hand over civilian-owned firearms for destruction or even send their own personnel to enforce the demands. American citizens have the right to be concerned about this situation, and it is essential to monitor the actions of the UN on American soil closely.",rewrite_generation

politifact15123,"EspañolThe current influenza season has been especially difficult, causing widespread illness that has affected all fifty states and resulted in a record number of hospitalizations. While healthcare professionals continue to combat this year’s flu – which may continue to affect Americans into April – we’re already partnering with other public health agencies to conduct essential work to produce next season’s influenza vaccines.As part of this process, we’re striving to better understand why we saw reduced effectiveness of this year’s influenza vaccines against one strain of influenza A, called H3N2. It was this strain that caused much of the influenza-related illness this flu season. Moreover, this year is not the first time we have seen vaccines be less effective against this particular strain of influenza, H3N2.As such, we are taking a number of actions to better understand why effectiveness tends to be lower against the H3N2 strain and what we can do about it. By looking closely at the available data and applying the lessons we learn each flu season to the vaccine development process, we offer the greatest chance of developing vaccines that even more effectively prevent the flu in the future.These lessons may be applied not only to enhancing the most prevalent process for developing influenza vaccine in eggs, but to considering whether greater investment in alternative processes such as cell-based or recombinant approaches to vaccine development are required. With this statement, I want to outline what we’ve learned so far about this season’s vaccines and the steps we’re taking and plan to take to determine the root cause of this year’s findings and better prepare for future flu seasons.Reduced effectiveness of 2017-2018 seasonal vaccines against H3N2There are a number of theories on why this season’s vaccines produced reduced effectiveness against H3N2. We’re taking steps to investigate each of these potential causes, rule out possible reasons for the variation in effectiveness and improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Overall, preliminary vaccine effectiveness reported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for H3N2 influenza was 25 percent, which means that people who received the vaccine were 25 percent less likely to be sick and need to see a doctor.While that finding isn’t too far off from the vaccine effectiveness seen against H3N2 in previous years, we need to take new steps to improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Of note, the effectiveness of the vaccine against H3N2 in children 6 months to 8 years of age was 51 percent this season, yet the effectiveness in those 65 years and older was only 17 percent, and the effectiveness in older children and adults under 65 years of age was even lower. The vaccines did do much better for other viruses that are also causing the flu this season. The data show that overall vaccine effectiveness for H1N1 and influenza B was 67 percent and 42 percent, respectively, for all age groups combined.So why did this season’s vaccines not deliver higher protection against H3N2? And why have vaccines in prior seasons when H3N2 circulated, also delivered reduced protection against this particular flu strain?We don’t think it was a question of getting the particular H3N2 strain wrong when we set out to produce this season’s flu vaccines. Although adapting circulating virus strains for manufacture can lead to differences between the circulating strain and the one used for manufacturing that could affect effectiveness, so far the data we have suggests that the viruses provided by reference laboratories to manufacturers to make this year’s vaccines do reasonably match the circulating flu strains that are causing most of the illnesses, including H3N2.However, we’re working with our colleagues at CDC and other federal agencies to examine and address other factors that might be contributing to the less than optimal overall protection provided by this season’s vaccines against influenz",1,en,"EspañolThe current influenza season has been especially difficult, causing widespread illness that has affected all fifty states and resulted in a record number of hospitalizations.

We would particularly like to understand why vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 influenza year-to-year tends to be lower than effectiveness against other influenza viruses.Working to determine the root causesToward these ends, scientists at FDA are collaborating with colleagues at Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to use a large database that includes details of the flu vaccines administered to four million individuals along with whether they were hospitalized for influenza or treated with antiviral medications for influenza-like illness. This work, which is still underway, will try to better understand why overall effectiveness with both the cell-based and egg-based vaccines was less than optimal. We’re also looking at the difference in effectiveness in people 65 years and older who were vaccinated with high-dose influenza vaccine and adjuvanted influenza vaccine to see if effectiveness was better than in those vaccinated with standard dose vaccines. The adjuvanted influenza vaccine contains an ingredient meant to boost the immune system’s response to the vaccine while high dose vaccines contain four times as much of the influenza material or antigen as standard vaccines. What we learn about the differences in efficacy between these different vaccines might reveal information that can inform why overall effectiveness against H3N2 was lagging.What might this information reveal? One theory is that people might require a higher amount of H3N2 antigen to elicit a proper immune response to that particular strain of influenza. As I noted previously, the work conducted with CMS shows a preliminary finding that suggests the cell-based influenza vaccine might be somewhat more effective than the egg-based vaccine. We are working to follow up on that finding. We’re also combing through the data to see if there are other reasons for why this season’s vaccines were less effective against H3N2. Our scientists are currently working internally and collaborating with others inside and outside of the federal government to understand all of these findings.The knowledge we gain through such scientific research will allow us to determine if we need to change recommendations to vaccine manufacturers for how future season’s vaccines should be produced.Looking ahead to the 2018-2019 flu seasonWhile this scientific work is underway, the composition of next season’s flu vaccines will be the subject of an FDA advisory committee","The current influenza season has been particularly challenging, affecting people in all fifty states and causing record numbers of hospitalizations. Although healthcare professionals are continuing to tackle the current flu, work is already underway with public health agencies to create next season’s influenza vaccines.

Efforts are focused on understanding why this year’s vaccines had reduced effectiveness against H3N2, a virus strain that caused a significant amount of the flu-related illness this season. Notably, this is not the first time that a vaccine has had a lower effectiveness rate against H3N2.

To address this issue, we are actively taking steps to investigate why these vaccines have had lower efficacy rates and what we can do to improve them. By closely evaluating the available data, we can apply the lessons learned from each flu season to improve the vaccine development process.

These lessons may be applied not only to enhance the egg-based process used for developing the influenza vaccine, but also to explore whether alternative approaches such as cell-based or recombinant methods have greater potential.

To date, preliminary CDC vaccine effectiveness figures indicate that the rate of protection against H3N2 was only 25 percent. While this is not too dissimilar to previous years, it is evident that we must take new steps to improve the vaccine effectiveness, particularly in older people for whom this year’s vaccines had a much lower efficacy rate.

Why did this year’s vaccines exhibit lower efficacy? Although we don’t believe it was a question of selecting the wrong H3N2 strain for this year's vaccines, we are working closely with CDC and other public health bodies to determine the root cause of the reduced effectiveness and how we can continue to prepare for future flu seasons.

One of the theories we are investigating is whether higher quantities of H3N2 antigen are required to elicit the desired immune response for this particular strain of influenza. Other factors may also be involved, and we are collaborating with a range of external partners to gain a comprehensive understanding of the issue.

As we work to understand the root causes of this year’s findings, we will continue to refine our recommendations to vaccine manufacturers, paving the way for a more successful 2018-2019 flu season. An FDA advisory committee will also be convened to discuss the composition of next season’s flu vaccines.",rewrite_generation

Several months later, the newspaper reported that young immigrants, including children, were being placed into internment camps as part of a program to remove them from the trafficking cycle operated by drug cartels. Human rights organizations, as well as Mexican officials, expressed their concerns regarding this program, which was called the Juvenile Referral Process.

The program was initiated by Robert Harris, who was the Commander of the Laredo sector of U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the time. His intelligence analysts had detected that a significant number of the individuals assisting with the smuggling of other migrants were Mexican children under the age of 18. Cartels would either hire or conscript teenagers to work for them, knowing that they could get away with it since these children would not be prosecuted if caught. Harris believed that removing young Mexicans working for cartels from the smuggling enterprise was the solution to this loophole.

Consequently, young Mexicans, being held without charge, are now being detained in shelters across the United States for months, sometimes without their parent's knowledge, after being apprehended by border agents. Since May, 536 juveniles have been held, and 248 individuals have been deported back to Mexico after a stay averaging 75 days, according to statistics from the Border Patrol. Mexican authorities claim that some of these repeat border-crossers have spent up to six months in U.S. custody awaiting an appearance before an immigration judge. During their detention, they are questioned by U.S. authorities before being transferred to a network of facilities run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement across 15 different states.

In contrast to Donald Trump's policy of separating children from their parents to prevent them from being incarcerated together, Barack Obama's strategy sought to gather information from young illegal immigrants about drug cartels. However, this program stirred up several concerns, with experts stating that the purpose of this program was to interrogate the children. While in detention, these kids were often questioned about the criminal organizations they worked for and were subsequently returned to Mexico without any apparent concern about the implications for them.

Maureen Meyer, an expert on Mexico and migrants at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), stressed that ""Our concern is that the program's real intent is to interrogate the kids."" The interrogation focused on the criminal groups that the children were working for and then returned to Mexico without any apparent concern about the implications. Mexican children who provided information about certain criminal organizations they were working for were punished for their cooperation by group members. This was seen in the case of a young Mexican boy who was placed in hiding after returning to Mexico. U.S. authorities were not tracking the children after they were returned to Mexico.

While the program appears to be effective as it informs only 7% of children that go through the program have been caught illegally crossing the border again, questions raise. The Mexican government's office for the protection of Mexicans abroad was taken by surprise when the program was initiated. Reyna Torres Mendivil states ""The moment it started, it took us all by surprise, because there wasn't an announcement. Where were they taking these children?""",rewrite_generation

I am not certain where he is now, but in 2016, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children.”Mr. Snowden says the CIA orchestrated the fake death of the former leader of Al Qaeda, while he was actually transported with his family to an undisclosed location in the Bahamas.“Osama Bin Laden was one of the CIA’s most efficient operatives for a long time,” claims the famous whistleblower. “What kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobody’s looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him.”Mr. Snowden says that the documents proving that Bin Laden is still alive will be integrally reproduced in his new book, expected to be released in September.Edward Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor in 2013 after previous employment with Dell and the CIA. In the month of June of the same year, he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists.The US government filed espionage charges against him shortly after his revelations were made public. He has been living under asylum in Moscow, after fleeing the US for Hong Kong in the wake of the leaks.On July 28, 2015, the White House has rejected a “We the People” petition of nearly 168,000 signatories, to pardon him.",1,en,"Moscow | National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden has made a new controversial claim yesterday, saying that he possessed some classified information proving that Osama Bin Laden is still alive.Snowden, who lives as a fugitive in Russia after leaking documents about the NSA’s surveillance programs has made some previously unreported allegations about the famous terrorist, Osama Bin Laden, during an interview with the Moscow Tribune.According to him, not only is Bin Laden still alive, but he is living a lavish lifestyle in the Bahamas, thanks to regular payments from the CIA.“I have documents showing that Bin Laden is still on the CIA’s payroll,” claims Edward Snowden. “He is still receiving more than $100,000 a month, which are being transferred through some front businesses and organizations, directly to his Nassau bank account.

Snowden, currently residing in Russia, revealed the classified information during an interview with the Moscow Tribune. According to Snowden, Bin Laden is living a comfortable life in the Bahamas, courtesy of regular six-figure payments from the CIA. In his claim, Snowden notes that the former Al Qaeda leader was one of the CIA’s most successful operatives before being given a false death in 2011. Snowden asserts that Bin Laden was transported to an undisclosed location in the Bahamas, where he currently resides with his family. Snowden’s revelation is set to be further detailed in his upcoming book, slated to be released next month. It is important to note that Snowden made similar allegations in 2014 in an interview with a German newspaper, although at that time, his claims were met with skepticism from the intelligence community. Regardless, Snowden’s previous actions firmly cement his credibility as a whistleblower and will undoubtedly make his new claim a topic of interest for many.",rewrite_generation

While Fox News has seen an increase of 6 percent in total viewers, CNN's numbers have plummeted, raising concerns about the network's future.

politifact13942,"The government has implemented a new regulation requiring a governor to be placed on all motorcycles by mid-January 2017. The purpose of the mandatory governor would be to prevent motorcyclists from exceeding a speed of 75- miles per hour. The regulation aims to drastically reduce the amount of annual motorcycle fatalities in the United States.Many are not surprised by the regulation as politicians have been asking for stricter safety features to be implemented on motorcycles for the past several decades. In 2014, the government offered all major motorcycle manufactures including Harley-Davidson, Yamaha, Honda, Ducati, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and BMW a large tax-incentive to begin implementing governors on all newly manufactured motorcycles, however to much surprise, all relevant manufactures declined to take advantage of the additional tax-incentive, requiring government officials to return to the drawing board.Members of the U.S. Department of Transportation or U.D.O.T were supportive of the regulation and heavily involved in its roll-out. According to U.S. Department of Transportation representative James Littleton, the motorcycle governor regulation was long past due and made a comparison to the governors placed on traditional automobiles. Littleton told reporters during a press-conference that each year approximately 8,265 motorcycle fatalities occur throughout the United States. According to Littleton, the vast majority (approximately 73%) of motorcycle fatalities are the result of motorcyclists driving at unsafe speeds.When asked why the regulation would only allow motorcyclists to maintain a speed below 75-miles per hour, Littleton made the following comment to reporters, “This is a crucial safety regulation that should have been implemented at least 20-years ago, now that we are finally implementing it, we want to ensure we do it right. With the exception of a few states that allow for 80-miles per mile freeway driving (Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) and Texas who allows for speeds of up to 85-miles per hour on the freeway, most states allow a maximum speed of 75-miles per hour. We wanted to make it easy for motorcyclists in most all states to easily obey their respective posted speed limit.”According to Littleton, motorcyclists in the few states that periodically allow for speeds exceeding 75-miles per hour, governors allowing speeds up to 80-85-miles per hour may eventually be implemented, however in the meantime, police officials in these states have been given direction to avoid citing motorcyclists for such infractions as obstructing the flow of traffic when relevant.Officials expect all motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures to be in compliance with the new regulation by mid to late January 2017, however may file for a temporary 30, 60, or 90-day extension under select circumstances. According to Littleton, citations and fines will be imposed on both motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures who fail to remain in compliance with the regulation.According to Littleton, designated motorcycle mechanic and auto-body shops in each state will be permitted to install the mandatory governors on motorcycles manufactured and sold prior to the implementation of the regulation at a subsidized rate. Littleton did not have details regarding the government subsidized repair readily available, however told reporters that he expects the subsidized cost to be around $35 to the consumer.Littleton concluded the press conference by informing reporters that the U.S Department of Transportation is currently working diligently to release all relevant information pertaining to the new regulation on the U.D.O.T website.",1,en,"The government has implemented a new regulation requiring a governor to be placed on all motorcycles by mid-January 2017.

The purpose of this regulation is to enforce a speed limit of 75-miles per hour on motorcyclists, with the ultimate goal of significantly reducing the number annual motorcycle fatalities in the United States. There has been a long-standing appeal from politicians for the implementation of stricter safety measures on motorcycles, and the US government offered tax incentives to major manufacturers to begin incorporating governors into their motorcycles in 2014. Unfortunately, none of these manufacturers, which included Harley-Davidson, Yamaha, Honda, Ducati, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and BMW, chose to take advantage of these incentives, sending the government back to the drawing board. 

The US Department of Transportation (U.D.O.T) is heavily involved in the new regulation, with representative James Littleton leading the charge. Littleton explained that governors are long overdue on motorcycles, and compared it to the governors placed on traditional cars. According to Littleton, motorcycle fatalities account for approximately 8,265 deaths each year in the United States, with the vast majority (around 73%) being attributed to unsafe speeds. 

When asked about the speed limit of 75-miles per hour, Littleton clarified that it is designed to correspond with the maximum speed limit of most states. States that permit higher speeds, such as Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming, and Texas, which allows for speeds up to 85-miles per hour, may eventually be allowed to have governors that permit higher speeds. Until then, police in these states have been advised not to issue citations for exceeding speed limits. 

The new regulation is expected to be complied with by mid to late January 2017, with temporary extensions of up to 90 days granted in select circumstances. Littleton warned that failure to comply with the new regulation may result in citations and fines for both riders and manufacturers. To ease the implementation, designated motorcycle mechanic and auto-body shops will be subsidized to install governors on motorcycles that were sold before the regulation’s implementation, with the cost to the consumer expected to be around $35.

The U.D.O.T is currently working on releasing all the pertinent information regarding the new regulation on its official website, with Littleton assuring the public that the website will be updated as soon as possible.",rewrite_generation

The couple who perished in the explosion, John Paladino and Carole Paladino, were longtime residents of the area. However, there have been unsubstantiated claims linking Carole Paladino's potential testimony against the Clinton Foundation to the explosion. The expected testimony concerned a pharmaceutical company that had donated to the Clinton Foundation, allegedly in an effort to cover up their drug price gouging crimes. This claim is part of a larger narrative that suggests there is a ""Clinton body count"". It should be noted that there is no factual basis for such claims and they should be viewed as unfounded conspiracy theories. Regardless, this tragedy has brought attention to the important issue of medical scams in the US, such as EpiPen price gouging, and the devastating impact of the opioid crisis.",rewrite_generation

Following this, it was reported that nearly 900 voters who were 112 years of age had cast their ballots. This has raised suspicions among some members of the public who question the legitimacy of these votes. However, the North Carolina State Board of Elections assures us that there is no sign of voter fraud at play. The crux of the matter lies in a much more mundane explanation. Prior to the enactment of the National Voter Registration Act in 1993, the state did not require voters to provide their date of birth upon registering. While most voters did provide such information, some failed to do so. As such, these individuals were then assigned the default birth date of 01/01/1900 on the state's voter rolls.

This liberal billionaire has used his massive wealth and resources to essentially control the Democratic Party. Which is why if Hillary Clinton had won the presidential election, she would have been listening to Soros.When you’re done imaging that nightmare scenario, it’s important to realize that the fight isn’t over yet. Hillary might have lost the election, but Soros is still out there, mobilizing and planning more moves that seek to dismantle the Donald Trump presidency.That’s why Trump finally had enough and is going to charge Soros as a “threat to national security” in the United States. Considering that this is the same man that has mobilized and paid protesters to create a tremendous amount of damage, it’s been a long time coming for this order.Trump had placed a call to Russia to ask about “any and all” files that are related to Soros. He was able to do this thanks to the 2014 Executive Order that was signed by President Obama, entitled “Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine.”“I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that the actions and policies of persons that undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.”Nearly a month after this order was signed US diplomatic cables show that Soros did “undermine the processes and institutions in Ukraine.” Due to Soros’s illegal intervention into a peaceful transition of power, mass conflict erupted and an estimated 9,600 men, women, and children lost their lives.Clearly that is interfering in the process. So why didn’t President Obama charge Soros as a threat to the United States national security? It’s because Soros flooded Obama and Hillary’s Democratic Party with about $100 million in donations. You really think that Obama is going to charge someone that has donated that much to their party?Soros began his takeover back in 2004, as he declared “it is the central focus of my life” and “a matter of life and death” to push his influence on the American people and our democracy. While 2004 failed, Soros had turned to 2016 and had become Hillary’s highest donor. We know that Hillary listens to people that donate to her, so she would have been listening to Soros the entire time.Now that the Democratic Party has been completely defeated, Soros is doing what he can to go against President Trump, saying “democracy is now in crisis.” Soros has been active in his fight against Trump, as he was discovered to have been the mastermind behind paying protesters to cause as much damage and destruction as possible.During the election season, there were several Black Lives Matter protests that quickly turned violent.

This man has been responsible for fund","It is widely known and heavily discussed that George Soros, a wealthy supporter of liberal causes, is disliked by many individuals around the world. He has used his extensive resources to exert significant control over the Democratic Party, causing alarm about his influence on political decisions if Hillary Clinton had in fact been elected president. Although the election results did not turn out that way, the prospect of Soros's continued influence on the US political system is concerning. As such, President Trump has announced that he plans to charge Soros as a ""threat to national security"" within the United States. This move was possible thanks to an Executive Order signed by former president Obama in 2014, which identified individuals who were contributing to the situation in Ukraine and undermining democratic processes within that country. Diplomatic cables suggest that Soros had contravened these particular rules, contributing to the turmoil that took place in Ukraine in 2014 and leading to the deaths of thousands.

The question then becomes: why didn't Obama take action against Soros at the time? It appears that the billionaire has donated a significant amount to the Democratic party over the years, making it unlikely that the former president would pursue charges against him. The extent of Soros's influence over the Democratic Party is astounding, with the billionaire declaring back in 2004 that it was the central focus of his life to push his influence on the American people and their democracy. Funding from Soros has been linked to protests, some of which turned violent, occurring during both the Black Lives Matter and 2016 presidential election protests. Soros's efforts to disrupt the Trump presidency have been ongoing, with the billionaire rallying against what he sees as a democracy in crisis.

Given the tumultuous nature of the current political climate, it is perhaps for the best that Soros faces consequences for his actions. Donald Trump's decision to pursue charges against Soros will no doubt have many individuals feeling a sense of relief that someone is finally taking action against such a powerful and influential individual, who has been responsible for financial support of impactful, destructive protests around the country.",rewrite_generation

Bodies flew. People were terrified and screaming. Those closest to it said it was definitely a violent attack. The driver, who people later described as a skinny white guy with a straggly beard, reversed out of there and drove off, the front end of his car all smashed up.”Charlottesville mayor Mike Signer tweeted: “I am heartbroken that a life has been lost here. I urge all people of good will – go home.”Speaking at a press conference on Saturday evening, the governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, who had earlier declared a state of emergency, told the white supremacists: “Go home … Shame on you. You pretend you are patriots, but you are anything but a patriot.”The mother of Fields told the Associated Press on Saturday night that she knew her son was attending a rally in Virginia but didn’t know it was a white supremacist rally.“I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump’s not a white supremacist,” Samantha Bloom said, before becoming visibly upset as she learned of the injuries and deaths at the rally “He had an African-American friend …,” she said before her voice trailed off.Responding to the events in Charlottesville from Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump: “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides.”But the Republican senator Marco Rubio tweeted that it was important for Trump to describe the events as a “terror attack by white supremacists”.The FBI said it was opening a civil rights investigation into the accident along with the justice department’s civil rights division and the district attorney’s office.The US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, said: “The violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice. When such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred, they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated.NBC News (@NBCNews) WATCH: White nationalists and counter-protesters clash at Charlottesville rally https://t.co/4qH1yJjrGyThe car attack came about two hours after state police in riot gear had cleared Emancipation Park, the site of the Robert E Lee statue. The city’s decision in February to remove the statue drew earlier protests by the “alt-right” and the Ku Klux Klan.Riot police cleared the park after almost an hour of clashes. The far-right groups were largely compliant, but had to run the gauntlet of counter-protesters as they walked west along Market Street.After a brief stalemate, a hard core of about 100 far-right protesters moved to a park two miles away and gathered to hear speakers who had been scheduled for the “Unite the Right” event.One of the speakers, the far-right figurehead Richard Spencer, said he had been maced on the way in and lashed out at police and city authorities.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Rescue personnel help injured people after a car ran into a large group. Photograph: Steve Helber/AP“Never in my life have I felt like the government was cracking down on me until today,” said Spencer. “We came in peace and we were effectively thrown to the wolves.”He said that they would not back down from protesting against the statue. When he mentioned Mayor Signer by name, the crowd chanted: “Jew! Jew! Jew!”Around the park, members of the far right were nursing and treating minor wounds. One of them, who declined to give his name, was bleeding from the head, and claimed to have been struck with an iron bar. Another young man, with a swastika tattoo on his chest and blood on his forehead, told photographers: “If you take my picture, I’ll cut you. I’m not even kidding.”Meanwhile, counter-protesters were trying to stop the far-right groups from entering the park. Some counter-protesters, including many marching under red and black anti-fascist banners, tried to block the streets. This led to altercations with far-right groups, who were seen using chemical weapons, sticks and shields on people.A group of clergy linked arms to block a set of stairs leading into the park. The Rev Seth Wispelwey, of Sojourners United Church of Christ in Charlottesville, said:","A 32-year-old woman from Charlottesville, Virginia has died and 19 have been injured after a car rammed into a group of people protesting against a white supremacist rally. On Saturday afternoon, a young man was arrested and charged with murder following the attack that took place at Charlottesville, Virginia. James Fields, aged 20 and from Ohio, was charged with second degree murder along with three counts of malicious wounding and failing to stop at an accident resulting in a death. While President Trump condemned the “violence on many sides,” he came under widespread criticism for his failure to denounce the far-right demonstrators. In a separate and tragic incident, two police officers who were monitoring the Far-Right rally died when their helicopter crashed, outside Charlottesville. The day was marked by scenes of violence and clashes between Far-Right nationalists and those who had come out to protest against them in a downtown park. The car plowed into innocent protestors at a peaceful rally against white supremacists. Witnesses say that the driver, a skinny white man with a straggly beard who has been identified as James Fields, reversed and drove away from the scene. In response to the tragedy, an investigation has begun by the FBI, the justice department’s civil rights division and the district attorney’s office. US Attorney General Jeff Sessions condemned the violence and reiterated that it was an unacceptable act of racial bigotry and hatred that betrayed American law and justice.",rewrite_generation

Here in America, we do not pay obeisance to the powerful – in fact, we question the powerful most ardently – to do so is our birthright and a requirement of our citizenship -- and so, we know well that no matter how powerful, no president will ever have dominion over objective reality.No politician will ever get to tell us what the truth is and is not. And anyone who presumes to try to attack or manipulate the truth to his own purposes should be made to realize the mistake and be held to account. That is our job here.

Politicians don’t.No longer can we compound attacks on truth with our silent acquiescence. No longer can we turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to these assaults on our institutions. And Mr. President, an American president who cannot take criticism – who must constantly deflect and distort and distract – who must find someone else to blame -- is charting a very dangerous path. And a Congress that fails to act as a check on the president adds to the danger.Now, we are told via twitter that today the president intends to announce his choice for the “most corrupt and dishonest” media awards. It beggars belief that an American president would engage in such a spectacle. But here we are.And so, 2018 must be the year in which the truth takes a stand against power that would weaken it. In this effort, the choice is quite simple. And in this effort, the truth needs as many allies as possible. Together, my colleagues, we are powerful.

According to him, the year 2017 was particularly challenging, as truth was threatened by powerful political figures, the most notable of whom was POTUS. The phrase ""alternative facts"" was introduced into the American lexicon, replacing the age-old concept of falsehoods. Additionally, freedom of speech was attacked by the president himself, who vehemently proclaimed through Twitter that any media that didn't suit him was lying. Senator Flake believes that attacks on truth will have long-lasting effects, and that the president's reign over objective reality is, in reality, short-lived. As politicians don't usually correct their mistakes as the free press does, it's up to lawmakers to act as the guardians of the truth. Senator Flake concludes by calling on his colleagues to unite in defense of the truth and democracy itself.",rewrite_generation

This surprising development follows several years of sustained propaganda that has resulted in Australian citizens voluntarily undergoing the controversial procedure. Shanti Korporaal, a resident of Sydney, has gained widespread attention due to her decision to surgically implant microchips in both of her hands. She asserts that she has no regrets about her choice and even encourages others to follow in her footsteps. The chips are fitted with a unique identifier that enables users to access locked doors, transmit personal information to devices, and connect to bank details. Ms. Korporaal argues that such technology can relieve individuals of the burden of managing countless passwords and PINs. Another anonymous individual who also underwent the procedure claimed that convenience drove their decision. While this may provide temporary benefits, the long-term implications of having microchips implanted in one's body are alarming. Modern technology permits government and law enforcement agencies to access the personal details of everyday citizens to a degree that was previously impossible. For example, numerous reports suggest that American law enforcement agencies frequently track cell phones without a warrant. Additionally, Edward Snowden revealed that the government maintains a vast amount of information on every individual, irrespective of whether they are under suspicion or not. This trend of microchipping therefore raises concerns among civil liberties advocates, who fear that the technology will permit the government to have an unbreakable record of a person's every move and transaction. The only way to remove a surgically implanted microchip is through another painful procedure. Therefore, advocates are bewildered by the willingness of private citizens to waive their rights to privacy and security through such an invasive approach.",rewrite_generation
