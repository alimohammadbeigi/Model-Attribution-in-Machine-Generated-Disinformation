Come on, I’m not buying it.”“Like, I can understand about the Second Amendment and maybe something else that happened way, way back, but the King being dead? I really don’t know who would believe that. Just last night I saw him on YouTube. You know YouTube? He was performing in Vegas and there were thousands of bearded and longhaired men in the audience, so it must have been a beard convention or something. I swear, sometimes I don’t believe how stupid Americans can be,” she said.","Gretchen Carlson is urging for a ban on AR-15s, stating that they are not necessary for hunting or killing deer. She believes they only assist terrorists in their attacks. She cited a December 2015 poll that showed majority support for an ""assault weapons"" ban and expressed her solidarity with the majority. When Second Amendment supporters challenged her on Twitter, she stood by her pro-ban stance, stating that they were using the Second Amendment argument out of ignorance.

Thanks to Medicaid he’s being treated for cancer. During the CNN town hall with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Kline explained his situation and his struggles. “My question is pretty straightforward,” Kline told Price. “Why do you want to take away my Medicaid expansion?” Price’s dispassionate answer seemed to fall flat on the audience. “I took care of a lot of patients with cancer,” Price explained about his 20 years as an orthopedic surgeon. “We don’t want to take care away from anybody. What we want to make certain, though, is that every single American has access to the kind of coverage and care that they want for themselves.”“But, what if there are people out there who are going to die more quickly because of what you’re doing here, because you’re essentially taking medical care away from people who need it the most?” Kline wouldn’t back down. “Are you saying you actually want people to be okay with that?” Price thought for a second, then replied: “Look, I understand how all of this sounds right now, but you know, there comes a time in everyone’s life when they just have to stop talking B.S. and be practical. As of right now, the fact to the matter is, our national budget is hemorrhaging money because of Obamacare. And believe me – I get how insensitive that sounds, but at the end of the day, we have to stop ignoring the facts here.”He continued, “I understand that this is not something anyone wants to hear, especially people who’ve got worse problems to deal with than the state of the national budget, but this is one of those situations where the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. When President Trump assumed office, he was appalled at the state of the national budget and our finances. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that Barack Obama was to blame, since he’s the one who left the hot potato behind for us to deal with. Now, I’m not going to go into whether or not he did that on purpose, but at the end of the day, all I can say is, we have to fix the problem or else we’re looking at nationwide riots and another economic recession.”“Put simply, we have to plug some holes – of which, by the way, there are plenty – and we kind of have to start with the biggest ones,” the orthopedic surgeon added. “Unfortunately for millions of people across the country, Obamacare seems to be the biggest one by far. Besides, there are more ways than one to look at this picture. I know it’s not pretty, but at the end of the day, even people who are able to fight off cancer – I’m sure you know what I’m talking about, Brian – they can’t lead 100 percent normal lives, ever again.

And nobody wants to be in debt to the Chinese.

politifact15031,"Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).The latest USDA data show that the number of participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the government program that administers food stamps, dropped from 45,666,795 in October 2017 to 41,658,868 in November 2017 — a staggering decrease of 4,007,927 over one month.Even though there was a temporary spike in enrollment, mostly concentrated in a few states that caused the national average of food stamp enrollment to spike, nationwide enrollment in the program as a whole is still on a steady decline.Enrollment in the program sharply increased by 3.5 million during the first month of fiscal year (FY) 2018 (October 2017) mostly due to heavy increases in temporary SNAP enrollment in hurricane-affected states such as Florida and Texas.In Florida alone, food stamp participation soared by 2.5 million from September to October due to the state administering Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) benefits to poor residents affected by Hurricane Irma.The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service approved Florida’s request to administer these special D-SNAP benefits beginning September 10, 2017.A spokesperson for Florida’s Department of Children and Families (DCF) — the program that administers food stamp benefits in Florida — confirmed with Breitbart News that the dramatic increase in SNAP enrollment in the state was due to disaster relief, but that most food stamp recipients were not normal beneficiaries of the food stamp program.“The dramatic increase in SNAP recipients in the fall was related to the state’s administration of the federal disaster SNAP program following the impact of Hurricane Irma. To qualify for the federal disaster food assistance program, individuals must have lived or worked in one of the 48 declared counties on September 5, and NOT be a customer in the regular food assistance program,” said DCF Communications Director Jessica Sims.Sims added that DCF handed out D-SNAP benefits totaling more than $1 billion to 3.1 million people in the months following Hurricane Irma, but the state curtailed its D-SNAP benefit program on December 3.The sharp decline in food stamp enrollment over one month reflects how states like Florida have curtailed their temporary food stamp benefit programs for those affected by natural disasters.But it also highlights an ongoing downward trend in food stamp enrollment that has been going on for several years since state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to get people back into the workforce.The Trump administration announced that it would adopt some of these state welfare reform measures — such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a certain number of hours per week — and implement them at the federal level, causing nationwide food stamp enrollment to plunge even further.Over the past year since President Donald Trump took office, enrollment in SNAP dropped by two million.

The temporary hike in enrollment came from only a few states and caused a spike in national food stamp enrollment. However, the overall enrollment continues its steady decline across the country.

politifact15280,"A leaked Hillary Clinton email confirms that the Obama administration, with Hillary at the helm, orchestrated a civil war in Syria to benefit Israel.The new Wikileaks release shows the then Secretary of State ordering a war in Syria in order to overthrow the government and oust President Assad, claiming it was the “best way to help Israel”.Newobserveronline.com reports:The document was one of many unclassified by the US Department of State under case number F-2014-20439, Doc No. C05794498, following the uproar over Clinton’s private email server kept at her house while she served as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013.Although the Wikileaks transcript dates the email as December 31, 2000, this is an error on their part, as the contents of the email (in particular the reference to May 2012 talks between Iran and the west over its nuclear program in Istanbul) show that the email was in fact sent on December 31, 2012.The email makes it clear that it has been US policy from the very beginning to violently overthrow the Syrian government—and specifically to do this because it is in Israel’s interests.“The best way to help Israel deal with Iran’s growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad,” Clinton forthrightly starts off by saying.Even though all US intelligence reports had long dismissed Iran’s “atom bomb” program as a hoax (a conclusion supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency), Clinton continues to use these lies to “justify” destroying Syria in the name of Israel.She specifically links Iran’s mythical atom bomb program to Syria because, she says, Iran’s “atom bomb” program threatens Israel’s “monopoly” on nuclear weapons in the Middle East.If Iran were to acquire a nuclear weapon, Clinton asserts, this would allow Syria (and other “adversaries of Israel” such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt) to “go nuclear as well,” all of which would threaten Israel’s interests.Therefore, Clinton, says, Syria has to be destroyed.Iran’s nuclear program and Syria’s civil war may seem unconnected, but they are. What Israeli military leaders really worry about — but cannot talk about — is losing their nuclear monopoly.An Iranian nuclear weapons capability would not only end that nuclear monopoly but could also prompt other adversaries, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to go nuclear as well. The result would be a precarious nuclear balance in which Israel could not respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on Syria and Lebanon, as it can today.If Iran were to reach the threshold of a nuclear weapons state, Tehran would find it much easier to call on its allies in Syria and Hezbollah to strike Israel, knowing that its nuclear weapons would serve as a deterrent to Israel responding against Iran itself.It is, Clinton continues, the “strategic relationship between Iran and the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria” that makes it possible for Iran to undermine Israel’s security.This would not come about through a “direct attack,” Clinton admits, because “in the thirty years of hostility between Iran and Israel” this has never occurred, but through its alleged “proxies.”The end of the Assad regime would end this dangerous alliance. Israel’s leadership understands well why defeating Assad is now in its interests.Bringing down Assad would not only be a massive boon to Israel’s security, it would also ease Israel’s understandable fear of losing its nuclear monopoly.Then, Israel and the United States might be able to develop a common view of when the Iranian program is so dangerous that military action could be warranted.Clinton goes on to asset that directly threatening Bashar Assad “and his family” with violence is the “right thing” to do:In short, the White House can ease the tension that has developed with Israel over Iran by doing the right thing in Syria.With his life and his family at risk, only the threat or use of force will change the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad’s mind.The email prov",1,en,"A leaked Hillary Clinton email confirms that the Obama administration, with Hillary at the helm, orchestrated a civil war in Syria to benefit Israel.The new Wikileaks release shows the then Secretary of State ordering a war in Syria in order to overthrow the government and oust President Assad, claiming it was the “best way to help Israel”.Newobserveronline.com reports:The document was one of many unclassified by the US Department of State under case number F-2014-20439, Doc No. C05794498, following the uproar over Clinton’s private email server kept at her house while she served as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013.Although the Wikileaks transcript dates the email as December 31, 2000, this is an error on their part, as the contents of the email (in particular the reference to May 2012 talks between Iran and the west over its nuclear program in Istanbul) show that the email was in fact sent on December 31, 2012.The email makes it clear that it has been US policy from the very beginning to violently overthrow the Syrian government—and specifically to do this because it is in Israel’s interests.“The best way to help Israel deal with Iran’s growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad,” Clinton forthrightly starts off by saying.Even though all US intelligence reports had long dismissed Iran’s “atom bomb” program as a hoax (a conclusion supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency), Clinton continues to use these lies to “justify” destroying Syria in the name of Israel.She specifically links Iran’s mythical atom bomb program to Syria because, she says, Iran’s “atom bomb” program threatens Israel’s “monopoly” on nuclear weapons in the Middle East.If Iran were to acquire a nuclear weapon, Clinton asserts, this would allow Syria (and other “adversaries of Israel” such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt) to “go nuclear as well,” all of which would threaten Israel’s interests.Therefore, Clinton, says, Syria has to be destroyed.Iran’s nuclear program and Syria’s civil war may seem unconnected, but they are.

It should come as no surprise that Obama chose to leave the country right now, however, as the heat was just turned up on his deep state after the firing of now former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.In the wake of this firing, it was confirmed that Obama left behind a trail of damning evidence inside the Oval Office.

Following the murder of a reporter for The Washington Examiner and the submission of a letter to his editor on his behalf, an investigation into Vince Foster's death was initiated. Foster, a Clinton attorney, had allegedly committed suicide in 1993. Rep. Trey Gowdy supported by new evidence has convinced a federal judge to exhume Foster's body for autopsy, which wasn't done before burial. A team of forensic experts in a Virginia hospital has now declared Foster's death a homicide as he had two fatal gunshot wounds in the back of his head, indicating that he couldn't have pulled the trigger himself. Unfortunately, the doctor who signed the death certificate passed away in a car crash and the police detectives who worked on the case vanished.

And to top it all off – we’ve just had the presidential election and the least favorite guy won. Now I gotta deal with that as well.”source site Asked to elaborate on her opinion on President-elect Donald Trump, Gaga said that he wasn’t her “first choice,” as well as that “he couldn’t have picked a worse time to become President of the United States,” due to the fact that “I might have to go back to hiding my face again until he gets kicked out of the White House.” “It was fun pretending to be someone else at the beginning of my career, wearing masks and all that, but there comes a time when you outgrow all those childish costumes and just want to be yourself. And I haven’t been able to do that in a long time,” she revealed.get link “So, I’m sorry to have to disappoint my fans, but I’m afraid I’m going to have to revert to wearing a mask whenever I’m out in public, and that includes performing during live shows and on television as well,” the singer revealed. “At this point I’m not sure whether that’s going to be some aggressive type of makeup or a full-on mask that’ll cover my face, but what I do know is that’s the only thing I could think of to get at least some semblance of my privacy back other than visiting a plastic surgeon. I’m too good looking to be changing my face at this age.”ikili opsiyon egitim “Until Donald Trump is fired from office and stops making everybody’s life miserable, and simultaneously, until things quiet down around me a bit to a point where I’m able to go out to lunch and not have my picture taken 10,000 times on the way to the diner, I’ll be going back to wearing a mask. What can I say – I guess I’ll need to put on an actual poker face for the time being, until things get back to normal, both in my private life and in the White House,” Gaga concluded.","Lady Gaga spoke about the challenges of fame in an interview with CBS's ""Sunday Morning."" She discussed how her life has changed since becoming famous and how she feels that she no longer has any freedom due to the attention she receives.

politifact15334,"‘Smallville’ star Allison Mack has confessed that she sold children to the Rothschilds and Clintons during her time in the child sex cult.According to police, Allison Mack worked in a senior management position for the Hollywood pedophile cult NXIVM. As second-in-command, it was her job to lure children into the cult in order to sell them to elite Hollywood pedophiles and powerful politicians.Thefreethoughtproject.com reports: “As alleged in the indictment, Allison Mack recruited women to join what was purported to be a female mentorship group that was, in fact, created and led by Keith Raniere. The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants’ benefit,” U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue said in a statement.The cult was finally exposed when the daughter of former Dynasty actress Catherine Oxenberg became a member. Oxenberg told the New York Times that she became concerned after she saw that her 26-year-old daughter India was extremely emaciated from dieting, and was suffering from serious health problems.“Some people have said this is a voluntary sorority. The women I have spoken to tell a far different story,” Oxenberg said. “Coercion is not voluntary. Extortion is not voluntary. Blackmail is not voluntary.”When these accusations hit the news, other women, including actress Sarah Edmondson, came forward to all to tell the same story, of the blackmail, the branding, as well as the forced labor and forced sexual activity.Raniere is also accused of having a history of pedophilia, with accusations that stretch back over 20 years, involving girls as young as 12.In 2012, several women were interviewed by the Albany Times Union about the coercive sexual experiences that they had with Raniere when they were young girls. One of the women in the case was found dead of a gunshot wound before she was able to give the interview. Her death was ruled a suicide.The U.S. attorney’s office requested to have Raniere held without bail in a letter to the court stating that he was a known child predator.Although this extremely important detail is being left out of most mainstream reports, one of the main charges in the criminal indictment against Raniere and Mack is sex trafficking of children.A quick search for Allison Mack’s arrest report or charges—as reported by the mainstream media—will not yield any mention of children. Most mainstream reports only mention sex trafficking and ominously omit that the charges were for sex trafficking of children. Exactly why the media is refusing to report this remains a mystery.Another important aspect of this case that has been largely overlooked, is the connections that this organization has to high-level figures in politics and finance. The organization worked much like a pyramid scheme, collecting regular fees from its members. But the majority of the funding, over $150 million, came from the trust funds of Seagram heiresses, Sara and Clare Bronfman.Their involvement with Raniere began in 2002 and has been very public and controversial, with other members of the Bronfman family distancing themselves from the sisters in the press. The Bronfman family has very close ties to the Rothschild banking dynasty, with members of both families belonging to many of the same companies, including their joint financial firm, Bronfman & Rothschild.Additionally, at least three high-ranking members of the organization, including Nancy Salzman and the Bronfman sisters, are members of Bill Clinton’s foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, which requires an annual $15,000 membership fee.Now that Raniere is in jail and Mack is on bail and ordered not to have any contact with other cult members, Clare Bronfman has taken on the role of leader within the organization.In response to the recent controversy surrounding NXIVM, Bronfman made a statement on her website denying the accusations against Raniere.

politifact15146,"The Democrats mulling a run for the White House in 2020 are facing intense pressure from liberals to campaign on abolishing the agency that enforces federal immigration laws, a proposal that was once relegated to the far-left fringe.In protesting the Trump administration’s policies toward illegal immigration, liberal commentators and writers have been embracing the idea of gutting the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which identifies, arrests and deports illegal immigrants inside the United States.“This is a growing position on the left, and I imagine 2020 Democratic presidential aspirants will have to grapple with it,” liberal writer and MSNBC host Chris Hayes tweeted.In January, the idea was endorsed by Brian Fallon, a former top aide to 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and Eric Holder, President Barack Obama’s attorney general. The Daily Caller first drew attention to the calls.“ICE operates as an unaccountable deportation force,” Fallon tweeted. “Dems running in 2020 should campaign on ending the agency in its current form.”Thomas Homan, the acting director of ICE, has reacted to these calls by Democrats by saying they should speak to victims of illegal immigrant crime.“These politicians, they need to talk to the victims of alien crime, talk to the parents that I talk to that lost children at the hands of criminal aliens,” Homan said Thursday on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight.”But the idea has picked up steam in recent days after Hayes, the MSNBC host, asked Democratic California Sen.

Upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home’s basement.According to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement.

If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped, I would figure out a way to obtain them, but they don’t, so I stick to what works for me”.Upon searching the home’s basement, police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter, but upon further inspection, police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances.Police also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals.In addition to the refrigerator, the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift ‘tool wall’ that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims.Upon their initial investigation, police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence.Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning.“Though modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist.

New Year is just one of those things where you can use a break to make plans. However, if you involve other people in your plans, there's no guarantee that they will come to fruition. The adverb ""ничего"" can mean ""not badly"" or ""quite well"" in English. It's important to know how to spell ""ничего"" correctly. ""Нечего"" is another form of the word that is used in a different context. Both ""ничего"" and ""нечего"" are correct, depending on the situation. When using the word ""ничего,"" it is always written as one word. If there are prepositions between the particles ""ни"" and the pronoun, it should be written separately. It's important to understand the different contexts in which ""ничего"" and ""нечего"" are used, as well as how to spell them correctly.",paraphrase_generation

During the 2011 wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, the Obamas were left off the guest list due to added security costs. Protests against Trump have been seen before in the UK, with 2 million people intending to take part in a protest against him during his planned state visit.

politifact15545,"8.9k SHARES SHARE THIS STORYPresident Trump made a barely veiled threat today on Twitter to Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) after the congresswoman called for the continued public shaming of members of his administration to hold them accountable for the president’s heinous policies, particularly the immigration policy debacle that led to the separation of thousands of children from their refugee parents at the border.Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2018Trump, of course, lied about what Rep. Waters called for which was peaceful protests and public demonstrations rather than the “harm” he claims. The “Be careful what you wish for Max!” quote, however, was a dog whistle call to action for his supporters to attack Rep. Waters on par with his warning during his campaign when discussing Hillary Clinton that perhaps “the Second Amendment people” i.e., gun owners could solve the problem.While some people may consider Trump’s tweet as more cheap theatrics for his base, the president’s hate-mongering towards Waters has real-life consequences as the news today about a San Pedro, California man demonstrates.Anthony Scott Lloyd, 45, is expected to plead guilty today to a charge of threatening to kill Rep. Maxine Waters because of her criticism of President Trump.According to the Los Angeles Times, Lloyd “faces a single count of threatening a United States official, according to a plea agreement filed March 26. It is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.”Lloyd’s plea details the voicemail that he left at Congresswoman Waters’ Washington DC office last October that used both a racial slur and an anti-gay epithet to refer to the representative and stated that:“If you continue to make threats towards the president, you’re going to wind up dead, Maxine, ’cause we’ll kill you.“The voicemail was forwarded to the FBI who investigated it and arrested Lloyd who claims that the call was a “spur of the moment” decision made while listening to conservative talk radio and that he had no real intention of following through with the threat.Unfortunately, we have no such assurances from the president himself, and given Trump’s penchant for simply ignoring the rule of law, that is a frightening proposition.The contrast here is stark between Trump and Waters and the other Democrats whose calls for peaceful activism through public declarations of disgust and shaming of deplorable policies and behaviors are met by Trump and his Republican enablers with threats laden with hints of violence.When those threats lead deranged Trump supporters to take action beyond mere threatening phone calls, the responsibility for incitement to violence will be squarely at Trump’s feet.Add your name to millions demanding Congress take action on the President’s crimes.

On paper, the land was owned by the allegedly defunct Solyndra Corporation, a startup solar company to which Obama gave 2.2 billion taxpayer dollars in 2009. Shortly thereafter, Solyndra declared bankruptcy, and the money vanished. Despite apparent poverty, Solyndra maintained real estate holdings valued at over 800 million dollars in a half-dozen Southeast Asian countries. The Trump administration connected the dots, linking Obama to the Thai property, after asserting Presidential privilege and subpoenaing flight records that demonstrably proved Obama had travelled to Si Sa Ket six times as president and an additional four times in the past year.In a June 2009 edition of the Washington Beacon, conservative author Thomas Clearwater wrote, “Solyndra does not appear to be a legitimate institution, and is likely a shell company or slush fund used or owned by Obama to launder his dirty money.”Our Secret Service source supports that contention.“Obama holds real estate, vast sums of currency, and shadow companies across the globe, under many aliases.

Makes sense, they both hate an armed citizenry,” one meme shared on Reddit’s conservative page r/TheDonald. It was shared on social media through variations of the theme, including one by conservative commentator Andrew Wilkow. González’s father migrated from Cuba to the United States.As The Post’s Samantha Schmidt reported, the flag came under attack Sunday from the campaign of Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa).“This is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet don’t speak Spanish and ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens; hence their right to self defense,” said a post on King’s campaign page on Facebook. The post also included a photo of González at the podium Saturday.A self-identified conservative Parkland student also has been buttressed by the right, which thinks he identifies with its politics — a de facto foil to his classmates. Kyle Kashuv, 16, visited President Trump and five Republican U.S. senators just three weeks after the killings to offer alternatives in the debate.“The initial movement, in its purest form, was amazing. It got corrupted because now it’s represented as anti-gun and anti-NRA. ‘Boycott this, boycott that.’ It’s detracting from the actual discussions,” Kashuv told The Post’s Dan Zak about the work of his classmates.Since then, Kashuv has been an occasional guest on Fox News Channel, sometimes calling for middle ground with fellow classmates and among those who disagree in the debate. Kashuv has echoed critics on the right that a focus on law-enforcement failures, not gun laws, is the way forward.But he has also targeted his classmates on the conservative media circuit.Hogg’s comments at the rally were “egregious and inflammatory,” Kashuv said on Fox News on Saturday, and he has criticized Hogg numerous times on Twitter. On Sunday, Kashuv challenged classmate Cameron Kasky to a debate. His argument has been bolstered by the NRA, which has published videos decrying Hogg’s use of explicit language and suggesting his activist peers","The use of teenage figureheads in the March for Our Lives movement has had a significant impact and has injected hope among liberal activists who support gun control. Emma González has become a prominent figurehead in this movement, appearing in numerous newspapers and magazines, and in a leading position at the Washington rally. However, some conservative groups have attacked González, circulating a doctored animation of her tearing apart the U.S. Constitution and accusing her of being a communist due to her Cuban heritage.

politifact14311,"(Jim Lo Scalzo for USN&WR)1. One of six children (and the only daughter), Nancy (Patricia D'Alesandro) Pelosi was born on March 26, 1940, and grew up in Baltimore's Little Italy.2. Pelosi's father, Tommy D'Alesandro, was a legendary Democratic congressman and Baltimore mayor. Her brother Thomas would also go on to become mayor of Baltimore.3. Seemingly, Pelosi was a Democrat from birth—as a young girl, she was offered a toy elephant by a Republican poll worker but recoiled, refusing the toy.4. A devout Catholic, Pelosi attended a Roman Catholic women's college, Trinity College, in Washington, D.C., where she met her future husband, Paul Pelosi, who was attending Georgetown. They eventually relocated to his hometown, San Francisco.5. Pelosi is mother to five—Nancy Corinne, Christine, Jacqueline, Paul, and Alexandra, all born within six years—and grandmother to five.6. Although active in politics her whole life—including stints as a leading Democratic fundraiser and chairwoman of the party in California—Pelosi didn't run for office until she was 47, preferring to wait until the youngest of her five children was a high school senior before running for Congress in 1987.7. Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman said that she was neither a ""new Democrat"" nor an ""old Democrat"" but a ""prehistoric Democrat."" Other Republicans call her a ""latte Democrat"" for her politically progressive views on the environment, women's reproductive rights, labor unions, and other issues.8. Pelosi has been a formidable force within the Democratic Party, raising more money than any other congressional Democrat–around $100 million since taking the reins of party leadership. And she has managed to keep the House Dems toeing the party line: According to Congressional Quarterly, House Democrats voted with the majority of their party 88 percent of the time in 2005, the highest total since CQ started keeping track in 1956.9. Pelosi learned the art of politics from her father, a practitioner of old-school politics.

One of six children (and the only daughter), Nancy (Patricia D'Alesandro) Pelosi was born on March 26, 1940, and grew up in Baltimore's Little Italy.2. Pelosi's father, Tommy D'Alesandro, was a legendary Democratic congressman and Baltimore mayor. Her brother Thomas would also go on to become mayor of Baltimore.3. Seemingly, Pelosi was a Democrat from birth—as a young girl, she was offered a toy elephant by a Republican poll worker but recoiled, refusing the toy.4. A devout Catholic, Pelosi attended a Roman Catholic women's college, Trinity College, in Washington, D.C., where she met her future husband, Paul Pelosi, who was attending Georgetown. They eventually relocated to his hometown, San Francisco.5. Pelosi is mother to five—Nancy Corinne, Christine, Jacqueline, Paul, and Alexandra, all born within six years—and grandmother to five.6. Although active in politics her whole life—including stints as a leading Democratic fundraiser and chairwoman of the party in California—Pelosi didn't run for office until she was 47, preferring to wait until the youngest of her five children was a high school senior before running for Congress in 1987.7. Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman said that she was neither a ""new Democrat"" nor an ""old Democrat"" but a ""prehistoric Democrat."" Other Republicans call her a ""latte Democrat"" for her politically progressive views on the environment, women's reproductive rights, labor unions, and other issues.8. Pelosi has been a formidable force within the Democratic Party, raising more money than any other congressional Democrat–around $100 million since taking the reins of party leadership. And she has managed to keep the House Dems toeing the party line: According to Congressional Quarterly, House Democrats voted with the majority of their party 88 percent of the time in 2005, the highest total since CQ started keeping track in 1956.9. Pelosi learned the art of politics from her father, a practitioner of old-school politics.

And Gov. Mike Pence recently signed it. The bill is stuffed with as many asinine restrictions on abortion with an eye towards making abortion as miserable and humiliating an experience as possible, and ideally something women can’t get legally at all.Asked to comment on his approval of a piece of legislation that basically promotes hatred towards women once stripped of all the legal terms, Pence argued in an interview with The Huffington Post that “abortion as such was a mistake since the day it was first invented.” “So, let’s get that straight right away – I oppose abortion for any reason whatsoever because I believe that killing someone, or something, if you will, that hasn’t developed a consciousness just yet is the ultimate act of crime. And if we’re murderers of innocent beings who can’t defend themselves, how are we to expect people with a fully developed consciousness to stop murdering each other?” the Indiana governor said.“And as if that wasn’t enough,” Pence continued, “we’ve got this situation now throughout different states where some lawmakers allow abortion under some circumstances like rape or when the fetus is diagnosed with an illness, and others just flat out prohibit it. And that’s bad for a number of reasons. First and foremost – we can’t have this kind of freedom of choice. This is bad, let’s be clear. And that’s part of the reason why I signed this bill, because I believe abortion, or I’m going to flat out call it murder, this murdering of children has to stop and it has to be prohibited in every state. So Indiana is just a step in the right direction.”Pence also tried to offer his opinion on what would have happened had he allowed rape victims to still have abortion. “First and foremost, because this is such a sensitive topic, let me just say that I sympathize with rape victims not just in America, but around the world. I can only imagine what it must be like to experience such trauma,” he said. “However, that does not justify murder, not even that justifies murdering a baby, not in my book.

What if women would go out and get raped on purpose just so they could get off work? I mean, Indiana’s economy is struggling as it is, and having thousands of women absent from their jobs would be horrific for the state, I’m telling you. I made the right call and that will be confirmed in the long run,” Pence concluded.","The ongoing Republican campaign against women remains unrelenting. The GOP recently argued in the Supreme Court that contraceptive coverage should not be available outside of an employer's health plan. Furthermore, Indiana has joined the likes of Texas and Florida by passing a restrictive law that supposedly protects women but in actuality, makes it more difficult for them to access safe abortions, putting their health in danger. Governor Mike Pence has signed this law, which aims to make the entire process of obtaining abortion as unpleasant as possible and thereby prevent women from obtaining one legally at all. When questioned about the bill's approval, Pence claimed that he opposes abortion because terminating a life that has not yet had a chance to develop consciousness is the ultimate crime. He wants to prohibit it in every state because allowing some abortion exceptions will lead to widespread abuse of the system, with women falsely claiming to have been raped to receive abortions using taxpayer money. Pence believes that denying women the option of abortion is the right decision, as he is concerned that allowing rape victims to terminate their pregnancy would lead to a significant drop in the state workforce's productivity due to the number of women taking time off to recover from the procedure.",paraphrase_generation

politifact15539,"Less than one week after kicking out White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and continuing to harass her family, “Red Hen” owner Stephanie Wilkinson finally received a bitter taste of her own intolerant medicine.When conservatives encounter someone with whom they disagree, they try to engage in meaningful debate. With liberals, there is only resistance. Instead of inviting civil discourse, leftist ideologues are resorting to suppression, harassment, and even physical violence in response to “problematic” ideas. Of course, they’re quickly discovering that their juvenile and fascist actions have consequences.On Friday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her extended family members, many of whom are liberals, were forced out of the Red Hen eatery in Lexington, Virginia, by co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson. Although the party politely obliged the indignant staffers, Wilkinson proceeded to gather her comrades and stalk Sanders’ family at another restaurant, screaming insults and demanding they leave. Now that word of her behavior is national news, Wilkinson is being forced to live by her own principles.Red Hen co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson has not only been forced to step down as executive director of Main Street Lexington, according to Fox News, she’s also placed herself in the center of what could turn into a massive lawsuit for damages concerning the effect her discrimination against Sarah Huckabee Sanders has had on Red Hen establishments across the country. Along with her resignation from the organization, Wilkinson’s bigotry has caused unaffiliated Red Hen restaurants across the U.S. to suffer protests, negative reviews, and boycotts, CBS News reports.Main Street Lexington president Elizabeth Outland Branner offered a short response in reference to Wilkinson’s resignation, which is undoubtedly a move toward damage control for the group, which represents many local businesses.“Considering the events of the past weekend, Stephanie felt it best that for the continued success of Main Street Lexington, she should step aside,” Branner wrote in an email.Wilkinson has caused such severe damage to other like-named establishments that business owners are desperately addressing the public outrage by disavowing the disgraced liberal feminist and declaring that it is illegal to refuse service to customers based on their political leanings.More than 4,300 replied, including multiple tweets calling on the restaurant to condone Sanders and the Trump administration’s actions. The Red Hen answered the threats by defining “unaffiliated” as well as an explanation that it is illegal for businesses in the District of Columbia to discriminate against people because of their political views.Another Red Hen restaurant, this one in Swedesboro, New Jersey, also faced a slew of angry calls and social media posts for refusing to serve a woman who’d never stepped through their door.“Kindly check your facts before you erroneously defame an innocent victim on Facebook,” said a post on the family-owned restaurant’s Facebook page.The manager of a New Jersey-based restaurant with the same name lamented that their location’s rating has plummetted from “4.8 stars to three-point-something.” An owner in Saybrook, Connecticut, attempted to prevent this same damage by adding a pop-up box stating that their restaurant has “absolutely no affiliation with any other Red Hen restaurant anywhere else.”Wilkinson has defended her discriminatory actions, ironically claiming that she doesn’t enjoy “confrontation” but feels a moral duty to harass political figures and their innocent family members.“I’m not a huge fan of confrontation,” Wilkinson told The Post. “I have a business, and I want the business to thrive.” But, she went on to say, “This feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals.”When the mainstream media propagates that those with certain political views are “Na",1,en,"Less than one week after kicking out White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and continuing to harass her family, “Red Hen” owner Stephanie Wilkinson finally received a bitter taste of her own intolerant medicine.When conservatives encounter someone with whom they disagree, they try to engage in meaningful debate.

politifact13560,"The announcement that Mall of America was welcoming its first black Santa Claus was greeted in many quarters as a good thing but, as might be expected in a country that has become increasingly more comfortable saying any racist thing that comes to mind, many were highly offended. Three years after Fox’s Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America dismissed her advice and hired Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors.Among many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the company’s actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and “running Mall of America into the ground,” on the basis of Santa “always having been white in the Bible.” “No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,” Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.She also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was “the last straw” in corporate America’s twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, “because they realized they couldn’t make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques they’ve been using so far.” She added, “That’s why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they won’t shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I don’t understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that.”“That’s why Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again,” Palin added. “The Holy Book always said Santa Claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. And we need to make an example out of Mall of America. If we don’t, if we let them get away with it, what’s next?

Kennedy, which ultimately allows the NFL to classify itself as “entertainment” rather than sport, as well as incorporate itself as a single entity, instead of the 32 separate “franchises” they would want you to believe.In a 2004 lawsuit, the NFL argued they are not a collection of 32 teams in competition with each other. They argued they are a single entity, providing “entertainment” in the marketplace, and as such they are not subject to Anti-Trust laws.The only other “sport” that occupies this legal position is the WWE.How are games rigged?According to Goodes, the fat cat franchise owners and their pampered players do not care who wins, as long as they continue reaping the lucrative financial benefits provided by the system.“Have you ever stopped to wonder how Vegas makes the point spread line and over under so close every week? There is not one game where the result totally blows away the point spread or the over under. It doesn’t happen. Are they that good? Hell, no they’re not. Even the best of the best cannot get it so close every singl","An NFL entertainment lawyer who had been working with the league for over 15 years was found dead in New York City a few hours after claiming that the Super Bowl LII was fixed. Dan Goodes, who was representing the NFL in Minneapolis, accused them of being corrupt and orchestrating a rigged game that would earn maximum revenue for the league. He was allegedly removed from the premises but continued to speak out to reporters in the area. Goodes claimed that outcomes had been fixed to maximize profits ever since his early days in the league and that the NFL is officially registered as “entertainment,” just like WWE. According to Goodes, franchise owners and players do not care who wins as long as they continue reaping lucrative financial benefits provided by the system, and he asserted that Vegas never blows away the point spread line or over-under, which is a clear sign of games being rigged. Early reports claimed that Goodes was found shot dead in a 2017 BMW 2 Series alongside one other man who is believed to be a close friend, but later, such reports were removed from the internet.",paraphrase_generation

A short list of Francis’s most controversial statements include:PREACHING THAT ‘JESUS TURNED INTO SATAN’Pope Francis went where no other Christian, let alone Pope, had ever gone before, accusing Jesus of “debasing himself up to the point of totally annihilating himself”, and “turning into Satan.”Hardcore Francis apologists claim the quote was taken out of context, but when the passage is read in it’s entirety it is clear that Francis meant exactly what he said.Making matters worse, Pope Francis later doubled down, spreading Satanic doctrine further, when he said that Jesus Christ “made himself the devil, the serpent, for us,” according to L’Osservatore Romano, the daily newspaper of the Vatican.PREACHING THAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH JESUS ARE ‘HARMFUL’The heretical statement by Pope Francis comes after he broke with centuries of Christian tradition earlier this year, telling a crowd of 33,000 Catholics in Rome that “a personal, direct, immediate relationship with Jesus Christ” must be avoided at all costs.“Having a personal relationship with Jesus is dangerous and very harmful,” the pope said during the June 25 speech.The unconventional teachings of Pope Francis have caused Vatican Cardinals and senior priests to turn their back on the pontiff and refuse to pledge obedience to him.OPENLY CALLING FOR ‘ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT’In July this year Pope Francis told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that the United States of America has “a distorted vision of the world” and Americans must be ruled by a world government, as soon as possible, “for their own good.”The week before he also called for “a one world government” and “political authority”, arguing that the creation of the one world government is needed to combat major issues such as “climate change.”Speaking with Ecuador’s El Universo newspaper, the Pope said that the United Nations doesnt have enough power and must be granted full governmental control “for the good of humanity.”France’s Marine Le Pen described Pope Francis as a “globalist bulldog“.

It is a disgusting show of transphobia that has no place in our public schools; the GOP must accept that America is a multi-gendered, multi-ethnic nation, and no amount of perverted laws is going to change that.Download our NEW Occupy Democrats app for your iPhone by clicking here or for your Android by clicking here.Add your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President’s crimes. IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP!","The Republican party's discrimination towards transgender individuals and their attempts to enforce the idea of gender as a binary distinction have taken a bizarre turn with Mark Cole, a Virginia Republican, filing a bill that would require schools to inspect students' genitals before using gender-specific facilities. The bill would also isolate transgendered children in a single-person bathroom, which goes against the Department of Justice's ruling that it violates a student's rights.

In a 2016 Facebook post that appears in celebration of her graduation from Santa Clara University School of Law, Mateo proclaims publicly in Spanish –“Everything is dedicated to Oaxaca, Mexico!! to that land that I miss so much.”If she misses it so much? Why does she not return? After all, it is her homeland and the country of which is she is a citizen. Yet here she is in America, in a country in which her very presence is in defiance of the law she swears to uphold both as an attorney and officer of the court, and also as an officer of the California state government.It is important to note that while Mateo is the first “unprotected” illegal alien to hold a state office, she is not the first elevated to public office in California. In 2015, the city council of Huntington Park, California, appointed two illegal aliens to city commissions, sparking a public backlash.De León and other state officials are stoking an ongoing confrontation with the federal government over federal immigration laws.Many were also quick to point out Mateo’s hypocrisy in her chosen profession in the law and in government with her own illegal status and refusal to adhere federal immigration law. One Twitter user asked Mateo some very pointed and direct questions – “As someone who studies and practices the law, how can you at the same time flout the very principles of justice that law and order is based on?!?! You are a fraud and should answer for breaking the laws of this land.”In #lawschool I often wondered if I was fit to b in #lawjournal, #mootcourt bc not many ppl w/ my same background did. I always went for it bc even if I felt inadequate I thought I could add something of value. I hope to do the same w/ @StudentAidCommission. #undocumentedunafraid https://t.co/JpZOOhJfMU — Lizbeth Mateo, Esq. (@LizbethMateo) March 15, 2018Citing EdSource data, de Leon’s office said an estimated 72,300 undocumented students are enrolled in California’s public colleges and universities. (Of those, about 60,000 attend community colleges, 8,300 are in the California State University system and 4,000 are on University","The state of California has introduced a proposal that would allow illegal immigrants to serve on state and local boards and commissions, and an advisory committee called the ""California Student Opportunity and Access Program Project Grant Advisory Committee"" (Cal-SOAP) has appointed its first undocumented immigrant, Lizbeth Mateo. Mateo is an attorney and civil rights activist who came to the United States illegally with her parents when she was 14 years old. Mateo sees her appointment as a way to address the underrepresentation of illegal immigrants and to help students from underserved communities go to college. Senate Bill 174 made her appointment possible by amending state law to allow appointment of any resident over the age of 18 to a civil office regardless of citizenship or immigration status. Senator Ricardo Lara, the bill’s author, argues that illegal immigrants are part of the state's diverse community, and it is necessary to utilize the talents of all residents to better serve these communities. It is the first time the Senate has appointed someone living in the US illegally to a state post. However, Mateo has been criticized for her hypocrisy as she is an attorney and officer of the court who has sworn to uphold both state and federal immigration laws, but her very presence in the country is in defiance of these laws.",paraphrase_generation

But anyone else says the wrong words and they lose their jobs and are punished in many ways.

Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn’t comment.Mikerin was a director of Rosatom’s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom’s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom’s new American arm called Tenam.Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin “did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons … to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,” a November 2014 indictment stated.His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin’s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show.In evidentiary affidavits signed in 2014 and 2015, an Energy Department agent assigned to assist the FBI in the case testified that Mikerin","The FBI had strong evidence that Russian nuclear officials were involved in activities like bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering to benefit Vladimir Putin’s atomic energy business in the United States when the Obama administration green-lighted a controversial deal in 2010, which allowed Moscow to control a significant portion of US uranium, say interviews and government documents. An insider in the Russian nuclear industry helped federal agents obtain financial records, intercept emails and make covert recordings from as early as 2009, which illustrated that Moscow bribed and offered kickbacks to compromise an American uranium trucking firm in contravention of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. FBI and court documents reveal that they also gained an account, endorsed by documents, to demonstrate that millions of dollars had been sent by Russian nuclear officials to America to benefit Bill Clinton's charitable foundation at a time when Hillary Clinton served on a US government body. An agent swore in an affidavit years later that this racketeering scheme was carried out ""with the consent of higher level officials"" in Russia who received proceeds from the kickbacks. Instead of taking quick action in 2010, the Department of Justice chose to continue investigating the case for almost four more years, without speaking to the public or Congress about Russian nuclear corruption taking place on American soil, during a period where Obama’s government made two major decisions approving Moscow’s commercial nuclear aims.",paraphrase_generation

He claimed that the U.S. is turning into Sodom now that it has “enshrined sodomy into the United States Constitution” and cities like Houston are trying to “force women to go into men’s bathrooms and men to go into women’s bathrooms.”“Now it’s a constitutional right for sodomites to marry each other,” he lamented, warning that “the wrath of God is revealed against this stuff.” He explained: “I don’t want the wrath of God to hit this country, it’s a great country, I’d like to see America continue strong, but this is one way of weakening it. First of all, we’re going to have this financial collapse. We’re setting up for a massive financial collapse and I think if God is going to hurt this country that’s probably the way he’d do it.”At that point, a viewer called in and inquired Robertson whether his grim predictions of such a crisis can somehow be averted, to which Robertson gave a somewhat confusing answer: “I believe so, yes, but we need to stop spreading lesbianism and homosexuality in order to achieve that.

I’m thinking we need to go through the Senate with this and we need to make it official. That way, regular people would know that the person wearing the said color is a deviant sodomite and that they need to stay away from them at all cost, as well as keep their children away from their reach,” Robertson opined.The viewer then interrupted “The 700 Club” host to state that “that sounds awfully like what Nazis did to Jews in the events leading up to World War II,” referring to the fact that Jews in pre-WWII Poland and Germany were made to wear Jewish badges, or yellow badges, which were cloth patches that Jews were ordered to sew on their outer garments to mark them as Jews in public. It served as a badge of shame.“I don’t believe that,” Robertson quickly became defensive. “I am simply talking about protecting regular people in America, not setting out gays and lesbians as members of the population that should be tortured and slaughtered in concentration camps.

HE’S NOT AFRAID TO TAKE ON THE — THE BIG MOUTHS AROUND HERE.”O’Neal continued, “The president is smart, powerful and a good counterpuncher.I think he attacks anyone he perceives or believes is attacking him or the country.”“He should be given the Medal of Freedom for talking his mind in such a bold, honest, and straightforward manner.” O’Neal added.“THE REALITY IS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO START FIGHTING FOR THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER WITH HIM INSTEAD OF CRITICIZING AND WASTING THEIR TIME ON STUPID THINGS.” HE CONCLUDED.And Also What Ken Langone told CNBC:If President Donald Trump is able to keep defying expectations — like he did in the election — and push through legislative changes against great odds, he could go down as “one of our greatest presidents ever,” Ken Langone told CNBC on Monday.Langone, a longtime Republican supporter and the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot, said the Trump presidency offers the GOP, which also controls the House and the Senate, a unique time to deliver on the reasons Americans voted for a political outsider for the White House.Voters are “fed up,” Langone said on “Squawk Box.” “They did a very dramatic, earth-shattering thing,” and now want results, he said.Langone warned the Republicans that they could lose their majorities in the House and the Senate if lawmakers fail to seize this Trump-created opportunity. “We own the next 25 years as a nation [if we act].”“If you guys don’t get your guys into a room and say ‘Guys this is our moment.’ The American people will throw you out too, the next time,” he warned House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy who also appeared as a guest Monday on “Squawk Box.”“[Trump] has the capacity to go down as one of our greatest presidents ever” if he’s able to bring about big changes in health care, tax cuts and $1 trillion of infrastructure upgrades, Langone said.“The American people elected him president, in my mind, for one reason: they don’t want incremental change. They want major change,” said Langone, founder and CEO of investment bank Invemed Associates, specializing in health-care and high-technology companiesThe Home Depot co-founder also came out in favor of the House GOP’s border adjustment tax provision to help pay for their overall effort to cut corporate taxes.Many retailers are against the idea of taxing imports, saying it will force them to raise prices.But Langone argued that retailers, like Home Depot, would be better off in the long term if they’re able to “think beyond the next quarter or the next six months.”Like this: Like Loading...","In response to President Trump retweeting controversial videos, Senator Orrin Hatch praised him as one of the best presidents he has served under, citing his fearlessness in making decisions and taking on critics. Similarly, billionaire businessman Ken Langone believes that if Trump can continue to defy expectations and push through legislative changes, he has the potential to be one of the greatest presidents ever. Langone urged Republicans to take advantage of this unique opportunity or risk losing their majorities in the House and Senate. He also supported the House GOP's border adjustment tax provision, arguing that retailers would benefit in the long term if they can think beyond short-term gains.",paraphrase_generation

This is very early in a tenure and to have former presidents being critical of the president… is pretty unusual.”As Obama returns to the public spotlight, his former aides have made it clear he has no intention of talking much about Trump. However, he’s made his displeasure clear.Obama, who campaigned heavily for Hillary Clinton, said he was “heartened” by the protests following Trump’s immigration ban targeting Muslim-majority countries.

Stuart Eizenstat, Carter’s chief domestic policy adviser and a former ambassador, said it usually takes an extraordinary occurrence for a former president to criticize a sitting president.“There’s a recognition that there is something so unique and special about the presidency, that, notwithstanding what might be very deep and serious policy differences and personal understandings, you simply bite your tongue,” he said. “You don’t try to undercut the president because you know what impact that would have had when you were president.”The most reliable politics newsletter.

Former aides say particularly on foreign policy issues, previous presidents and statesmen can be a valuable resource.“Most of the time President Clinton reached out to former heads of state, or people like Henry Kissinger or James Baker, they were usually foreign policy issues, where you had a perspective there that was pretty unique on dealing with a similar situation,” Mack McLarty, Clinton’s former chief of staff, said.For example, Carter worked with former President Gerald Ford on the treaties which turned control of the Panama Canal over to Panama. Eizenstat said Carter instructed negotiator Sol Linowitz to call Ford immediately after the deal was ratified.Others primarily use their predecessors for humanitarian trips.

While Sanders’ story itself did not contain religious content or exclude non-Christians, the message she attached to it was undeniably sectarian.

It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie.

They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal”, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. “Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern”, said Dr. Polowotski. “Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution”.

House Oversign Committee Chair Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, asked for the alleged Comey memo and other documents. Chaffetz tweeted that he is prepared to subpoena the information. And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., invoked “Watergate.”Now the Democratic Party is reportedly poll testing impeachment as a 2018 election issue. More than 1 million people signed a petition calling","If the Deep State tries to bring down President Trump, it will have dire consequences as Americans are prepared to fight and die for their God-given freedoms. The corruption in Washington has disgusted the majority of military voters, police, and NRA members who are well-armed and trained. Democrats and some Republicans have launched a coup attempt against Trump because they fear he will reveal the vast corruption in the government that has defrauded American taxpayers. Washington's elites have gone to war to unseat Trump, and it's time for Americans to make their voices heard before things turn very ugly.",paraphrase_generation

Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, recently wrote a book entitled, “On Behalf of the President: Presidential Spouses and White House Communications Strategy Today.”Wright diagnosed Mrs. Obama’s recent behavior. She has become an attack dog in an effort to help Obama build his legacy as the last days of his presidency slip away.“She’s in legacy building mode. She doesn’t have to worry about the implications [of her remarks] for months to come,” Wright said. “This is the time she’s most free to say what she feels, what she believes, and what she wants the message to be for the public.”As First Lady, Obama has given more public speeches and indulged more appearances than any First Lady in history, Wright reported in her book.“I think what surprises and upsets people most often is that first ladies give more public remarks than vice presidents, and that’s been true over the last three administrations,” she wrote.Of her biggest, and most disturbing claims she made in her campaign of hate against the country was that America is a racist nation who needed her husband in office and that she’s now suffering a feeling of “hopelessness” with Trump in office. Doubling down on that disrespectful sentiment is that she said she was never proud of America until her husband got elected to the White House. It’s ironic how Michelle says Barrack was successful in inspiring hope in the nation after everyone overwhelmingly voted Trump in, desperate for the hope his predecessor promised and failed to deliver on.The best case of revenge was how miserably she failed at building her legacy and trying to save it in the final days, especially now, that Trump just took the final sledgehammer to her most beloved project.

Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, recently wrote a book entitled, “On Behalf of the President: Presidential Spouses and White House Communications Strategy Today.”Wright diagnosed Mrs. Obama’s recent behavior. She has become an attack dog in an effort to help Obama build his legacy as the last days of his presidency slip away.“She’s in legacy building mode. She doesn’t have to worry about the implications [of her remarks] for months to come,” Wright said. “This is the time she’s most free to say what she feels, what she believes, and what she wants the message to be for the public.”As First Lady, Obama has given more public speeches and indulged more appearances than any First Lady in history, Wright reported in her book.“I think what surprises and upsets people most often is that first ladies give more public remarks than vice presidents, and that’s been true over the last three administrations,” she wrote.Of her biggest, and most disturbing claims she made in her campaign of hate against the country was that America is a racist nation who needed her husband in office and that she’s now suffering a feeling of “hopelessness” with Trump in office. Doubling down on that disrespectful sentiment is that she said she was never proud of America until her husband got elected to the White House. It’s ironic how Michelle says Barrack was successful in inspiring hope in the nation after everyone overwhelmingly voted Trump in, desperate for the hope his predecessor promised and failed to deliver on.The best case of revenge was how miserably she failed at building her legacy and trying to save it in the final days, especially now, that Trump just took the final sledgehammer to her most beloved project. After her disastrous lunch program crumbled around her and even her biggest supporters were critical of the changes she made to school meals, her nemesis, Trump, came in and reversed all she had done. He then topped it off by giving kids back their chocolate milk that she had ridiculously robbed them of.Dean James from America’s Freedom Fighters let loose on Michelle and her nasty claims about our coun","Michelle Obama has recently been publicly criticizing President Trump whenever she gets the chance, despite mostly staying out of the public eye since leaving the White House. Many have been questioning her behavior, and a doctor, Dr. Lauren A. Wright, has unofficially diagnosed her with being in ""legacy mode"" and trying to help her husband build his legacy before leaving office. Wright notes that as First Lady, Michelle gave more public speeches and appearances than any other before her. She has made controversial claims about the country being racist and feeling hopeless with Trump in office. Her failed attempts at legacy-building, such as her school lunch program, have been reversed by Trump.",paraphrase_generation

This could lead to dramatic hearings, as Strzok could expose more information about those probes, and is central to President Trump’s effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.Reports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBI’s conduct during the 2016 election. Strzok’s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok “intends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him.”The letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.” The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with “specific investigative decisions,” but said that comment and others “implies a willingness to take official action.”Strzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldn’t be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trump’s odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that there’s “no question” that Strzok regrets sending the messages, but that “I think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation, and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation.”Mueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts.Goelman said that if asked to testify, Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity, and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. He said the agent “intends to answer any question put to him, and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation, the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that that’s a topic, and his own integrity.”Trump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night, which are not supported by the inspector general’s findings.

They could never have known that a drunk 24-year-old, Marin Heidgen, was also on the road. Heidgen, driving on the wrong side of the road, hit the limo head-on, causing a devastating accident.Police reports revealed that Heidgen’s blood alcohol level was more than three times the legal limit. He had consumed at least 14 drinks and had been driving at 70 miles an hour, on the wrong side of the highway, for at least two miles before the catastrophic accident occurred.The driver of the limousine, 59-year-old Stanley Rabinowitz, was killed instantly after being crushed by the engine. The bride’s father, Christopher, broke both of his legs in several places after being thrown to the floor. He later had to have one amputated. His wife, Denise, was also seriously injured, and little Grace was stuck in the folds of the wreckage.Despite having a broken back, Neil attempted to crawl from the car to seek help. Meanwhile, Jennifer, who had injured her foot, was desperately searching for Katie, who had been lying on the side seat at the time of the crash.Then, Jennifer Flynn came across something that no mother should ever have to witness – her daughter, Katie, had been decapitated by her own seat-belt.One of the first responders on the scene was Michael Tangney, the bride’s uncle and a policeman himself. He had been at the wedding just hours before:“I was walking to the rear of the limousine when a gentleman was coming away from it, and he said, ‘Don’t go back there. It’s bad,’” Michael Tangney said. “I opened the rear door to the limousine and realized it was my family.”But, tragically, the worst was yet to come.Michael Tagney would witness Jennifer emerging from the wreck with her daughter’s head in her hands. Katie’s body remained in the car, still in the dress she had proudly worn for the wedding only a few hours previous.For the next hour, Jennifer sat next to the road. She kept Katie’s head on her lap and watched as the rest of her family was freed from the wreckage of the destroyed vehicle.Eventually, she let her daughter go; handing her to Michael. Before she did so, she kissed her daughter’s face one last time.The event altered the lives of the whole family. Martin Heidgen was sentenced to 18 years in prison for two counts of second-degree murder – though nothing, of course, can ever bring back Jennifer’s daughter.Jennifer and Neil have bravely chosen to talk openly about their story, in the hope that it might prevent a similar catastrophe from happening again.“Since no one should have to live the life I do, I felt a responsibility, an obligation, to stand up and tell our story,” Jennifer said.“I hope that by experiencing the devastation that we survived that night, and still continue to live through, people can see the seriousness of drunk driving as the crime it really is.

politifact15494,"A dispute in Angela Merkel’s coalition over migration policy has swiftly escalated into one of the biggest tests of her chancellorship.The clash has opened a rift at the heart of the German leader’s own camp, between her Christian Democratic Union and its CSU Bavarian sister party. How the conflict is resolved will determine the chancellor’s fate, possibly as soon as Monday.Horst Seehofer, Merkel’s interior minister and the leader of Bavaria’s Christian Social Union, wants to force through a plan to send back migrants who have already registered for asylum in other European Union states. Merkel rejects the proposal as offloading the burden on neighboring states, and says it would kill efforts to forge a bloc-wide response to the continent’s struggle with migration.Bavarian lawmakers are fully behind Seehofer, while Merkel has wrested a majority in the larger CDU group for her position. The standoff is a replay of tensions that have periodically bubbled up between Merkel and Seehofer since the height of the refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016, only this time there is no obvious way out. Following are some potential scenarios:CompromiseThe two parties have managed to eke out a compromise after each previous conflict. Overtures could begin on Monday, when the CSU party executive meets in Munich. Seehofer could give Merkel what she wants: two weeks to forge bilateral accords with countries such as Italy and Greece to return registered asylum seekers.Merkel could also give ground, as for example the newspaper Die Welt advocates. She could put forward another proposal to assuage the CSU that may yield a compromise. But if she caves in to the Bavarian demands as they stand, it would be an unprecedented loss of authority that would render her a lame duck leader.No CompromiseIn the absence of a face-saving deal, the real clash could come as early as Monday. That’s when Seehofer has indicated he will start to implement his plan at the border. As interior minister, Seehofer has the authority to do so, even in the face of Merkel’s rejection. The only way for the chancellor to forestall a unilateral decision by her minister would be to fire him. Sacking her top Bavarian ally would be a historic first. If it happens, it’s hard to see how the coalition continues.Even if it doesn’t come to that and Merkel is given until the June 28-29 EU summit to reach bilateral agreements, it may only delayed the clash, since there is no guarantee she can win deals with other other EU states. She has already called the prospect ambitious.Confidence voteFor a coalition to dissolve, the German constitution says the lower house of parliament, or Bundestag, has to call a vote of confidence. The CDU and CSU, with a combined 246 seats, and the SPD with 153, have a majority of 44 seats in the 709-seat Bundestag. Such a move would be the ultimate measure of support for Merkel as chancellor. Even if she is unable to rely on the CSU, or indeed all of her own party’s votes, on the specific issue of her stand on migration Merkel might be able to attract the support of the Greens, which have 67 seats.Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in an opinion piece on Friday that Merkel should short-circuit the squabbling and put her parliamentary support to the test with a confidence vote. It’s a tactic that her predecessor, Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, used to force through military support for the U.S. after the Sept. 11 attacks. He used it again in 2005 amid a party rebellion, and this time lost the confidence motion, forcing new elections.Merkel resignsShould the chancellor view her authority as irretrievably compromised, she could throw in the towel.

They allege Nuncera referred to African-Americans using several racial slurs and told his officers to position police dogs at high school basketball games to specifically intimidate African-Americans.Nucera abruptly retired in February after he learned his use of racially motivated force was under investigation.

FBI Special Agent Vernon Addison wrote in an affidavit that Nucera “has a significant history of making racist comments concerning African Americans, to whom he frequently referred to as ‘n*ggers'”. One of Nucera’s officers “made numerous recordings” of Nucera that “contained extremely offensive racist comments” over the course of a year because he was “alarmed” by Nucera’s racism, according to the affidavit.The federal charges against Nucera relate to a Sept. 1, 2016, police encounter involving an 18-year-old African-American man and 16-year-old African-American girl. A hotel manager called police because he said the pair hadn’t paid for their hotel room the night before and were swimming in the hotel pool. The FBI affidavit states that their encounter with police “escalated into a physical struggle,” that both teens “resisted arrest” and that one of the officers used pepper spray.AdvertisementAfter both teens were handcuffed, Nucera grabbed the 18-year-old’s head and slammed it “into the right side of the metal doorjamb,” according to the affidavit. An officer heard the 18-year-old’s head make “a loud thud” as it hit the doorjamb, the feds alleged. Officers said the 18-year-old wasn’t resisting when Nucera slammed his head, but had “stopped walking for a moment to loudly complain.” The use of force wasn’t reported to the department.Hours after the assault, Nucera was recorded telling an officer he was “f*cking tired” of African-Americans.“I’ll tell you what, it’s gonna get to the point where I could shoot one of these motherfuckers,” Nucera allegedly said. “And that n*ggerr bitch lady, she almost got it,” he said, referring to the 16-year-old girl’s aunt, who was present at the arrest. “Fucking nipple hanging bitch. I’m so tired of them, man.”Nucera allegedly said that black people should “stay the fuck out of Bordentown” and referred to the 18-year-old as “fucking little, fucking n****r.”In a separate incident noted in the report that occurred in November 2015, Nucera said he wished an African-American from Trenton who he believed had slashed the tires of a police vehicle would give him a reason to “put my hands” on him.“These n****rs are like ISIS, they have no value,” Nucera allegedly said. “They should line them all up and mow ’em down.

That includes being underhanded, manipulative, and cruel as possible.Within the course of Trump’s period in office, we have seen liberals do some shockingly dreadful things. They’ve insulted his wife by criticizing her intelligence, state of origin, as well as her accent, demonstrating who the real racists and sexists are.Liberals didn’t hesitate to question his children’s psychological health, even calling Barron handicapped.

politifact15210,"320 SHARES Share TweetPresident Trump is about to end the longstanding abuse of the American welfare system and ban migrants from getting free money and handouts for five years. The immigration rules will prohibit migrants from coming to the country and taking advantage of free American welfare money right away. It will slow down, or stop, chain migration while protecting American workers and potentially saving taxpayers money.What used to happen is that people would migrate to America and just live on the free money they received. That’s called welfare abuse. America is open to migrants, but perhaps we don’t want migrants who can’t fend for themselves. Maybe it’s better if people who are self-sufficient migrate to the country so that we can reduce the amount of citizens living off the system.President Trump wants to introduce a merit-based Green card system in which migrants compete for Visas. Migrants can earn points for themselves by learning to speak English, gaining job training or job offers, or doing something else that is considered a benefit to the America. The idea seems to be that in order for America to grant Visas or citizenship, the migrant has to give something back to the country. It’s as though the government wants to stop people coming to America and living off the system and would prefer people coming to the country to be contributors. Do something for America and America will do something for you.Migrants to those countries must compete for a limited number of visas by gaining points for English proficiency, competitive training, a job offer or another major achievement that benefits the host country.The concept, which is modeled after similar programs from Australia and Canada, is taking harsh criticism from activists. It’s like they want an open border policy where everyone gets free welfare money, but that would just be the downfall of America. If we observe what’s happening in Germany, with Merkel’s “come on in” policy, then we see a mass increase in horrible crimes like gang rape. Do we want mass amounts of migrant gang rape in America? There’s already enough trouble with crime in sanctuary cities that protect illegal immigrant criminals. Those folks should be deported because of their bad behavior and often violent crimes they commit on American people and even other immigrants.If America prevents immigrants from getting free benefits for five years, then that makes people think twice about coming here. If a family who thinks about crossing the border to start a new life knows that they cannot live for free, then they may not come at all. If they have possible jobs lined up and will be almost instantly integrating successfully with society, then that’s a great match. America is the land of the free, but not the land of the free money.Migrants who enter the United States cannot receive welfare during their first five years in the country, President Trump revealed from his upcoming immigration overhaul.“Just this week, we announced a historic immigration bill to create a merit-based Green Card system that ends the abuse of our welfare system, stops chain migration, and protects our workers and our economy,” he stated on his weekly radio address. “As an example, you cannot get welfare for five years when you come into our country.”“You cannot just come in like in past weeks, years, and decades, you come in immediately and start picking up welfare. For five years, you have to say you will not be asking or using our welfare systems.”Compare that to Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the border to millions of unvetted migrants who can’t speak German and lack employable skills, which dooms them to perpetual welfare paid by German taxpayers – and boredom that manifests into terrorist attacks against, once again, German taxpayers.Last year the German government admitted that only 2.8% of over 1.2 million migrants had gotten a job – but even then those statistics might be exaggerated, according to j",1,en,"320 SHARES Share TweetPresident Trump is about to end the longstanding abuse of the American welfare system and ban migrants from getting free money and handouts for five years.

politifact14700,"Congresswoman Maxine Waters has reignited her political career as one of the most outspoken leaders of the Trump “Resistance.” She regularly and often beats the drum of impeachment for the president. However, in August of 2010, it was Waters who was under legal scrutiny for her behavior as a government official. Waters was charged with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code.According to The Hill’s report from 2010:The House ethics committee on Monday outlined its charges against Rep. Maxine Waters, who is accused of helping a bank in which her husband owned stock secure federal bailout funds. The committee charged the 10-term California Democrat with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code in connection with her effort to arrange a 2008 meeting between Treasury officials and representatives with OneUnited bank. The panel said Waters, who sits on the Financial Services Committee, broke a House rule requiring members to behave in a way that reflects “creditably” on the chamber. The committee said that by trying to assist OneUnited, she stood to benefit directly, because her husband owned a sizable amount of stock that would have been “worthless” if the bank failed. The committee also accused Waters of violating the “spirit” of a House rule prohibiting lawmakers from using their positions for financial gain, as well as a government ethics statute banning the dispensing of “special favors.”The charges were delayed and stalled by members of the committee, and multiple attorneys in the case were fired. Ultimately, Waters was absolved of the charges.According to National Review:[Waters] walked away with a slap on the wrist from the toothless House Ethics Committee in 2012 after being charged with multiple ethics violations related to her meddling in minority-owned OneUnited Bank … As stockholders, they profited handsomely from their relationship with the bank. It was a mutually beneficial relationship. After Waters’s office personally intervened and lobbied the Treasury Department in 2008, OneUnited received $12 million in federal TARP bailout money — despite another government agency concluding that the bank operated “without effective underwriting standards” and engaged “in speculative investment practices.

Resist.",1,en,"Congresswoman Maxine Waters has reignited her political career as one of the most outspoken leaders of the Trump “Resistance.” She regularly and often beats the drum of impeachment for the president. However, in August of 2010, it was Waters who was under legal scrutiny for her behavior as a government official. Waters was charged with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code.According to The Hill’s report from 2010:The House ethics committee on Monday outlined its charges against Rep. Maxine Waters, who is accused of helping a bank in which her husband owned stock secure federal bailout funds. The committee charged the 10-term California Democrat with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code in connection with her effort to arrange a 2008 meeting between Treasury officials and representatives with OneUnited bank. The panel said Waters, who sits on the Financial Services Committee, broke a House rule requiring members to behave in a way that reflects “creditably” on the chamber. The committee said that by trying to assist OneUnited, she stood to benefit directly, because her husband owned a sizable amount of stock that would have been “worthless” if the bank failed. The committee also accused Waters of violating the “spirit” of a House rule prohibiting lawmakers from using their positions for financial gain, as well as a government ethics statute banning the dispensing of “special favors.”The charges were delayed and stalled by members of the committee, and multiple attorneys in the case were fired. Ultimately, Waters was absolved of the charges.According to National Review:[Waters] walked away with a slap on the wrist from the toothless House Ethics Committee in 2012 after being charged with multiple ethics violations related to her meddling in minority-owned OneUnited Bank … As stockholders, they profited handsomely from their relationship with the bank. It was a mutually beneficial relationship. After Waters’s office personally intervened and lobbied the Treasury Department in 2008, OneUnited received $12 million in federal TARP bailout money — despite another government agency concluding that the bank operated “without effective underwriting standards” and engaged “in speculative investment practices. After the federal bailout of Fannie/Freddie, OneUnited’s stock in the government-sponsored enterprises plunged to a value estimated at less than $5 million. Only through Waters’s intervention was OneUnited able to secure an emergency meeting with the Treasury and then-Secretary Henry Paulson.

It was alleged that she violated House rules and the ethics code by using her position in helping her husband's bank, OneUnited, receive federal bailout funds. The House ethics committee accused Waters of breaking the Chamber's rule on behaving in a manner that reflects credit on the House and using her position for financial gain. They also stated that her husband owned a significant amount of stock that would become worthless if the bank failed, hence her desire to help OneUnited. Despite accusations of corruption and various charges against her, Waters walked away from the case with a mere slap on the wrist from the Ethics committee in 2012.

They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal”, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. “Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern”, said Dr. Polowotski. “Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution”.

""We are in the process of researching this incident but see no evidence our CNN network feed was compromised last evening in Boston,"" Jeff Carlson, SVP and general manager of RCN Boston, said in a statement to multiple outlets.CNN has also released a statement: “The RCN cable operator in Boston aired inappropriate content for 30 minutes on CNN last night. CNN has asked for an explanation.” But that still doesn’t really verify that anything occurred.@solikearose 800-746-4726.

Thanks, Melissa — RCN (@RCNconnects) November 25, 2016The appeal of the story is obvious: a network news may have aired porn for a full 30 minutes. Hilarious! And the CNN program that was supposed to be on was Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown. It’s a layup for body-part puns.This is exactly how fake news spreadsBut this is exactly how fake news spreads. Even if porn was aired on CNN, it’s clear that a lot of publications ran with a story based on tweets from one person before verifying the facts. Many of the headlines already implicate CNN, claiming the channel aired 30 minutes of porn without giving any context.The stakes might not seem very high in this case, but fake news seems to have played a major role during the 2016 presidential campaign. Mistakes like this won’t be very funny when they cost us more than a laugh.","Several news sites ran a story based on one person's tweet claiming CNN broadcasted pornography instead of Anthony Bourdain's show, Parts Unknown, for about 30 minutes. The tweet was picked up by several news outlets, and many of the original stories did not include statements from CNN or RCN, the cable company that supposedly aired the porn. After the stories were published, fact-checking began. RCN released statements on twitter saying there is no evidence that porn was aired last night in Boston, where the original tweet came from. CNN has asked for an explanation from RCN. This is an example of how fake news can spread, and it highlights the importance of accurate reporting and fact-checking.",paraphrase_generation

In other words, she once again made remarks that would go viral, putting her back in the spotlight, but it’s in such a negative way that most people had to shake their heads and say “eeeeewwwwwww” right after what she said to the Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley.Gidley and Griffin were at the same event and Gidley was passing by the table she was sitting at. Griffin snapped at him by asking how he sleeps at night. Gidley replied that he sleeps well and said thanks. Then it seems like she said something else, and he asked if they were going to go at it right there on the spot, and that’s when Griffin went into the full nasty mode and talked with a repulsive next few words that had people questioning her behavior and gender at the same time.Here’s what happened in full detail courtesy of the Washington Blade: “The event is a celebration of the First Amendment. As a longtime LGBT rights advocate, a comedian and provocateur, Griffin has made a long and successful career out of exercising her First Amendment right to free speech. The stunt last year in which she posed with a mock severed head of Donald Trump — which needlessly led CNN to fire her from a longstanding New Year’s Eve hosting gig with Anderson Cooper — was a textbook case of satire, which is constitutionally protected speech.Thus, the decision to invite Griffin proved an easy and obvious one.

Inside the heavy purse was a stapler; it turns out she suffered a last-minute wardrobe malfunction leaving the hotel, breaking a strap on her gown.

When asked how her famous mom Maggie is at age 96, Griffin replied, “drunk.”The only awkward moment came when Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley tried to squeeze past our table. Griffin stopped him and said, “How do you sleep at night?” Gidley replied, “Very well, thank you.” When Griffin expressed doubt about that, Gidley asked, “Are we really going to do this?”That’s when things got interesting. Griffin, in her trademark style, retorted, “Yes we are, suck my d-ck! No, really, suck my d-ck!”There was some back-and-forth, then Gidley, who was holding a Tecate, announced he was off to enjoy his Mexican beer “before we build the wall and you can’t get these anymore.” That prompted a farewell “f-ck you” from Griffin, triggering nervous laughter around our table.”It sure sounds like they had a fun time exchanging comments before Kathy Griffin took it to the levels of a unprofessionalism, acting exactly like the person who couldn’t hold a job with the Squatty Potty.Even though she claims to be a comedian, there’s still a level of professionalism that people should exude when they’re not on stage. Griffin has been unable to differentiate that and consistently confuses real life for her stage life (or lack thereof).Griffin might have some fans, but she",1,en,"athy Griffin went off the rails again in another classless display that shows why her career as a comedian hasn’t been as successful as other well-known people much more successful than her.This time Griffin made repulsive comments that have people wondering if she has transitioned to the other gender while she’s been quietly hiding in the backend of the spotlight. In other words, she once again made remarks that would go viral, putting her back in the spotlight, but it’s in such a negative way that most people had to shake their heads and say “eeeeewwwwwww” right after what she said to the Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley.Gidley and Griffin were at the same event and Gidley was passing by the table she was sitting at. Griffin snapped at him by asking how he sleeps at night. Gidley replied that he sleeps well and said thanks. Then it seems like she said something else, and he asked if they were going to go at it right there on the spot, and that’s when Griffin went into the full nasty mode and talked with a repulsive next few words that had people questioning her behavior and gender at the same time.Here’s what happened in full detail courtesy of the Washington Blade: “The event is a celebration of the First Amendment. As a longtime LGBT rights advocate, a comedian and provocateur, Griffin has made a long and successful career out of exercising her First Amendment right to free speech. The stunt last year in which she posed with a mock severed head of Donald Trump — which needlessly led CNN to fire her from a longstanding New Year’s Eve hosting gig with Anderson Cooper — was a textbook case of satire, which is constitutionally protected speech.Thus, the decision to invite Griffin proved an easy and obvious one.

This incident at a First Amendment celebration event highlights Griffin's tendency to act unprofessionally and confuse her stage life with real life.

Those of us that criticize the so-called “religion of peace” are subjected to ridicule and even being attacked for our belief of how dangerous Muslims are. In Europe, those that speak out against Islam are being imprisoned for their belief. Courts are actually sentencing people for “Islam anti-blasphemy” laws. While this may be par for the course in Europe right now, it is not the way we roll in America, until now. Minnesota has just established a similar law.Anti-blasphemy laws are a huge victory for Muslims because it ensures their protection and in turn, allows them to continue acting in whatever manner they please all the while marching towards Sharia Law.According to Minneapolis’ local newspaper, the Star-Tribune, the hotline was set up as a way to target Trump supporters, who Muslims believe are the group of people most likely to “harass them.” The Star Tribune reported:The city of Minneapolis has set up a hotline for residents to report hate-crime incidents and other acts of intolerance.The service, operated through the city’s 311 helpline, is aimed to aid targets of any “harassing behaviors motivated by prejudice,” according to a city news release issued on Monday.The announcement comes amid signs of a recent surge of such incidents affecting Muslims and Jews across the country, many of which go unreported.“Since the general election, many of us have experienced, witnessed firsthand or heard of actions of: racism, xenophobia, sexism and bigotry directed at people here and in cities across the United States,” Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city’s website. “In no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated.”The city’s Department of Civil rights along with mayor is leading the charge for this government-enforced fascism, as this new hotline will now encourage citizens to turn in their neighbors for holding opinions deemed forbidden by the state. This hotline flies right in the face of our United States Constitution, where it goes to the heart of denying American citizens their inalienable rights of the First Amendment, which governments CAN NOT DO. Of course, the rabid liberals controlling the city have little regard for the Constitution or the rights of Americans, as they are using their position to establish a soft version of anti-blasphemy laws. “In no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated,” Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city’s website.The Department echoes the unconstitutional sentiments of Minneapolis’ mayor, Betsy Hodges, who went on to blast President Trump, pushing her insane narrative of there being an epidemic of bigotry and hate in our country since he got into office.

Minneapolis is being built and strengthened by people from all over the world and I am grateful for their commitment to our city.

This is only the beginning of the Democrats plans to take control of our country again, but what they don’t realize is that everyone will end up suffering if we continue to bow to Muslim’s demands.

Hodges says he has no regrets.In amongst his many confessions, he admits to being a group member of five CIA agents, whose sole task was to carry out assassinations. He also admits one of his assassinations being none other than Glamour icon, Marilyn Monroe, who was killed not just because of her ties with John F Kennedy, but also because she slept with Fidel Castro, ultimately making her a massive national security risk.Hodges says he has no regrets.He claims he carried out 37 assassinations for the US Government between 1959 and 1972 including Marilyn Monroe.Hodges had worked for the CIA.Hodges was a CIA officer for 41 years working as an operative amongst top level security clearances, he claims he was employed as a hit-man by the organization, his duty was to assassinate individuals who posed a threat to the security of the United States of America.He was trained as a sniper and a martial arts expert but also trained in other methods ranging from taking people out with poisons to using explosives.Despite his old age, Hodges has managed to recall each of the assassinations he committed for the CIA. He goes on to admit that the murders were carried out on American soil and by the orders of his then commanding officer, Major James “Jimmy” Hayworth.He also claims the timeline for the assassinations were between August 1959 and March 1972, when the “the CIA had its own agenda”. Furthermore, he admits that he was part of an operation team of five members, who were taking orders to carry out the assassinations. Their victims were from all walks of life ranging from journalists, union leaders, political activists, artists, and scientists – all of which were killed because their radical ideas posed a threat to the interests of the United States.Hodges admits that Marilyn Monroe was the only woman he had ever assassinated, a unique target at the time. He claims she had become a significant “threat to the security of the country” and had to be eliminated.“We had evidence that Marilyn Monroe had not only slept with Kennedy but also with Fidel Castro”, says M.

He claimed it was done as a favor to senior Iranian officials linked to President Hassan Rouhani, and he alleged the move sparked a competition among Iranian officials over whose children would benefit from the scheme.Several children of current and former Iranian officials live in the United States, including Ali Fereydoun, whose father is brother and special aide of President Hassan Rouhan, and Fatemeh Ardeshir Larijani, whose father Ali Larijani is speaker of parliament.While Zolnour did not mention any names, he obviously was trying to make a political point.“When Obama, during the negotiations about the JCPOA, decided to do a favor to these men, he granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians and some officials started a competition over whose children could be part of these 2,500 Iranians,” he claimed. “If today these Iranians get deported from America, it will become clear who is complicit and sells the national interest like he is selling candies to America.” The conservative Zolnour, who is in Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s inner circle, added: “It should be stated exactly which children of which authorities live in the United States and have received citizenship or residency.”He said while some were studying in the U.S. others were working in the U.S. “against our national interests.”It’s not clear who he’s talking about and whether he’s confusing a green card with citizenship. And one has to take his political objective into account.But it obviously raises a concerning question.There have been so many things hidden from the public about the Iran Deal if this was one more thing given up in bribe, it wouldn’t be hard to believe.And it shouldn’t be hard to track this down with a little government and Congressional investigation.The problem, of course, too many Obama holdovers in places like the State Department so you can’t get a straight answer.Asked about the cleric’s claim, a State Department spokesperson said: “We’re not going to comment on every statement by an Iranian official.” Fox News analyst and former Obama State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf was dubious of the Iranian official’s allegation. “This sounds like totally made up BS,” she said.

Jennings and two other officers chased Thompson down the stairs which is where the foul odor had gotten stronger. When the officers got to the basement, they found a series of freezers scattered around the basement. With no trace of Thompson, one officer continued to search for him as the other two pried opened three locked deep freezers. Upon their discovery, 11 decapitated bodies were found frozen, while the heads where in ziplock freezer bags. All of the bodies appeared to have been Caucasian women, possibly in their early to mid-20’s. The heads that were found all had the words “Black Lives Matter” carved into the foreheads. The bodies were were preserved, possibly from being stored in the deep freezers.The police radioed for back up and the other freezers were opened where 8 more bodies in similar condition were found, however one of the women was still alive. Authorities at the scene helped the woman out of the freezer and waited for paramedics to arrive.“I was kidnapped by this Black guy after I left work earlier today. We talked for while at Starbucks, where I work, before everything happened. At first he seemed pretty nice but he had this weird twitch that happened every couple of minutes. He asked if he could walk me to my car and I said yes, but that is when everything went dark. When I woke up, I was in this basement and I saw that guy I was with earlier taking saws up the stairs. I cried for help and that is when he stuffed me into a freezer where I saw dead bodies. I must have passed out from shock or something but I am happy you guys found me,” said to police by the victim.Officer Douglas, who was searching for Thompson, found him in a crawl space in the basement. Police ran a background check on him and discovered that he was arrested","Rasheed Thompson, a 39-year-old man from Chicago, was taken into custody after being linked to a number of dead bodies that had been discovered in a freezer located in his basement, all of which had the words ""Black Lives Matter"" etched onto the bodies' foreheads. The coroners office was alerted to the suspicious activity by multiple 911 calls from neighbours, and upon arriving at the scene, the authorities were greeted by local residents who helped them locate the specific residence in question. Officials noted that the home reeked of a horrid odour associated with death, and that, upon gaining entry, they discovered several saws that were covered in blood in the kitchen alongside a gasoline-powered generator. Officers engaged in a heated pursuit with Thompson, and upon discovering a row of freezers in the basement, opened them to reveal eleven decapitated bodies belonging to Caucasian women who appeared to be in their mid-20s to early 30s. All the heads from these women were found separately, in ziplock freezer bags, where they bore the same phrase of ""Black Lives Matter"". The police then requested backup and successfully opened more freezers in the basement, wherein they found another eight bodies in similar states of preservation. However, they also found one of the women inside the freezers to still be alive. Police escorted her out of the freezer and waited for medical assistance. In speaking with officers, the victim stated that she had been abducted by Thompson while leaving her place of work, Starbucks, earlier that day, and that she had encountered him there. According to her, although Thompson had seemed affable at first, he had quickly shown a bizarre and jerky movement habit. Thompson then offered to walk her to her car and, upon doing so, seemingly knocked her unconscious. The police finally found Thompson in a crawlspace in the basement, and while he was taken into custody, a background check revealed previously unrelated convictions.",paraphrase_generation

According to recent reports from Russian news, it appears that the Obama Administration's alleged punishment of Russia for interfering in the 2016 Presidential election was not what it claimed to be. In reality, the motive was to acquire mansions for his daughters at no cost while pleasing his ignorant liberal supporters. Furthermore, the administration also imposed sanctions on Russian intelligence agencies and forced 35 government officials to exit the country within 72 hours, all in an attempt to make the act of acquiring the mansions appear legitimate. Nevertheless, this was simply a power play done in an effort to gain as much free property as possible before the administration's departure.

This information was uncovered by Gateway Pundit’s Charles C. Johnson, who notes in his report that “Dourif is paid extremely well according to public documents, which report a $250,783.33 annual salary for Dourif.”“Why would Barack and Michelle Obama’s housekeeper suddenly remember that she was molested by someone who is running for public office – someone of the opposing party,” Johnson writes. “This stinks more than Malia Obama’s dorm room after one of her reefer parties.”What exactly is going on? Ever since it her employer was revealed, Dourif has gone dark, removing all of her social media presences and refusing to respond to interview requests from any source.","Liberals are afraid of Roy Moore. They had a woman make false allegations against him from 35 years ago, and when that didn't work, they introduced a new actress who claimed he molested her in 1957. However, it was discovered that the actress is currently employed as a housekeeper for Michelle Obama, and there are questions about her motives and why she suddenly remembered the alleged abuse. She has since gone into hiding and won't respond to interview requests.",paraphrase_generation
politifact15123,"EspañolThe current influenza season has been especially difficult, causing widespread illness that has affected all fifty states and resulted in a record number of hospitalizations. While healthcare professionals continue to combat this year’s flu – which may continue to affect Americans into April – we’re already partnering with other public health agencies to conduct essential work to produce next season’s influenza vaccines.As part of this process, we’re striving to better understand why we saw reduced effectiveness of this year’s influenza vaccines against one strain of influenza A, called H3N2. It was this strain that caused much of the influenza-related illness this flu season. Moreover, this year is not the first time we have seen vaccines be less effective against this particular strain of influenza, H3N2.As such, we are taking a number of actions to better understand why effectiveness tends to be lower against the H3N2 strain and what we can do about it. By looking closely at the available data and applying the lessons we learn each flu season to the vaccine development process, we offer the greatest chance of developing vaccines that even more effectively prevent the flu in the future.These lessons may be applied not only to enhancing the most prevalent process for developing influenza vaccine in eggs, but to considering whether greater investment in alternative processes such as cell-based or recombinant approaches to vaccine development are required. With this statement, I want to outline what we’ve learned so far about this season’s vaccines and the steps we’re taking and plan to take to determine the root cause of this year’s findings and better prepare for future flu seasons.Reduced effectiveness of 2017-2018 seasonal vaccines against H3N2There are a number of theories on why this season’s vaccines produced reduced effectiveness against H3N2. We’re taking steps to investigate each of these potential causes, rule out possible reasons for the variation in effectiveness and improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Overall, preliminary vaccine effectiveness reported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for H3N2 influenza was 25 percent, which means that people who received the vaccine were 25 percent less likely to be sick and need to see a doctor.While that finding isn’t too far off from the vaccine effectiveness seen against H3N2 in previous years, we need to take new steps to improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Of note, the effectiveness of the vaccine against H3N2 in children 6 months to 8 years of age was 51 percent this season, yet the effectiveness in those 65 years and older was only 17 percent, and the effectiveness in older children and adults under 65 years of age was even lower. The vaccines did do much better for other viruses that are also causing the flu this season. The data show that overall vaccine effectiveness for H1N1 and influenza B was 67 percent and 42 percent, respectively, for all age groups combined.So why did this season’s vaccines not deliver higher protection against H3N2? And why have vaccines in prior seasons when H3N2 circulated, also delivered reduced protection against this particular flu strain?We don’t think it was a question of getting the particular H3N2 strain wrong when we set out to produce this season’s flu vaccines. Although adapting circulating virus strains for manufacture can lead to differences between the circulating strain and the one used for manufacturing that could affect effectiveness, so far the data we have suggests that the viruses provided by reference laboratories to manufacturers to make this year’s vaccines do reasonably match the circulating flu strains that are causing most of the illnesses, including H3N2.However, we’re working with our colleagues at CDC and other federal agencies to examine and address other factors that might be contributing to the less than optimal overall protection provided by this season’s vaccines against influenz",1,en,"EspañolThe current influenza season has been especially difficult, causing widespread illness that has affected all fifty states and resulted in a record number of hospitalizations.

We would particularly like to understand why vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 influenza year-to-year tends to be lower than effectiveness against other influenza viruses.Working to determine the root causesToward these ends, scientists at FDA are collaborating with colleagues at Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to use a large database that includes details of the flu vaccines administered to four million individuals along with whether they were hospitalized for influenza or treated with antiviral medications for influenza-like illness. This work, which is still underway, will try to better understand why overall effectiveness with both the cell-based and egg-based vaccines was less than optimal. We’re also looking at the difference in effectiveness in people 65 years and older who were vaccinated with high-dose influenza vaccine and adjuvanted influenza vaccine to see if effectiveness was better than in those vaccinated with standard dose vaccines. The adjuvanted influenza vaccine contains an ingredient meant to boost the immune system’s response to the vaccine while high dose vaccines contain four times as much of the influenza material or antigen as standard vaccines. What we learn about the differences in efficacy between these different vaccines might reveal information that can inform why overall effectiveness against H3N2 was lagging.What might this information reveal? One theory is that people might require a higher amount of H3N2 antigen to elicit a proper immune response to that particular strain of influenza. As I noted previously, the work conducted with CMS shows a preliminary finding that suggests the cell-based influenza vaccine might be somewhat more effective than the egg-based vaccine. We are working to follow up on that finding. We’re also combing through the data to see if there are other reasons for why this season’s vaccines were less effective against H3N2. Our scientists are currently working internally and collaborating with others inside and outside of the federal government to understand all of these findings.The knowledge we gain through such scientific research will allow us to determine if we need to change recommendations to vaccine manufacturers for how future season’s vaccines should be produced.Looking ahead to the 2018-2019 flu seasonWhile this scientific work is underway, the composition of next season’s flu vaccines will be the subject of an FDA advisory committee","The current flu season has been tough on the US, affecting all states resulting in a record number of hospitalizations. The healthcare professionals are trying to combat this season's flu while planning for next season's influenza vaccines. The vaccines this season have been less effective against one strain of influenza A, called H3N2, which caused much of the illness. To combat this, various steps are being taken to understand the reasons behind the reduced effectiveness. The effectiveness of the vaccine against H3N2 in children was 51 percent while it was only 17 percent for those above 65 years of age. The vaccines did better against other viruses causing the flu. Researchers are examining various causes for the lower effectiveness of the vaccine, apart from the virus strain, and are working to understand why vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 is generally low.

During this same week last year, CNN averaged 1.191 million. That is a -29 percent collapse.CNN’s average total day viewers disintegrated by -25 percent, 841K compared to 635K.In other words, throughout the day last week, CNN could only attract an average of 635,000 total viewers.Fox News, however, is thriving. Last week, Fox averaged 2.487 million primetime viewers, nearly three times that of CNN’s 844K, and 1.463 million total day viewers, more than twice CNN’s 635K.While MSNBC is in a distant second place behind Fox, it is still leaving CNN in the dust with an average of 1.667 million primetime viewers and 913K total day viewers.Incredibly, CNN’s second week of May this year was even worse than the first week, which was already catastrophic. During week one, CNN attracted a dismal 859K primetime viewers, but that was still better than week two, which dropped even further to 844K. In total day viewers, the anti-Trump channel dipped from a ruinous week one of just 649K viewers to an even more ruinous week two of 635K.Compared to the full month of May last year, the Stormy Daniels Network is collapsing even more in the advertiser-coveted 25-54 age demo.During the full month of May 2017, CNN average 399K demo viewers during primetime. Last week that number collapsed a whopping -35 percent to just 259K. In total day, the damage was -34 percent, from 274K demo viewers to a humiliating 183K.By comparison, Fox News averaged 492K demo viewers during primetime (almost double CNN) and 296K demo viewers during the total day.MSNBC averaged 326K demo viewers during primetime and 190K during total day.The third week of May is already looking like it could be even worse for CNN. On Monday, despite the massive news surrounding the opening of the American embassy in Jerusalem, CNN averaged a dismal 643K total day viewers, compared to Fox and MSNBC’s 1.76 million and 1.13 million, respectively.During primetime Monday, CNN could only attract a scant 765K total viewers. Fox nearly quadrupled CNN with 2.89 million viewers. MSNBC more than doubled CNN with 1.93 million.The bottom line is that CNN’s ongoing and well-documented credibility crisis has now come home to roost as a five-alarm ratings crisis.",1,en,"CNN is on the verge of permanently closing its doors after its ratings collapsed even more than last week, falling a staggering 30 percent in the second week of May.While Fox News increased its total viewers by a healthy 6 percent and MSNBC held steady, CNN’s viewership took a nosedive, signalling that the failing news network may be about to come to an abrupt end.Breitbart.com reports: While no one in the media want to talk about it, CNN’s relentless fake news sprees have not only created a massive credibility problem for the hate network, the far-left cable channel’s ratings crisis is even more severe.CNN lies.Numbers do not…Last week, during the all-important primetime hours, CNN was only able to average 844K total viewers. During this same week last year, CNN averaged 1.191 million. That is a -29 percent collapse.CNN’s average total day viewers disintegrated by -25 percent, 841K compared to 635K.In other words, throughout the day last week, CNN could only attract an average of 635,000 total viewers.Fox News, however, is thriving. Last week, Fox averaged 2.487 million primetime viewers, nearly three times that of CNN’s 844K, and 1.463 million total day viewers, more than twice CNN’s 635K.While MSNBC is in a distant second place behind Fox, it is still leaving CNN in the dust with an average of 1.667 million primetime viewers and 913K total day viewers.Incredibly, CNN’s second week of May this year was even worse than the first week, which was already catastrophic. During week one, CNN attracted a dismal 859K primetime viewers, but that was still better than week two, which dropped even further to 844K. In total day viewers, the anti-Trump channel dipped from a ruinous week one of just 649K viewers to an even more ruinous week two of 635K.Compared to the full month of May last year, the Stormy Daniels Network is collapsing even more in the advertiser-coveted 25-54 age demo.During the full month of May 2017, CNN average 399K demo viewers during primetime. Last week that number collapsed a whopping -35 percent to just 259K. In total day, the damage was -34 percent, from 274K demo viewers to a humiliating 183K.By comparison, Fox News averaged 492K demo viewers during primetime (almost double CNN) and 296K demo viewers during the total day.MSNBC averaged 326K demo viewers during primetime and 190K during total day.The third week of May is already looking like it could be even worse for CNN.

Fox nearly quadrupled CNN with 2.89 million viewers. MSNBC more than doubled CNN with 1.93 million.The bottom line is that CNN’s ongoing and well-documented credibility crisis has now come home to roost as a five-alarm ratings crisis.","CNN is facing closure due to a significant drop in their ratings, with a 30% decline in the second week of May. Fox News and MSNBC, on the other hand, have seen an increase in viewership. The decline in CNN's ratings can be attributed to their reputation for spreading fake news and a lack of credibility. Last year's viewership was much higher compared to this year's numbers, with a -29% drop in total evening viewers and a -25% drop in total day viewers. In contrast, Fox News is thriving with three times the viewership during prime time and more than twice the viewership during the day. MSNBC also surpassed CNN in viewership. The decline is most significant in the 25-54 age group, with a -35% decline in viewership during prime time. This trend seems to continue in the third week of May, with CNN viewership dropping even further, while Fox News and MSNBC viewership remain stable. CNN's lack of credibility is the root cause of their 5-alarm ratings crisis.",paraphrase_generation
politifact13942,"The government has implemented a new regulation requiring a governor to be placed on all motorcycles by mid-January 2017. The purpose of the mandatory governor would be to prevent motorcyclists from exceeding a speed of 75- miles per hour. The regulation aims to drastically reduce the amount of annual motorcycle fatalities in the United States.Many are not surprised by the regulation as politicians have been asking for stricter safety features to be implemented on motorcycles for the past several decades. In 2014, the government offered all major motorcycle manufactures including Harley-Davidson, Yamaha, Honda, Ducati, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and BMW a large tax-incentive to begin implementing governors on all newly manufactured motorcycles, however to much surprise, all relevant manufactures declined to take advantage of the additional tax-incentive, requiring government officials to return to the drawing board.Members of the U.S. Department of Transportation or U.D.O.T were supportive of the regulation and heavily involved in its roll-out. According to U.S. Department of Transportation representative James Littleton, the motorcycle governor regulation was long past due and made a comparison to the governors placed on traditional automobiles. Littleton told reporters during a press-conference that each year approximately 8,265 motorcycle fatalities occur throughout the United States. According to Littleton, the vast majority (approximately 73%) of motorcycle fatalities are the result of motorcyclists driving at unsafe speeds.When asked why the regulation would only allow motorcyclists to maintain a speed below 75-miles per hour, Littleton made the following comment to reporters, “This is a crucial safety regulation that should have been implemented at least 20-years ago, now that we are finally implementing it, we want to ensure we do it right. With the exception of a few states that allow for 80-miles per mile freeway driving (Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) and Texas who allows for speeds of up to 85-miles per hour on the freeway, most states allow a maximum speed of 75-miles per hour. We wanted to make it easy for motorcyclists in most all states to easily obey their respective posted speed limit.”According to Littleton, motorcyclists in the few states that periodically allow for speeds exceeding 75-miles per hour, governors allowing speeds up to 80-85-miles per hour may eventually be implemented, however in the meantime, police officials in these states have been given direction to avoid citing motorcyclists for such infractions as obstructing the flow of traffic when relevant.Officials expect all motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures to be in compliance with the new regulation by mid to late January 2017, however may file for a temporary 30, 60, or 90-day extension under select circumstances. According to Littleton, citations and fines will be imposed on both motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures who fail to remain in compliance with the regulation.According to Littleton, designated motorcycle mechanic and auto-body shops in each state will be permitted to install the mandatory governors on motorcycles manufactured and sold prior to the implementation of the regulation at a subsidized rate. Littleton did not have details regarding the government subsidized repair readily available, however told reporters that he expects the subsidized cost to be around $35 to the consumer.Littleton concluded the press conference by informing reporters that the U.S Department of Transportation is currently working diligently to release all relevant information pertaining to the new regulation on the U.D.O.T website.",1,en,"The government has implemented a new regulation requiring a governor to be placed on all motorcycles by mid-January 2017.

Major motorcycle manufacturers were offered a large tax break by the government in 2014 to fit governors on all new motorcycles, but they declined.

The cause of the explosion is unknown, but foul play is not suspected. Paladino was a school nurse who had helped create a document requiring schools to purchase epinephrine auto-injectors (EpiPens) without parental permission, leading to a monopoly by Mylan N.V., maker of EpiPens, in school nurses' offices throughout the US.

However, this is not a case of voter fraud, as some have suggested. The State Board of Elections attributes this to the fact that prior to 1993, the state did not require voters to provide their birth dates when registering to vote. Therefore, some voters who registered before this time were assigned a default birth date of 01/01/1900, resulting in inflated figures of centenarian voters.

Hillary might have lost the election, but Soros is still out there, mobilizing and planning more moves that seek to dismantle the Donald Trump presidency.That’s why Trump finally had enough and is going to charge Soros as a “threat to national security” in the United States. Considering that this is the same man that has mobilized and paid protesters to create a tremendous amount of damage, it’s been a long time coming for this order.Trump had placed a call to Russia to ask about “any and all” files that are related to Soros. He was able to do this thanks to the 2014 Executive Order that was signed by President Obama, entitled “Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine.”“I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that the actions and policies of persons that undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.”Nearly a month after this order was signed US diplomatic cables show that Soros did “undermine the processes and institutions in Ukraine.” Due to Soros’s illegal intervention into a peaceful transition of power, mass conflict erupted and an estimated 9,600 men, women, and children lost their lives.Clearly that is interfering in the process. So why didn’t President Obama charge Soros as a threat to the United States national security? It’s because Soros flooded Obama and Hillary’s Democratic Party with about $100 million in donations. You really think that Obama is going to charge someone that has donated that much to their party?Soros began his takeover back in 2004, as he declared “it is the central focus of my life” and “a matter of life and death” to push his influence on the American people and our democracy. While 2004 failed, Soros had turned to 2016 and had become Hillary’s highest donor. We know that Hillary listens to people that donate to her, so she would have been listening to Soros the entire time.Now that the Democratic Party has been completely defeated, Soros is doing what he can to go against President Trump, saying “democracy is now in crisis.” Soros has been active in his fight against Trump, as he was discovered to have been the mastermind behind paying protesters to cause as much damage and destruction as possible.During the election season, there were several Black Lives Matter protests that quickly turned violent.

The city’s decision in February to remove the statue drew earlier protests by the “alt-right” and the Ku Klux Klan.Riot police cleared the park after almost an hour of clashes. The far-right groups were largely compliant, but had to run the gauntlet of counter-protesters as they walked west along Market Street.After a brief stalemate, a hard core of about 100 far-right protesters moved to a park two miles away and gathered to hear speakers who had been scheduled for the “Unite the Right” event.One of the speakers, the far-right figurehead Richard Spencer, said he had been maced on the way in and lashed out at police and city authorities.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Rescue personnel help injured people after a car ran into a large group. Photograph: Steve Helber/AP“Never in my life have I felt like the government was cracking down on me until today,” said Spencer. “We came in peace and we were effectively thrown to the wolves.”He said that they would not back down from protesting against the statue. When he mentioned Mayor Signer by name, the crowd chanted: “Jew! Jew! Jew!”Around the park, members of the far right were nursing and treating minor wounds. One of them, who declined to give his name, was bleeding from the head, and claimed to have been struck with an iron bar. Another young man, with a swastika tattoo on his chest and blood on his forehead, told photographers: “If you take my picture, I’ll cut you. I’m not even kidding.”Meanwhile, counter-protesters were trying to stop the far-right groups from entering the park. Some counter-protesters, including many marching under red and black anti-fascist banners, tried to block the streets. This led to altercations with far-right groups, who were seen using chemical weapons, sticks and shields on people.A group of clergy linked arms to block a set of stairs leading into the park. The Rev Seth Wispelwey, of Sojourners United Church of Christ in Charlottesville, said:","A man from Ohio named James Fields has been arrested and charged with murder after he drove a car into a group of people who were protesting against a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Here in America, we do not pay obeisance to the powerful – in fact, we question the powerful most ardently – to do so is our birthright and a requirement of our citizenship -- and so, we know well that no matter how powerful, no president will ever have dominion over objective reality.No politician will ever get to tell us what the truth is and is not. And anyone who presumes to try to attack or manipulate the truth to his own purposes should be made to realize the mistake and be held to account. That is our job here. And that is just as Madison, Hamilton, and Jay would have it.Of course, a major difference between politicians and the free press is that the press usually corrects itself when it gets something wrong. Politicians don’t.No longer can we compound attacks on truth with our silent acquiescence. No longer can we turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to these assaults on our institutions. And Mr. President, an American president who cannot take criticism – who must constantly deflect and distort and distract – who must find someone else to blame -- is charting a very dangerous path. And a Congress that fails to act as a check on the president adds to the danger.Now, we are told via twitter that today the president intends to announce his choice for the “most corrupt and dishonest” media awards. It beggars belief that an American president would engage in such a spectacle. But here we are.And so, 2018 must be the year in which the truth takes a stand against power that would weaken it. In this effort, the choice is quite simple. And in this effort, the truth needs as many allies as possible. Together, my colleagues, we are powerful. Together, we have it within us to turn back these attacks, right these wrongs, repair this damage, restore reverence for our institutions, and prevent further moral vandalism.Together, united in the","Senator Jeff Flake delivered a speech to the Senate on January 17, 2018, in which he talked about the importance of truth and its relationship to democracy. He highlighted that the past year saw the truth being battered and abused by the most powerful figure in our government, resulting in the phrase “alternative facts” being enshrined into the American lexicon. He noted that the free press is the despot’s enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy, and that no politician will ever get to tell us what the truth is and is not. The senator urged for a united effort in standing up for the truth against power that would weaken it.",paraphrase_generation
