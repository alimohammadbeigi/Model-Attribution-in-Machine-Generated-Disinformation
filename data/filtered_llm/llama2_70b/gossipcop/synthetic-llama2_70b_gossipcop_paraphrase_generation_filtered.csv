The son of an Army major, Strahan grew up in Germany and did not play competitive high school football until his senior year when his parents sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in Texas.  The former defensive end played well enough to earn a scholarship to Texas Southern University. By his senior year of college, he had set a record for sacks, which got the attention of the NFL.  In 1993, the New York Giants drafted Strahan as the 40th overall draft pick. Over the next 14 seasons, he became the league’s all-time quarterback sack leader, played in the Pro Bowl and helped the Giants defeat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII.  Upon retiring in 2008, Strahan concentrated on his off-field talents. In 2012, he became Kelly Ripa’s “Live! With Kelly” co-host, replacing longtime host Regis Philbin. Four years later, he left the show and joined ABC’s “Good Morning America”; it took more than a year for “Live” to announce Ryan Seacrest as its new co-host.

gossipcop-7392274516,1,"They both looked so happy, and so relaxed. They were beaming as they said their vows, and luckily, no one came forward to provide any reason that they might not be married. (This is always an exciting moment in a ceremony.) It was an extraordinary mix of tradition and modernity, of centuries of history and up-to-the moment flourishes. Oprah was here, and so was Meghan’s mother, an African-American social worker who wore a conventional mother-of-the-bride outfit and also a nose stud. It somehow looked charming and just right. The entire royal family was here, along with a complement of English aristocrats and important personages. The music was stately and beautiful. The setting was awe-inspiring. There was a flotilla of clergymen, an extraordinary mélange including the archbishop of Canterbury and — in a striking inclusion in this most ancient of places — the head of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Curry. Chosen to give the address to the congregations, Bishop Curry, who is African-American, quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His voice rising and falling with emotion, he made a big, generous, impassioned case for love as the most important thing there is, in religion and in life. His address came after a reading by Lady Jane Fellowes, Harry’s aunt (her sister was Diana, Princess of Wales) that was both full of joy and a signal, it seemed, that the sadness in Harry’s life since his mother’s death had finally lifted. It was a passage from the Song of Solomon: “Arise my love, my fair one, and come away; for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The dress was a success: sculptural simplicity. Photo Our fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, is also watching, and she has a quick take for us on Meghan Markle’s dress. It was absolutely simple: pure and sculptural, in double bonded silk cady with a wide boatneck, long sleeves and sweeping train. It was Meghan Markle’s wedding dress. It was by Clare Waight Keller, a British woman and the first female designer of Givenchy. And it was everything people had hoped. This was not a Cinderella choice, not one that spoke of fantasy or old-fashioned fairy tales. Instead, it placed the woman proudly front and center and underscored Ms. Markle’s own independence. At the same time, it celebrated female strength, promoted a local designer and reached a hand across to Europe (where Ms. Waight Keller has a day job). The five-meter veil was of silk tulle, with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads and organza, and contained embroidery representing the flora of all 53 Commonwealth nations. Video And it was entirely a surprise. In all the rumors that had swirled around The Dress, from Ralph & Russo to Stella McCartney, Ms. Waight Keller’s name had never come up. In the end, Ms. Markle outthought us all. As this starts, long may it continue. And the After-Party Dress The newly minted Duke and Duchess of Sussex departed Windsor for their evening reception at Frogmore House in a very James Bond fashion. The duchess wore a second dress by designer Stella McCartney. You can read our fashion critic Vanessa Friedman’s reaction here.

Photo Unlike a lot of weddings — and certainly unlike Kate and William’s wedding, just seven years ago — the guests inside hung out in the aisles, air-kissing and gossiping. It’s a great royal-and-celebrity cocktail party! (Sadly without cocktails.) Kate and William’s wedding was solemn, stately, stuffy, full of dignitaries, politicians, and the sort of boring personages known here as the great and the good. But this looked totally fun for the guests — even more fun than, say, the Academy Awards — because no one was competing for anything and no one was forced to talk about their outfits to television reporters. Part of the change in tone is down to the passage of time and to how much Britain, or perhaps the royal family, has changed in the last few years. Another reason, of course, is that Harry, being the second son and not a future king, has the freedom to be more relaxed, less constrained by tradition, and less conventional than his brother. This wedding has nothing to do with dynasty, or ensuring the security of the royal line. (We hope they have kids! But only because it’s fun to have kids, not because it would be some sort of international crisis if they did not.) This wedding had everything to do with two people who are totally into each other and wanted to have a great big happy celebration. Oprah, Beckhams and Clooneys, oh my! Photo One of the great excitements about any wedding, of course, is the moment you learn who has been invited and who has not. Meghan and Harry’s list was kept secret, until the very moment that dozens of mysterious figures started to enter St. George’s Chapel. It was very exciting. There was none other than Oprah Winfrey, in a snug pink dress, a pair of very cool sunglasses and a massive broad-brimmed hat spectacularly festooned with flowers. If anyone qualifies as American royalty, it is surely Oprah, with her ability to transcend race and background, and her great gift for openness and emotional candor.

The journalist has paraphrased the given passage by using different words and phrasing to convey the same meaning. Here's a summary of the paraphrased passage:
The couple looked delighted and relaxed during their wedding ceremony. No one objected to their marriage, and the ceremony was a mix of tradition and modern touches. The event was attended by many famous people, including Oprah Winfrey, the Clooneys, and the Beckhams. The bride's mother was also present, wearing a conventional mother-of-the-bride outfit and a nose stud. The music and setting were beautiful, and the ceremony included a message about the importance of love. The bride's dress was simple yet elegant, designed by a British woman who was the first female designer of Givenchy. The couple's love and happiness were the focus of the celebration, which was a departure from more formal and traditional royal weddings.",paraphrase_generation

She’s Had Relationships With Several Male Celebrities Lovato, like most notable celebrities, have dated other people in the industry. According to Pop Sugar, she dated The Cab frontman Alex DeLeon from 2008-09, and later based the breakup song “Catch Me” on him. Lovato also had brief flings with Trace Cyrus (Miley’s older brother) in 2009 and Joe Jonas, her self-proclaimed “BFF,” in 2010. Her most notable relationship to date, however, has been with Valderrama, whom she dated from from 2010 to 2016. In an interview with Latina magazine, Lovato discussed what attracted her to the That 70’s Show actor: When I dated white guys, it wasn’t as passionate as my relationship with Wilmer. Maybe that’s just Wilmer. But I do believe that Latin people are just more expressive, more passionate with their emotions. He’s very manly, and he can be stubborn like Latino men can, but he’s protective and he cares so much and loves so hard. I’ve been blessed enough to have him in my life, and not just as my man, but also my best friend. Since her breakup from Valderrama, Lovato’s been seen with MMA fighter Guilherme “Bomba” Vasconcelos and Abedini. 3. Ruby Rose Claims that She & Lovato ‘Hooked Up’ in 2013 In 2013, model and actress Ruby Rose turned heads when she tweeted that she had a lesbian tryst with Lovato. “I’m like the one person demi has slept with that didn’t sell on naked photos of her so eff off,” Rose tweeted out. She went on to say “Think ill take a few days off social media whilst @ddlovato’s friends attack me for being a ‘scorned ex-lover’ get over it! I liked the hair.” Furthermore, a source for Life & Style said that Rose and Lovato dated for two years while the singer took a break from her relationship with Valderrama. A post shared by Ruby Rose (@rubyrose) on Aug 13, 2017 at 1:32pm PDT Lovato addressed these claims in a 2015 interview with Complex magazine. “Rumours are rumours, and people are going to spread them,” she said. “You can believe what you want, but no, I was not in a relationship with her. By the way, love is fluid.” The singer added “Whether there’s been rumours with one specific person or not, that’s all that matters. Humans are humans, and when you connect with somebody on a spiritual level it doesn’t matter. I don’t want people to ever look at the past or rumours or anything and try to figure me out.” 4. She Won the GLAAD Vanguard Award for Promoting LGBTQ Equality While Lovato may be keeping her personal life under wraps, she has made no effort to hide her support for the LGBTQ community. The singer has been so supportive, in fact, that she was given the GLAAD Vanguard Award in 2016, which, according to the GLAAD website, is “presented to media professionals who have made a significant difference in promoting equality and acceptance.” The award was given to her by close friend and former Camp Rock co-star Nick Jonas. “Demi Lovato has consistently used her platform as a successful artist to send messages of acceptance and support to LGBT people everywhere,” said GLAAD President & CEO Sarah Kate Ellis. “She is an extraordinary ally who is committed to helping young people embrace who they are and live the lives they love.” During her acceptance speech, Lovato said “You should always love yourself for who you are,” she said. “The skin that you are in, whether you identify with it and are afraid to tell people, just go for it.

The singer has been so supportive, in fact, that she was given the GLAAD Vanguard Award in 2016, which, according to the GLAAD website, is “presented to media professionals who have made a significant difference in promoting equality and acceptance.” The award was given to her by close friend and former Camp Rock co-star Nick Jonas. “Demi Lovato has consistently used her platform as a successful artist to send messages of acceptance and support to LGBT people everywhere,” said GLAAD President & CEO Sarah Kate Ellis. “She is an extraordinary ally who is committed to helping young people embrace who they are and live the lives they love.” During her acceptance speech, Lovato said “You should always love yourself for who you are,” she said. “The skin that you are in, whether you identify with it and are afraid to tell people, just go for it. You can do it!” Watch the full speech above. 5. She Said She’s Not ‘Denying’ or ‘Confirming’ Her Sexuality Lovato’s 2015 single “Cool for the Summer” had many fans wondering whether or not this was her coy way of speaking on her sexuality. The lyrics “Tell me what you want, what you like, it’s ok / I’m a little curious, too” and “Got a taste for the cherry / I just need","to take a bite” are commonly interpreted as bisexual. When asked about the song’s meaning by Hits 97.3 in an interview, Lovato replied “I’m not confirming, and I’m definitely not denying.” She went on to say “All of my songs are based off of personal experiences. You can interpret them as you want. I’m not one to label myself. I just like to do what feels right.” When it comes to Lovato’s love life, fans should focus on what she’s said herself: that love is fluid and we should love whoever we want. Whether or not Lovato confirms her relationship with Abedini, one thing is for sure– we will always support her and her choices.",paraphrase_generation

gossipcop-6803836615,1,"What do Katy Perry, Meryl Streep, Anderson Cooper and Chelsea Clinton have in common? They have all eaten human flesh at LA’s notorious cannibal restaurant, Cannibal Club.  The private restaurant has long operated under the radar in Los Angeles, with rumors circulating about who has attended and what is really served behind closed doors. Now a leaked Cannibal Club document has exposed some of the notorious restaurant’s “elite” patrons.  CANNIBALISM ‘MORE POPULAR THAN YOU MIGHT THINK’  Meryl Streep, Chelsea Clinton and CNN’s Anderson Cooper all hold Cannibal Club membership, according to the document. Katy Perry, who has previously said that “Cannibalism is way more popular than you might think” and “human flesh is the best meat“, is also a regular diner.  Boasting that the restaurant is the “cutting edge of experimental cuisine” and serves “L.A.’s cultural elite“, the Cannibal Club website makes clear they “specialize in the preparation of human meat” that comes from “young and healthy bodies.“  Cannibal Club’s visiting chefs “hail from around the world” and come to L.A. to “practice their craft free of compromise and unbounded by convention,” according to the Cannibal Club website.  ‘FILMMAKERS, INTELLECTUALS, AND CELEBRITIES’  “Our exclusive clientele includes noted filmmakers, intellectuals, and celebrities who have embraced the Enlightenment ideals of free expression and rationalism. On event nights, avant-garde performance artists, celebrated literary figures, and ground-breaking musicians entertain our guests.  “At Cannibal Club, we celebrate artistic excellence as the natural and inevitable expression of the unbridled human spirit.“  Describing each dish as a “study in taste and elegance“, Chef de Cuisine Sophie Laffite explains: “The meat we serve is selected from the young and healthy. Consistent with the practice of cannibalism in many primitive societies, we view anthropophagy as homage to the dead, who are reborn into the bodies of their consumers.”  But don’t think you can just walk in there and check the place out. The private restaurant operates a strict vetting policy, according to the website:  “It is necessary for us to operate privately and to vette our members in order to avoid disruption from the less enlightened.“  HUMAN MEAT MENU  The current menu listed on the site includes Sirloin Steak (human meat, flame-broiled 8oz), Liver and Mushroom Pirozhi (“a Russian version of pierogies, baked rather than boiled, with a savory filling of wild mushrooms and human liver“) and Placenta Lasagne (“an otherwise traditional lasagna with one layer of cheese substituted by minced placenta in heirloom tomato sauce, seasoned with garlic, onion and oregano”.)

They have all eaten human flesh at LA’s notorious cannibal restaurant, Cannibal Club.  The private restaurant has long operated under the radar in Los Angeles, with rumors circulating about who has attended and what is really served behind closed doors. Now a leaked Cannibal Club document has exposed some of the notorious restaurant’s “elite” patrons.  CANNIBALISM ‘MORE POPULAR THAN YOU MIGHT THINK’  Meryl Streep, Chelsea Clinton and CNN’s Anderson Cooper all hold Cannibal Club membership, according to the document. Katy Perry, who has previously said that “Cannibalism is way more popular than you might think” and “human flesh is the best meat“, is also a regular diner.  Boasting that the restaurant is the “cutting edge of experimental cuisine” and serves “L.A.’s cultural elite“, the Cannibal Club website makes clear they “specialize in the preparation of human meat” that comes from “young and healthy bodies.“  Cannibal Club’s visiting chefs “hail from around the world” and come to L.A. to “practice their craft free of compromise and unbounded by convention,” according to the Cannibal Club website.  ‘FILMMAKERS, INTELLECTUALS, AND CELEBRITIES’  “Our exclusive clientele includes noted filmmakers, intellectuals, and celebrities who have embraced the Enlightenment ideals of free expression and rationalism. On event nights, avant-garde performance artists, celebrated literary figures, and ground-breaking musicians entertain our guests.  “At Cannibal Club, we celebrate artistic excellence as the natural and inevitable expression of the unbridled human spirit.“  Describing each dish as a “study in taste and elegance“, Chef de Cuisine Sophie Laffite explains: “The meat we serve is selected from the young and healthy. Consistent with the practice of cannibalism in many primitive societies, we view anthropophagy as homage to the dead, who are reborn into the bodies of their consumers.”  But don’t think you can just walk in there and check the place out. The private restaurant operates a strict vetting policy, according to the website:  “It is necessary for us to operate privately and to vette our members in order to avoid disruption from the less enlightened.“  HUMAN MEAT MENU  The current menu listed on the site includes Sirloin Steak (human meat, flame-broiled 8oz), Liver and Mushroom Pirozhi (“a Russian version of pierogies, baked rather than boiled, with a savory filling of wild mushrooms and human liver“) and Placenta Lasagne (“an otherwise traditional lasagna with one layer of cheese substituted by minced placenta in heirloom tomato sauce, seasoned with garlic, onion and oregano”.)

This huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53. The possibility of that big move happening seemed even more likely after reports surfaced on April 12 that Angie had met and fallen in love with a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.

gossipcop-4796409702,1,"Kim Kardashian is allegedly “phasing out” mom Kris Jenner, particularly when it comes to her responsibilities as her longtime manager, amid reports Kim is ready for a total image overhaul after returning to the spotlight following her October robbery.  That’s according to a new report by Radar Online, who’s claiming that the mother-daughter duo could be caught in a nasty feud as a source alleged that Kardashian has had somewhat of an epiphany during her time away from the spotlight and allegedly has now opened her eyes to see how Jenner “used her” to build the Kardashian brand.  According to the site, Kim is ready to project a very different image from the uber-glamorous money flaunting Kardashian fans used to know and is allegedly ready to kick mom Kris to the curb, at least professionally, in order to do so.  A source alleged to the site this week that Kim now “seems to be thinking that Kris used her to get where she is today,” which Radar Online is alleging could have led to a nasty feud between Jenner and her daughter as well as the reality star reportedly making a pretty big business decision when it comes to her mom.  “[Kim] will never think of [Kris] in the same way again,” the source said of Jenner’s supposed drama with her daughter amid reports she believes Jenner has been “using” her for years.  The site then went on to report that Kim is now in the process of projecting her new toned-down image amid the feud claims with Kris, revealing that Jenner may no longer play such a big part in Kardashian’s career going forward.  “Kim hired a transition team to make sure that she gives off a different image than she did previously,” the source said of Jenner and her daughter potentially parting ways professionally, claiming that “part of this process includes phasing out [Kris’s] management.”  While Kris and Kim have not commented on the claims, this isn’t the first time it’s been reported that Kardashian may be looking to distance herself from Jenner, at least professionally, in the wake of her October robbery in Paris.  Radar Online claimed back in October that Kim Kardashian had grown wise to Kris Jenner’s “money making machine” after taking some downtime at the end of 2016, alleging at the time that Kim has been so busy with her career that she’s failed to realize how much Jenner, who is often referred to as her “momager,” had been controlling her life and career.  “Kim never realized how much [Kris] and the money-making machine was controlling her until this robbery,” an insider told the site of Kardashian’s feelings about Jenner at the time, months before it was reported that the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is allegedly looking to “phase out” Kris from her career.  “Kim is just starting to think that maybe Kris’s intentions were not pure all along,” continued the source in October, adding that Kim has been doing a lot of thinking about her father Robert Kardashian while taking some time away which has allegedly helped her to get wise to Kris’s seemingly relentless pursuit of fame for herself and her family.  “[Kim] told her family that she wanted to be the girl that her father wanted her to be and not the girl that she became with Kris’s help,” a source revealed last year, just months before it was reported that a feud could be brewing between Kardashian and Jenner.

When she was 9, her family moved to the Albany, New York, suburb[12] of Delmar, where she attended Bethlehem Central High School.[13] She obtained an undergraduate degree in political science from the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University in 1992[9] and earned a J.D. from Albany Law School in 1995.[14] Kelly was an associate in the Chicago office of law firm Bickel & Brewer LLP, during which time she co-wrote an article for the American Bar Association's journal, Litigation, called ""The Conflicting Roles of Lawyer as Director"".[15] She later joined Jones Day for nine years, where one of her clients was the credit bureau Experian.[16] Television career [ edit ] Early career [ edit ] In 2003, Kelly moved to Washington, D.C., where she was hired by the ABC affiliate WJLA-TV as a general assignment reporter.[10] While there, she covered significant national and local events, including live coverage of the confirmation hearings for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. and Chief Justice John G. Roberts; the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor; the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist; and the 2004 presidential election.[17] After working as a journalist for WJLA, Kelly then applied for a job at Fox News in 2004.[17] CNN president Jonathan Klein would later regret not hiring Kelly as a reporter at the beginning of her career, as she was ""the one talent you'd want to have from somewhere else"".[18] Fox News [ edit ] Kelly contributed legal segments for Special Report with Brit Hume and hosted her own legal segment, Kelly's Court, during Weekend Live. She appeared on a weekly segment on The O'Reilly Factor and occasionally filled in for Greta Van Susteren on On the Record, where most of her reporting focused on legal and political matters. She occasionally contributed as an anchor, but more often as a substitute anchor on weekends.[19] On February 1, 2010, Kelly began hosting her own two-hour afternoon show, America Live, replacing Fox News' previous show The Live Desk.[20][21] She has been a guest-panelist on Fox News' late-night satire program Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld. In 2010, viewership for America Live increased by 20%, averaging 1,293,000 viewers, and increased by 4% in the 25–54 age demographic, averaging 268,000 viewers.[22] In December 2010, Kelly was confirmed to be hosting a New Year's Eve special with Bill Hemmer.[23] Kelly received media attention for her coverage of the results of the 2012 United States presidential election. On November 6, 2012 (the night of the election), Fox News' decision desk projected that Obama would win a second term after part of the results had been released. In response to Karl Rove's opposition to this projection, Kelly walked backstage to the decision desk on camera and spoke with them, and also asked Rove, ""Is this just math that you do as a Republican to make yourself feel better? Or is this real?""[24][25][26][27] Kelly left as host of America Live in the beginning of July 2013 for maternity leave and returned to host a new nightly program The Kelly File on October 7, 2013.[28][29] Over the years, The Kelly File has at different times overtaken the channel's regular number one The O'Reilly Factor in ratings.[30][31] However, The Kelly File has also been overtaken by Hannity.[32] In December 2013, remarks made by Kelly in reaction to a Slate article drew controversy. On The Kelly File, she said, ""For all you kids watching at home, Santa just is white, but this person is just arguing that maybe we should also have a black Santa,"" adding, ""But Santa is what he is, and just so you know, we're just debating this because someone wrote about it."" Kelly also stated that Jesus was a white man later in the segment.[33] Soon after, Jon Stewart,[34] Stephen Colbert,[35] Rachel Maddow,[36] Josh Barro,[37] and others satirized her remarks.[38] Two days later, she made additional on-air statements, characterizing her original comments as ""tongue-in-cheek"",[39][40][41][42][43] and that the skin color of Jesus is ""far from settled"".[44] In June 2015, Kelly interviewed Jim Bob Duggar and Michelle Duggar of 19 Kids and Counting regarding their son Josh Duggar's alleged molestation of five girls in 2002. She later interviewed two of their daughters, Jill and Jessa. This show's Nielsen national estimates ratings of 3.09 million viewers, above its average 2.11 million, ranked with the 3.2 million for the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 coverage and 7.3 million for the Ferguson riots coverage.[45] In the Republican Party presidential debate on August 6, 2015, Kelly asked whether a man of Trump's temperament ought to be elected president.[46] Kelly's moderating generated a range of media and political","reactions, from praise to criticism. Trump, later that night, retweeted a Twitter post from a user who called Kelly a ""bimbo"".[47] During the debate, Kelly had also questioned Trump about his treatment of women, and after the debate, Trump said that Kelly had ""blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever"".[48] The comment was widely regarded as sexist and misogynistic, and Trump's subsequent refusal to apologize led to several companies terminating their business relationships with him.[49] In a subsequent interview, Kelly said she had questioned Trump about his treatment of women because she believed that ""it's important to ask tough questions and hold people in positions of power accountable.""[50] In November 2016, Kelly interviewed entertainer and businessman Steve Harvey about his meeting with then President-elect Donald Trump. During the interview, Kelly asked Harvey about his conversation with Trump, and Harvey replied that Trump had asked him to help ""bring some positive attention to the inner cities and to the urban communities"".[51] In January 2017, Kelly announced that she would be leaving Fox News and joining NBC News, where she would host a new daytime talk show, Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly, which premiered on June 4, 2017. The move was widely reported as a significant departure from Fox News, where Kelly had been a longtime host and correspondent, and was seen as a sign of the changing media landscape and the increasing competition between television networks.[52][53] Departure from Fox News and move to NBC News [ edit ] On January 3, 2017, Kelly announced that she would be leaving Fox News to join NBC News, where she would host a new daytime talk show, Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly. The move was widely reported as a significant departure from Fox News, where Kelly had been a longtime host and correspondent, and was seen as a sign of the changing media landscape and the increasing competition between television networks.[54][55] The decision was reportedly made after Kelly had been offered a multimillion-dollar contract with NBC News, which was seen as a significant increase over her previous salary at Fox News. Kelly's new show, Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly, premiered on June 4, 2017, and featured interviews with a variety of guests, including politicians, celebrities, and other public figures. Kelly's move to NBC News was seen as a significant coup for the network, which had been looking to bolster its lineup of news programming and attract a wider audience. The move was also seen as a sign of the increasing competition between television networks, as NBC News looked to challenge Fox News' dominance in the cable news market.[56] In addition to her work on Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly, Kelly also began hosting a new morning show, Megyn Kelly Today, on September 25, 2017. The show replaced the long-running Today's Take and was seen as a significant expansion of Kelly's role at NBC News. The show featured a mix of news, entertainment, and lifestyle segments, and was designed to appeal to a broad audience of viewers.[57] Overall, Kelly's move to NBC News was seen as a significant development in the television industry, and marked a new chapter in her career as a journalist and television host.",paraphrase_generation

gossipcop-3967904178,1,"Watch Entertainment Tonight on Yahoo View.  Music’s odd couple, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton — aka the rocker and the country boy — have never been free of gossip speculating about their relationship. Apparently, the latest news is that the two are through. In Touch Weekly reports that Shelton actually unceremoniously dumped Stefani in February before embarking on a tour.  But wait — if that’s the case, then why is Stefani appearing with him on stage? And not just appearing … they’re appearing pretty cuddly. The singer posted an Instagram shot on Mar. 14 of the two embracing on what appears to be the most recent date of his “Country Music Freaks” trek.      This isn’t the first such picture she has shared since February. She posted several different angles of a jumbotron kiss on Feb. 25, and on March 11, one of herself hanging out with country up-and-comer Carly Pearce, who is an opener on Shelton’s tour, and another that shows off a backstage crowd (including Shelton and her younger brother Todd) in Greensboro, N.C.      Additionally, she sent good wishes to him on Mar. 1 — when Shelton was reportedly attempting to power through a Houston date while sick with the flu — and shared his latest video, “I Lived It” with a glowing string of hashtags.      So if the breakup is fake news, what spurred the rumors? According to In Touch‘s “insider” source, all of Stefani’s social media support is “a desperate attempt to ignore the truth,” and Shelton dumped her due to her “neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband, and her jealousy of him and other women.”  If this is to be believed, current Voice champion Chloe Kohanski was a factor in the breakup — Coach Shelton was apparently getting too close for Stefani’s comfort — as well as Shelton’s ex-wife Miranda Lambert, with whom the outlet claims he has rekindled a friendship and is “sharing intimate details” of his life.  Shelton isn’t reciprocating Stefani’s loving social media deluge — but then again, he’s never been one to do so. His social media accounts, once a source of ribald jokes, have developed gradually into a more businesslike platform to market his music and work on The Voice. He does, however, maintain a picture of Stefani as his profile photo.  Read more from Yahoo Entertainment:","You are a journalist. Given a 'passage', please paraphrase it.

gossipcop-1634815619,1,"California is “the darkest state in the Union,” according to country singer Dolly Parton, who claims that the state has been hit with a series of “Biblical disasters” in recent times as punishment for “embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Parton predicted Los Angeles will suffer a similar fate to Sodom and Gomorrah, the Biblical cities synonymous with vice, darkness and impenitent sin.  “California just keeps on being hit by disaster after disaster as foretold in the Bible,” the Grammy Award-winning entertainer and businesswoman told guests at Dolly Parton’s Stampede, a dinner and entertainment evening.  “Pestilence, and epidemics, and crime, and disease. And you know what? They don’t even realize what is happening to them. They are so corrupted, they can’t even see what is right in front of their eyes.”  “First they had the drought that lasted years and years, killing off billions and billions of dollars in crops, and making the soil so incredibly dry that a large rainstorm could easily turn into a major flood.  “Then they had the fires. Awful, awful fires. Historical, deadly fires. Thousands lost their homes, scores lost their lives and their livelihoods. Did you know the Thomas fire is still burning? In the winter!“  “And now they just had dozens of homes destroyed by mudslides,” Tennessee-born Parton said, making reference to the mudslides that have killed 15 people, with the toll expected to climb above 30. The mudslide hit an affluent part of California, and damaged Oprah Winfrey’s house.  “When they get hit with the ‘Big One‘, Parton said, referencing the popular name for the super quake expected to rock California in the future, “then we will know that the End Times have truly begun.”  “And don’t forget the sexual abuse scandals rocking Hollywood. They are being punished for embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Is California suffering from bad weather and bad luck, or is Parton right? Could a vengeful God be punishing California for decades of vice and sin?  Parton, who has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and been nominated for two Academy Awards, has previously stated that she considers herself an entertainer, and doesn’t believe it is her role to get involved with politics.  At last year’s Emmys, Parton was joined onstage by Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda to present an award.

Tomlin and Fonda took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump, but Parton refused to join in, maintaining a dignified silence.","Parton has been criticized by some for her lack of political engagement.  According to Parton, her lack of political engagement has more to do with her faith than her celebrity status.  In a statement, Parton said: “I don’t get involved in politics because I don’t think that’s what God put me on this earth to do. I don’t think it’s appropriate for me to be involved in politics. I think my job is to entertain people and make them happy. I don’t think it’s right for me to use my platform to push my beliefs on others.”  Parton has been a household name for decades, and has a reputation for being a down-to-earth, wholesome entertainer who has managed to maintain a squeaky-clean image despite the fact that she has been in the public eye for most of her life.  She is also known for her generosity and charitable work, and has donated millions of dollars to various causes, including disaster relief.  In 2016, Parton donated $1,000 a month for six months to families affected by wildfires in Tennessee.  In 2017, she donated $5 million to the Harvey Relief Fund to support the victims of Hurricane Harvey in Texas.  In 2018, Parton donated $1 million to the California Community Foundation’s Wildfire Relief Fund to support the victims of the California wildfires.  Parton is not alone in her belief that California is being punished for its sins.  In 2017, televangelist Jim Bakker claimed that the state’s wildfires were a sign of God’s wrath, and that California was undergoing “judgment” for its liberal policies and rejection of God.  Bakker, who hosts the Jim Bakker Show, a Christian television program, said that God was sending a message to California through the wildfires, and that the state needed to repent and turn back to God.  Bakker has also claimed that Hurricane Harvey was a sign of God’s wrath, and that the storm was a warning to America to repent and turn back to God.  Bakker is not the only religious leader to claim that natural disasters are a sign of God’s wrath.  In 2011, televangelist Pat Robertson claimed that Hurricane Katrina was God’s punishment for America’s tolerance of homosexuality.  Robertson, who hosts The 700 Club, a Christian television program, said that God was angry with America for its acceptance of gay marriage and its rejection of God’s laws.  Robertson has also claimed that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were a sign of God’s wrath, and that the attacks were a warning to America to repent and turn back to God.  In 2018, Parton, who has been married to her husband, Carl Dean, for 52 years, released a new album, “I Believe in Santa Claus,” which includes a song called “Mudslide,” which was written by Parton and her co-writer, Kent Wells.  The song tells the story of a man who loses his home in a mudslide and is forced to rebuild his life.  Parton has not yet commented on whether the song was inspired by the recent mudslides in California.  Parton has, however, spoken out about her faith and her belief in the power of prayer.  In an interview with Fox News, Parton said: “I think prayer is the most powerful thing in the world. I think it’s the greatest gift that we have. I think it’s what keeps us going. I think it’s what gives us hope.”  Parton has also spoken out about her belief in the afterlife.  In an interview with The Guardian, Parton said: “I believe in an afterlife. I believe that there’s something bigger than us out there. I believe that there’s a God, and I believe that He’s looking out for us.”  Parton has also spoken out about her belief in the importance of forgiveness.  In an interview with HuffPost, Parton said: “I think forgiveness is the key to happiness. I think it’s the key to a good life. I think it’s the key to everything. If we can’t forgive ourselves and others, then we’re never going to be happy.”  Parton has also spoken out about her belief in the power of love.  In an interview with People magazine, Parton said: “I think love is the answer to everything. I think love is the most powerful thing in the world. I think it’s what makes us human. I think it’s what makes us real.”  Parton has also spoken out about her belief in the importance of family.  In an interview with Good Housekeeping, Parton said: “I think family is the most important thing in the world. I think it’s what makes us who we are. I think it’s what gives us our values and our morals.”  Parton has also spoken out about her belief in the importance of hard work.  In an interview with Forbes, Parton said: “I think hard work is the key to success. I think it’s the key to everything. I think if you want something, you have to work for it. I think if you want to be successful, you have to work hard.”  Parton has also spoken out about her belief in the importance of staying true to oneself.  In an interview with Oprah Magazine, Parton said: “I think it’s important to stay true to yourself. I think it’s important to be who you are. I think it’s important to not let other people dictate who you are or what you do.”  Parton has also spoken out about her belief in the importance of embracing one’s flaws.  In an interview with Cosmopolitan, Parton said: “I think it’s important to embrace your flaws. I think it’s important to love yourself, flaws and all. I think it’s important to not try to be perfect. I think it’s important to be real.”  Parton has also spoken out about her belief in the importance of gratitude.  In an interview with Parade, Parton said: “I think gratitude is the key to happiness. I think it’s the key to a good life. I think it’s the key to everything. If we can’t be grateful for what we have, then we’re never going to be happy.”  Parton has also spoken out about her belief in the importance of giving back.  In an interview with Variety, Parton said: “I think it’s important to give back. I think it’s important to help others. I think it’s important to make a difference in the world.”  Parton has also spoken out about her belief in the importance of being kind.  In an interview with Southern Living, Parton said: “I think kindness is the key to everything. I think it’s the key to happiness. I think it’s the key to a good life. I think it’s the key to everything. If we can’t be kind to each other, then we’re never going to be happy.”  Parton has also spoken out about her belief in the importance of following one’s dreams.

I think it’s important to not let other people dictate who you are or what you do.”  Parton has also spoken out about her belief in the importance of taking risks.  In an interview with Entrepreneur, Parton said: “I think it’s important to take risks. I think it’s important to take chances. I think it’s important to step outside of your comfort zone. I think it’s important to not be afraid to fail.”  Parton has also spoken out about her belief in the importance of being true to oneself.  In an interview with Refinery29, Parton said: “I think it’s important to be true to yourself. I think it’s important to be who you are.

In a video being circulated, which is entitled - Rihanna: ‘If Jesus Hasn’t Answered Your Prayers, Try Satan’, published December 2, 2017, on the World News Today YouTube Channel, a scripted voice says that Rihanna told the audience that growing up in Bridgetown was not easy and that you have to work twice as hard to make it. And the British anonymous voice went on to say that she said:  ""You have to hustle. I’m still hustling, but I am living proof that you can do anything...

Then it went on to claim that the Prime Minister of Barbados the Rt. Hon. Freundel Stuart intervened hastily and shocked parents removed their children. On the night in question, the Prime Minister conferred the title of Cultural Ambassador on Robyn 'Rihanna' Fenty.

Rihanna added:  ""I always knew it would happen, I always focused on the result, and that kind of faith, it really was just faith that childlike faith, that even now when I get a little bit discouraged or doubtful, it’s the thing that I go back to, having faith in God, like that even as a child.”  (Photo caption: Rihanna with her head bowed during the opening prayer at the renaming ceremony.

PHOTOS: Iggy's red carpet style The loved-up couple have been inseparable for the past few months. In June the chart topping singer celebrated her birthday with a trip to Mexico with Young.

In the early hours of Tuesday, Sept. 9, Katy Perry took to Twitter to warn her 56.7 million followers of an unnamed mean girl — less than 24 hours after fresh speculation began of a supposed feud between Perry and Swift. ""Watch out for the Regina George in sheep's clothing…"" Perry, 29, tweeted without context on Tuesday, referencing the lead character and ultimate mean girl, played by Rachel McAdams, who faced off against Cady Heron, played by Lindsay Lohan, in the hit 2004 comedy Mean Girls. PHOTOS: Taylor Swift's Celebrity BFFs The cryptic words followed widespread chatter that there is tension between the ""This Is How We Do"" performer and Swift, 24. The drama started when the ""Shake It Off"" singer gave a revealing cover story interview for the new issue of Rolling Stone, and at one point during the sit-down, spoke tantalizingly of issues she has with another famous female artist. PHOTOS: Celebrity Feuds: The Biggest Ever Said artist is the subject of a song called ""Bad Blood,"" which is featured on Swift's upcoming album, 1989. Explaining the song's inspiration, she told Rolling Stone, ""For years, I was never sure if we were friends or not. She would come up to me at awards shows and say something and walk away, and I would think, 'Are we friends, or did she just give me the harshest insult of my life?'… She did something so horrible. I was like, 'Oh, we're just straight-up enemies.' And it wasn't even about a guy! It had to do with business. She basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour. She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me. And I'm surprisingly non-confrontational — you would not believe how much I hate conflict. So now I have to avoid her. It's awkward, and I don't like it."" While Swift mentioned that the feud wasn't about a boy, she and Perry both famously dated John Mayer, and Rolling Stone notes that when ""pressed,"" Swift said there was a personal aspect to the drama, ""but I don't think there would be any personal problem if she weren't competitive."" Both chart-topping women were also on tour beginning in February 2011, with Perry wrapping in January 2012 and Swift in March 2012. PHOTOS: Katy Perry's Craziest Style Moments For her part, Swift chose not to offer further clues as to the inspiration for ""Bad Blood.""

The drama started when the ""Shake It Off"" singer gave a revealing cover story interview for the new issue of Rolling Stone, and at one point during the sit-down, spoke tantalizingly of issues she has with another famous female artist. PHOTOS: Celebrity Feuds: The Biggest Ever Said artist is the subject of a song called ""Bad Blood,"" which is featured on Swift's upcoming album, 1989. Explaining the song's inspiration, she told Rolling Stone, ""For years, I was never sure if we were friends or not. She would come up to me at awards shows and say something and walk away, and I would think, 'Are we friends, or did she just give me the harshest insult of my life?'… She did something so horrible. I was like, 'Oh, we're just straight-up enemies.' And it wasn't even about a guy! It had to do with business. She basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour. She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me. And I'm surprisingly non-confrontational — you would not believe how much I hate conflict. So now I have to avoid her. It's awkward, and I don't like it."" While Swift mentioned that the feud wasn't about a boy, she and Perry both famously dated John Mayer, and Rolling Stone notes that when ""pressed,"" Swift said there was a personal aspect to the drama, ""but I don't think there would be any personal problem if she weren't competitive."" Both chart-topping women were also on tour beginning in February 2011, with Perry wrapping in January 2012 and Swift in March 2012. PHOTOS: Katy Perry's Craziest Style Moments For her part, Swift chose not to offer further clues as to the inspiration for ""Bad Blood."" Other artists whose names have been included in the talk include Miley Cyrus and Demi Lovato. In an online watercooler poll at Us Weekly, 70 percent of more than 8,500 readers who voted guessed the song was about Cyrus. Bachelor in Paradise's Michelle and Cody Want to Wed -- Maybe on TV! Michelle Money and Cody Sattler may have left paradise, but they're still very much in the honeymoon period of their relationship. The reality stars, who fell in love as contestants on ABC's Bachelor spin-off Bachelor in Paradise, are even more smitten now than they were when they filmed the finale back in June. ""It's been so easy, and it's only gotten better since the show ended,"" personal trainer Sattler tells Us Weekly exclusively. ""It's going in the right direction, I can tell you that!"" Money had looked for love on two previous Bachelor Nation shows — Brad Womack's second season of The Bachelor in 2011, and season two of Bachelor Pad later that same year — but it took going to paradise to find her perfect match. (Sattler was a contestant on Andi Dorfman's season of The Bachelorette in 2014.)

I've had some amazing experiences and met incredible people, but I've never met anyone as amazing as Cody. I never thought someone like him existed. It's been such a beautiful surprise."" The lovebirds currently live in different states, but they talk and text ""all day, every day,"" and they also make it a point to see each other in person every other weekend, Money says, adding that they just returned from a vacation with her family. ""It was amazing. My family adores him."" That includes her 9-year-old daughter, Brielle. ""She loves Cody,"" Money gushes. ""We laugh nonstop. Cody is a big jungle gym for her — she climbs all over him. They're like two little kids."" She adds of her beau: ""He has such a positive, genuine,","sweet energy. He's always putting others before himself. I've never seen him get upset or angry. He's just a very special person."" Sattler has a similar glowing assessment of his girlfriend. ""Michelle is the most caring, nurturing person I've ever met,"" he says. ""She's a great mother, an amazing partner. She's so intelligent and witty. I just feel like I've hit the jackpot. We have so much fun together. I can't imagine my life without her."" Money, 34, and Sattler, 28, are so smitten that they're considering a televised wedding. ""We've talked about it,"" Money says. ""It's definitely something we would consider. It's been a big part of our journey, and we've been so open about our relationship from the beginning. Why not share that, too?"" Sattler adds, ""We've had so much support from the fans. It would be cool to have them be a part of our big day, too."" For now, they're just enjoying their love story and taking things one day at a time. ""We're just happy,"" Money says. ""And we're really bad at making plans, so we'll see what happens!""",paraphrase_generation

Mila Kunis has no issue disregarding the tabloid rumors that circulate about her and her family. In an interview with Cosmopolitan, she revealed that she doesn't read anything written about herself and is therefore unaware of the majority of the gossip. However, her family members are not always able to shake off the rumors as easily, as they have sometimes believed them to be true. Kunis shared that her parents and grandparents have been confused by false headlines, such as one that claimed she had been rushed to the hospital during a pregnancy. This caused significant stress for her loved ones, which she acknowledges. On a more lighthearted note, Kunis mentioned that her father always hopes the pregnancy rumors are true and jokingly asks if there's another baby on the way. The actress has learned to ignore the gossip and instead focuses on being a good mother, wife, and person.

Caitlyn's decision to transition has been a source of controversy for the Kardashian-Jenner clan.  The family has been publicly supportive of Caitlyn's decision, but sources close to the clan have revealed that tensions have been running high.  It's not clear whether the Kardashian-Jenner clan will take any further action in response to Caitlyn's planned nude shoot.  But a source close to the family told DailyMail.com: 'They don't know what to do about it. They're just hoping it doesn't happen.'  The news of Jenner's planned shoot comes just weeks after she was pictured on the cover of Sports Illustrated in a swimsuit.  The glamour modeling job was seen as a first step in her return to the public eye.  Jenner, who has been photographed by famed snapper Annie Leibovitz, has also been working on a memoir and a TV show.  It's not clear which magazine Caitlyn plans to grace with her nude form, but it's likely to be a major publication.  The transgender icon has been making waves in the fashion world, recently landing a coveted spot on the cover of Harper's Bazaar.  The bombshell news comes as Caitlyn continues to make headlines with her tell-all memoir, The Secrets of My Life.  In the book, she reveals that her late ex-wife Kris knew about her gender struggles",paraphrase_generation

I mean [without therapy], I don't know how you're supposed to do [life].""","The Good Time actor also mentioned how he used to work a lot to avoid dealing with his personal issues. ""I used to work all the time because I was so scared of dealing with my personal life.""  In conclusion, Pattinson shared that he still goes to therapy and it has been a long time since he has been doing it.  He said, ""I've been doing it for so long now, it's just become a part of my routine.""  So, he still goes to therapy, despite all the crazy things that come with being famous.  And he believes that it's important to do so, in order to maintain one's sanity in the midst of all the chaos that comes with being in the public eye.",paraphrase_generation

Kim was married to New Jersey Nets player Kris Humphries for just 72 days. He has played for four different NBA teams since the well-documented brief marriage.","In 2015, Oklahoma City Thunder point guard Russell Westbrook married Nina Earl, who played basketball at UCLA. They have a child together, but she has not been able to avoid the curse.  Westbrook’s play has declined since marrying, and he is now averaging a career-low 24.2 points per game.  The 28-year-old Griffin, who was selected first overall by the Clippers in 2009, has been injury-prone throughout his career. He has suffered several injuries including a broken kneecap and a partially torn quad.  Griffin has averaged 21.5 points, 9.4 rebounds and 4.2 assists per game in his career.  His relationship with Jenner, who has been a part of the Kardashian clan for several years, has been closely watched.  This trade, along with the other NBA trades, certainly raises questions about the impact of a Kardashian relationship on a player’s career.  The Kardashians have certainly been known to create a media frenzy around their personal lives, which can be a distraction for their partners.  It will be interesting to see how Griffin’s career fares in Detroit and whether he can avoid the supposed curse.

Here's a paraphrased version of the passage:

Blake Griffin, a former Clippers player, has been traded to the Detroit Pistons due to his history of injuries. This trade has sparked discussion about the potential impact of his relationship with Kendall Jenner, a member of the Kardashian family, on his career. The Pistons will also acquire draft picks in the trade, while the Clippers will receive Tobias Harris, Avery Bradley, and Boban Marjanovic. The trade has raised questions about the so-called ""Kardashian curse,"" which suggests that dating a Kardashian can lead to a decline in an athlete's performance. This theory is supported by the experiences of athletes such as Lamar Odom and Kris Humphries, who saw a decline in their careers after marrying into the Kardashian family. Griffin's relationship with Jenner has been closely watched, and it remains to be seen how his career will fare in Detroit.",paraphrase_generation

Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin' to Get Out (1982). Her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993), followed by her first leading role in a major film, Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999). Jolie's starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her successful action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014). In the 2010s, Jolie expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), By the Sea (2015), and First They Killed My Father (2017). In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she separated from her third husband, actor Brad Pitt, in September 2016. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally. Early life and family Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[2] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[3] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[4] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[5][6] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[5] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[7] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[5][8] After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[9] Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.[10] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[11] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[12] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[13] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[9] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions. Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area's affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income. She was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.[11] Her early attempts at modeling, at her mother's insistence, proved unsuccessful.[14][15] She then transferred to Moreno High School, an alternative school, where she became a ""punk outsider,""[14] wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing, and experimenting with knife play with her live-in boyfriend.[11] She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director,[12] taking at-home courses to study embalming.[16] At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies,[9][14] though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation, ""I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk kid with tattoos.""[17] As a teenager, Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she self-harmed,[18] later commenting, ""For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me.""[19] She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder,[16] and began experimenting with drugs; by age 20, she had used ""just about every drug possible,"" particularly heroin.[20] Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicide—at age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her.[12] When she was 24, she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center's psychiatric ward.[12] Two years later, after adopting her first child, Jolie found stability in her life, later stating, ""I knew once I committed to Maddox, I would never be self-destructive again.""[21] Jolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father, which began when Voight left the family when his daughter was less than a year old.[22] She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press.[23] They reconciled when they appeared together in","You are a journalist.

Reality TV star Kim Kardashian said she is not actively considering a career in politics but she would not rule out the possibility of running for office. The 37-year-old entrepreneur recently met US President Donald Trump to discuss prison reforms after she spent months working with her legal team in a bid to get Alice Johnson parole.  Following her meeting with the president, Alice, who was sentenced to life in prison without parole in 1997 on money laundering and drug conspiracy charges, was released from Aliceville Correctional Facility in Alabama.

She had previously visited the White House Correspondents' Dinner with her husband Kanye West.  The meeting between Kardashian and Trump lasted for less than an hour, but it was enough to spark speculation about a potential political future for the reality TV star.  However, Kardashian has made it clear that she has no immediate plans to run for office.  “I don’t think that’s the path for me,” she said.  But, she added, “I do think that people should use their platform for good.”  In the past, Kardashian has used her platform to raise awareness about various social and political issues, including LGBTQ rights, racial injustice, and gun control.  In an interview with CNN, Kardashian said that she believes that people should use their platform to make a positive impact on the world.  She said, “I think that we all have a responsibility to use our platform for good.  And, if we can, to help make a positive change in the world.”  The reality TV star also said that she is not afraid to speak out against injustice, even if it means facing criticism.  “I don’t care if people don’t agree with me.  I don’t care if people criticize me.  I’m going to speak out about things that I believe in and things that I feel are important,” she said.  Kardashian's meeting with Trump was seen as a significant moment in her political activism.  It marked the first time that a reality TV star had met with a sitting US president to discuss prison reforms.  The meeting was also significant because it highlighted the growing influence of celebrities in politics.  In recent years, several celebrities have used their platform to raise awareness about various social and political issues.  Actors like George Clooney, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson have all been involved in various political causes.  Musicians like Kanye West, Beyoncé, and Taylor Swift have also used their platform to speak out about social and political issues.  However, Kardashian's meeting with Trump was not without controversy.  Some critics accused her of using her celebrity status to get special treatment for Alice Johnson.  Others accused her of being a publicity seeker.  But, Kardashian has denied these accusations.  She said that she was motivated by a desire to help Alice Johnson, who had been unfairly imprisoned for over 20 years.  “I didn’t do this for publicity.  I did this because I saw an injustice and I wanted to help,” she said.  In conclusion, Kim Kardashian's meeting with US President Donald Trump highlighted the growing influence of celebrities in politics.  While Kardashian has made it clear that she has no immediate plans to run for office, she has used her platform to raise awareness about various social and political issues.  She believes that people should use their platform for good and to make a positive impact on the world.  Whether or not Kardashian will continue to be involved in politics remains to be seen.  But, one thing is certain – her meeting with Trump has sparked a lot of interest and debate about the role of celebrities in politics.",paraphrase_generation
gossipcop-5077951266,1,"The royal wedding is a multi-million dollar affair. Chris Jackson / Getty  The average cost of a wedding for couples in the US and the UK is around $34,000 (£23,700).  Five figures is a huge expense for a one-day affair. That is, unless you're ultra-rich — and especially if you're royalty rich.  Next month, the world will bear witness to the most anticipated royal wedding in years. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to be married on May 19 at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor, and will begin a carriage procession immediately after the ceremony. Their reception will take place later on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding, an expense traditionally taken on by the bride's family.  The case was the same for Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 royal wedding— the only item Middleton paid for was her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress. Their total wedding celebration cost $34 million (£23.7 million).  Markle and Prince Harry's wedding will reportedly cost in excess of $45.8 million (£32 million), according to Bride Book's estimation. That's over 1,000 more than the average wedding.  The venue is the biggest part of a typical wedding budget for couples in the US and the UK, taking up nearly half of the entire wedding cost. Access to St. George's Chapel — and St. George's Great Hall, where the wedding reception will take place — is free of charge for Markle and Prince Harry. Transportation is also free, thanks to the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys.  The greatest cost for the royal couple? Security.

Gomez’s rekindled friendship with Justin Bieber, however, had nothing to do with the rapper’s decision to end his romance with the singer.  As Gossip Cop reported, Gomez and The Weeknd recently split after nearly a year of dating. The pair weren’t seen together much during the summer, though it was later revealed the singer-actress was laying low due to a kidney transplant. Regardless, they still appeared to be going strong in the early fall. Prior to the announcement of their breakup, the status of their relationship was questioned after it emerged Gomez had rekindled her friendship with Bieber. © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  On Sunday, that speculation swirled as Bieber and Gomez were seen in public and The Weeknd stopped following her friends on social media. That being said, Bieber was allegedly not responsible for the breakup. Rather, it was the challenges of a long-distance relationship, particularly with The Weeknd touring and Gomez’s shooting schedule, that led both the former couple to reconsider their fizzling relationship.  Additionally, contributing to their split, the rapper felt “tied down” in a relationship that had lost its spark. Over time, the pair started talking less frequently on the phone, prompting The Weeknd to end his romance with Gomez, reports TMZ. Despite their breakup, we’re told that the pair are still on good terms and have talked several times since the split.  Predictably, after the rapper ended his relationship with Gomez, Gossip Cop busted the often disproven HollywoodLife for claiming in a made-up report that The Weeknd was “heartbroken” over Gomez reconnecting with Bieber.

Photo credit: Mega  The talk-show host is a notorious house-flipper — investing in properties before cashing out when the real-estate market heats up. But according to sources, her recent spree is less about the money and more about having separate residences as she and Portia inch closer toward officially separating. Photo credit: Mega  “They spend less and less time together ,” said one source. “In fact, they’ve been living separate lives. It’s gotten so bad that they hardly say a word to each other all day.” Photo credit: Mega  “Portia feels neglected and mistreated,” another insider told The ENQUIRER. “She feels as if she supports Ellen in everything she does, while Ellen just gets aggravated and judgmental when it comes to her needs.” Photo credit: Mega  If they do announce a divorce, it promises to be one of the most expensive in Hollywood history! “With their combined fortune, future earnings and property totaling $400 million, it’ll be a good day to be their divorce lawyers!” claimed an insider. Photo credit: Mega  “The idea of going through that mess is probably the glue that’s kept them together this long!” A sour-faced Ellen was pictured without her wedding ring during a Beverly Hills shopping spree on April 20. At the time, talk heated up that her high-profile union was under pressure. Photo credit: Mega  But in the days that followed, she and Portia paraded their “happy” marriage in front of paparazzi at multiple Hollywood hot spots, usually arm in arm and sporting painful smiles. “Nobody is convinced,” a source said. “They aren’t intimate!” Photo credit: Mega  While a friend of Ellen’s brushed off talk of divorce, the couple’s marriage has exploded many times before, according to inside sources. But The ENQUIRER’s mole fears the worst as Portia continues to spend days alone at her own $17.3 million bolt-hole in Beverly Hills. Photo credit: Mega  “It’s usually Portia who walks out whenever they fight,” the insider claimed. “Ellen has a great TV personality, but at home she’s a bore who goes to bed every night at nine.” “Arrested Development” star Portia has also complained Ellen cares more about her fur-shedding cats and dogs, said the source. Photo credit: Getty I","Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi have been facing marital issues, with Ellen leaving their shared home and the couple reportedly preparing for a $400 million divorce. Sources claim that the couple has been fighting frequently, with Ellen going to great lengths to keep the news from their friends. The couple's marriage has been under pressure, with Ellen publicly insisting that their marriage is solid while sources claim that they have been spending nights alone and living apart. Ellen has been investing in separate properties, including an $18.6 million beachfront mansion, fueling speculation that the couple is heading towards a split.

Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner’s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  ‘She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,’ said the source. ‘But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making ‘I am Cait’ shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner’s ‘unpredictable’ behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: ‘[The book] is definitely something that she’s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  ‘But the family were like, it’s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  ‘They were worried because she’s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.’  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J.

The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’  An insider tells DailyMail.com that the Kardashians learned of the 67-year-old’s plan from her model son Brody, 33.  ‘Brody told them that Caitlyn has planned and booked a full nude photo shoot and they were like, that’s unacceptable, it’s taking things too far,' the source said.  ‘They’re hoping the shoot doesn't come to pass because that would be their worst nightmare. Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner’s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  ‘She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,’ said the source. ‘But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making ‘I am Cait’ shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner’s ‘unpredictable’ behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: ‘[The book] is definitely something that she’s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  ‘But the family were like, it’s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  ‘They were worried because she’s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.’  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty of the murder of his wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.  Kardashian, the father of Kourtney, Khloe, Kim and their brother Rob, was part of Simpson’s defense team during his 1","995 trial and maintained his client’s innocence until his death from cancer in 2003.  Jenner’s claim has been met with disbelief by Kardashian’s family, who say it is untrue and a bid for attention.  The source said: 'The family think it’s ridiculous, they’re like, why would you even bring that up?  ‘It’s just trying to stir up drama and get attention and they don’t want to be a part of it.'  The memoir, which is out later this month, promises to lift the lid on Jenner's life as a woman and her transition.  But it has already caused controversy, with a family source telling DailyMail.com that the Kardashians have been 'blindsided' by the book and feel betrayed by Jenner's decision to include 'private' information about her life with them.  The source said: 'They feel like she's exploiting their story and their lives for her own gain and they're not happy about it.'  The family source added: 'They're worried about what she's going to say in the book and how it will affect them.  They're already upset that she's doing this nude photo shoot and now they're worried about what else she's going to reveal.  'They're just trying to protect themselves and their brand and they don't want to be dragged into her drama.'  Caitlyn Jenner is planning to take it all off for a nude photo shoot, DailyMail.com can disclose.  Jenner, 67, completed gender reassignment surgery in January, according to her new memoir, ‘The Secrets of My Life’.  The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’.",paraphrase_generation
gossipcop-7384566778,1,"Kylie Jenner may have skipped out on the 2017 Kardashian Christmas card, but she did attend mom Kris Jenner’s annual Christmas Eve party in Los Angeles.  The 20-year-old cosmetics guru — who is expecting her first child, a baby girl, with boyfriend Travis Scott — did not appear in any photos from the bash shared to social media by KarJenner family members. But a source tells PEOPLE she was there celebrating away from the cameras.  “Kylie looked great but didn’t really draw any attention to her baby bump,” the source says. “She still acts like she wants to keep her pregnancy private.”  Meanwhile, her sister Khloé Kardashian, — who earlier this week confirmed that she and boyfriend Tristan Thompson are expecting their first child together — accentuated her own baby bump in a skin-tight, sparkly jumpsuit with a white fur coat.  “Khloé was beaming all night,” the insider says of the 33-year-old Revenge Body host. “She kept touching and showing off her cute baby belly.”  Khloé showed off her bump on Instagram as well.  “Merry Christmas!! May you sparkle and shine this festive season, may all of your wishes and dreams come true,” Khloé captioned a gallery of shots showing her touching her belly. “I pray that we all may feel this happiness all year round.

Kourtney’s ex-boyfriend Scott Disick was there, too — without girlfriend Sofia Richie.  “He mingled, looked good and didn’t drink,” the source says, adding that there wasn’t any awkwardness with Kourtney’s new boyfriend Younes Bendjima.  “Kourtney seemed so happy that Younes joined her,” the insider says. “They are so cute together. He kept bringing her drinks and doting on her. Younes fits right into the family. He didn’t seem uncomfortable that Scott was there. They said hello, but that was it. It was very civil.”  Other guests included Kim’s husband Kanye West, celebrity hair stylists Jen Atkin and Chris Appleton, singer Christina Aguilera and Keeping Up with the Kardashians executive producer Ryan Seacrest.

gossipcop-5865271192,1,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.

Katie Holmes, an actress, and her relationships with her boyfriend, Jamie Foxx, her ex-husband, Tom Cruise, and her daughter, Suri, have been the subject of various reports and rumors. According to RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were planning to get married in a lavish ceremony, with Suri as her bridesmaid. However, the wedding was called off when Holmes realized that Foxx wasn't ready to give up his bachelor ways, including his friendship with his ex-girlfriend, Kristin Grannis. Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, to Leonardo DiCaprio's birthday party, which allegedly upset Holmes. A source told RadarOnline that Foxx balked at signing a prenup with a no-cheating clause, and Holmes noticed a lack of respect in Foxx's behavior. She decided to break up with him to protect herself and her daughter.

Meanwhile, Tom Cruise, Holmes' ex-husband, has supposedly been trying to reconnect with their daughter, Suri, whom he hasn't seen in over five years. According to Hollywood Life, Cruise's Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn't see Suri, but he's now tired of being bossed around by them. He wants to be a part of his daughter's life, but Holmes is hesitant about a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter.

For the novel, see Thirteen Reasons Why 13 Reasons Why (stylized onscreen as TH1RTEEN R3ASONS WHY) is an American teen drama web television series developed for Netflix by Brian Yorkey, based on the 2007 novel Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher. The series revolves around seventeen year old high school student, Clay Jensen, and his deceased female friend Hannah Baker, who has committed suicide after failing to cope with the culture, gossip and lack of support from her friends and her school. A box of cassette tapes recorded by Hannah in the lead up to her suicide detail thirteen reasons why she ended her life. The series is produced by July Moon Productions, Kicked to the Curb Productions, Anonymous Content and Paramount Television, with Yorkey and Diana Son serving as showrunners. Dylan Minnette stars as Clay, while Katherine Langford plays Hannah. Christian Navarro, Alisha Boe, Brandon Flynn, Justin Prentice, Miles Heizer, Ross Butler, Devin Druid, Amy Hargreaves, Derek Luke, Kate Walsh, and Brian d'Arcy James also star. A film from Universal Pictures based on Thirteen Reasons Why began development in February 2011, with Selena Gomez set to star as Hannah, before being shelved in favor of a television series and Netflix ordering the show straight to series in October 2015, with Gomez instead serving as an executive producer. The first season was released on Netflix on March 31, 2017. It received positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised its subject matter and acting, particularly the performances of Minnette and Langford. For her performance, Langford received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Drama Series. However, its graphic depiction of issues such as suicide and rape, along with other mature content prompted concerns from mental health professionals. In response, Netflix added a warning card and from March 2018, a video that plays at the start of each season warning viewers about its themes.[2] In May 2017, Netflix renewed 13 Reasons Why for a second season; filming began the next month and concluded that December. The second season was released on May 18, 2018, and received negative reviews from critics and mixed reviews from audiences. A third season was ordered in June 2018 and is set to be released in 2019. Critical and audience reaction to the series has been divided, with the program generating controversy between audiences and industry reviewers. Premise [ edit ] In season one, seventeen year old Clay Jensen returns home from school one day to find a mysterious box on his porch. Inside he discovers seven cassette tapes recorded by Hannah Baker, his deceased classmate and unrequited love, who committed suicide two weeks earlier. On the tapes, Hannah unfolds an intensely emotional audio diary, detailing why she decided to end her life. It appears each person who receives this package of old-style tapes is fundamentally related to why she killed herself. Clay is not the first to receive the tapes, but there is implied detail as to how he should pass the tapes on after hearing them. There appears to be an order to distribution of the tapes, with an additional copy held by an overseer should the plan go awry. Each tape recording refers to a different person involved in Hannah's life contributing to a reason for her suicide. The tapes refer to both friends and enemies. In season two, months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and the other people mentioned on the tapes, as well as close friends and Hannah's family members, become embroiled in a civil legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Alleging negligence on the part of the school, Hannah's mother pursues her perception of justice, while her reluctance to settle pre-trial and her personal circumstances eventually break up her marriage with Hannah's father. The story unfolds with narratives illustrating Hannah's story told by those who present in court at trial. Clay, who perceives himself as Hannah's failed protector, embarks on an investigation using whatever evidence he can find in an effort to impact on the civil case between Hannah's parents and the school. Clay also endeavours to expose the corrupted culture of the High School and its favour of wealthy, sports savvy male students over the average student, which especially compromises the integrity of young girls such as Hannah.

Steven Silver as Marcus Cole, the self-centered student body president at Liberty High, who is responsible for humiliating and attempting to sexually assault Hannah on a date. In season 2, he is suspended from school after lying on the stand during the trial and following the leaked release of the tapes soon after.

On Metacritic, it has a score of 69 out of 100, based on 14 reviews, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". Many critics praised the show's subject matter and acting, particularly the performances of Minnette and Langford. However, some critics found the show's pacing and tone to be inconsistent. Some critics also found the show's portrayal of suicide and sexual assault to be graphic and potentially harmful. Viewership [ edit ] The first season was watched by 48 million viewers in its first four weeks of release, making it the most-watched Netflix series of 2017. The second season was released on May 18, 2018, and received negative reviews from critics and mixed reviews from audiences. A third season was ordered in June 2018 and is set to be released in 2019. Controversy [ edit ] 13 Reasons Why generated controversy between audiences and industry reviewers. Some critics argued the series romanticized suicide and could potentially harm vulnerable young viewers. In response to the criticism, Netflix added a warning card and from March 2018, a video that plays at the start of each season warning viewers about its themes. In May 2018, a study found that the show was associated with a significant increase in suicide-related searches on Google, particularly among 13-to-18-year-olds. The study's authors suggested that the show's release may have triggered suicidal thoughts in some viewers. In response to the study, Netflix stated, ""We have always recognized that 13 Reasons Why deals with sensitive and difficult topics, and we have worked hard to ensure that the show is both informative and responsible. We have received positive feedback from many viewers who have found the show to be helpful in sparking important conversations and raising awareness about these difficult issues. We have also heard concerns from some critics and experts who feel that the show may have gone too far in some areas. While many critics have praised the show for its acting, writing, and social commentary, others have criticized it for its handling of sensitive topics. Some have argued that the show romanticizes suicide and may potentially harm vulnerable young viewers. The show's graphic depiction of sexual assault, rape, and suicide has also been criticized for being gratuitous and potentially triggering. In response to these concerns, Netflix added a warning card and a video that plays at the start of each season warning viewers about its themes. In conclusion, the show was well received by both critics and audiences, but generated controversy for its handling of sensitive topics. The show's future seasons will likely continue to generate controversy and discussion as the show continues to explore difficult issues.",paraphrase_generation

However, it’s confirmed that the breakup rumours aren’t true. photography via pinterest November 2012: The couple officially breaks up; Bieber briefly linked to model Barbara Palvin Don’t go anywhere, this is just the first of many breakups. After more than a year of puppy love, the two reportedly split for the first time as a result of their jam-packed schedules.

Palvin took to Twitter, confirming that there was nothing going on between her and Bieber. photography via instagram.com/ashilrd January 2013: The pair are reportedly back together; Gomez travels to Norway to visit Bieber They clearly can’t stay away from one another for long.

Yes, but now things appear to have changed. The two celebs took their romance public on Instagram. However, it’s unclear how long the this romance lasted, as they’ve since broken up. photography via instagram.com/sofiarichie August 2016: Sofia Richie posts an Instagram of her and Bieber Yes, Sofia Richie, daughter of Lionel Richie, and sister of Nicole Richie.

An official cover has yet to be released; however, suspicions that it’s coming soon have been heightened as DJ Snake posted a longer version of Gomez’s cover on his Snapchat.

Grab a snack, because there’s a lot to dive into. photography via instagram.com/jelena_firstofall January 2011: Vacation in St. Lucia Bieber/Gomez dating rumours began to circulate in 2010. But it wasn’t until January 2011 that the pop stars confirmed their romance, namely by partaking in major PDA while on vacation together in St. Lucia. Photography by Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic February 2011: Jelena steps out on red carpet at the Vanity Fair Oscars party Yup, they finally made our dreams a reality by walking the red carpet together for the first time, thus confirming their young love. Aren’t they adorable? photography by Kevin Mazur/Contributor/Getty May 2011: Billboard Music Awards Jelena looked happy and strong at the Billboard Music Awards. Oh, young love. photography by steve granitz/contributor/getty November 2011: Jelena is over… apparently Rumours that Gomez has dumped the Canadian pop star begin to surface, after a Bieber fan claimed she had sex with him backstage at a show in October 2010, and that he is the father of her 4-month-old child. However, it’s confirmed that the breakup rumours aren’t true. photography via pinterest November 2012: The couple officially breaks up; Bieber briefly linked to model Barbara Palvin Don’t go anywhere, this is just the first of many breakups. After more than a year of puppy love, the two reportedly split for the first time as a result of their jam-packed schedules. Fans (and the internet) also begin to wonder whether there’s a relationship brewing between JB and Victoria’s Secret model Barbara Palvin. Palvin took to Twitter, confirming that there was nothing going on between her and Bieber. photography via instagram.com/ashilrd January 2013: The pair are reportedly back together; Gomez travels to Norway to visit Bieber They clearly can’t stay away from one another for long. Less than 3 months after the duo called it quits, Bieber posted the above image of them on his Instagram… and of course, promptly deleted it. Photography by Kevin Mazur/WireImage November 2014: Gomez performs at the American Music Awards The singer took to the stage to perform her single, “The Heart Wants What It Wants.” Here’s the kicker: she confirmed the song was about Bieber. After a few more on-again off-again appearances in the media, the couple officially confirmed they’d split. photography via instagram.com/mommyhaileybaldwin December 2014: Bieber denies Hailey Baldwin dating rumours Jelena, what? We’re now onto Jailey. Talks that Bieber is dating model Hailey Baldwin are at a high. However, JB denies these rumours, assuring fans that they are simply good friends (whatever that means). photography via instagram.com/zedd January 2015: Gomez and Zedd dating rumours begin Shortly after the Jailey rumours came out, Gomez was seen getting close with DJ Zedd. This romance was not confirmed until later that year in September, when Gomez spoke with Elle for an interview. photography via instagram.com/selenamylight September 2015: Gomez opens up about Bieber in ELLE Gomez discusses her past relationship with her fellow pop star and states that she will always support him. photography via instagram.com/selgselgenator November 2015: Bieber appears on The Ellen DeGeneres Show In November 2015, JB stopped by Ellen, and while discussing his upcoming album Purpose, he revealed which songs were inspired by Selena—thanks for the intel, Biebs! The songs? Check out “What Do You Mean?” “Sorry” and “Mark My Words”. photography via instagram.com/haileybaldwin January 2016: Bieber and Baldwin hang out on New Year’s Eve Was it not recently that JB confirmed that he and Baldwin were just good friends? Yes, but now things appear to have changed. The two celebs took their romance public on Instagram. However, it’s unclear how long the this romance lasted, as they’ve since broken up. photography via instagram.com/sofiarichie August 2016: Sofia Richie posts an Instagram of her and Bieber Yes, Sofia Richie, daughter of Lionel Richie, and sister of Nicole Richie. Bieber and Richie both took to Instagram recently to post photos of their time in Japan. The comments on both their accounts proved one thing for sure: do not mess with Jelena fans. Photography via Instagram.com/selenagomez August 2016: Gomez posts a clip of her singing “Let Me Love You” So, just when we thought the dust had settled between Jelena, this clip surfaced of Gomez singing DJ Snake’s “Let Me Love You,” which features the Biebs on vocals. An official cover has yet to be released; however, suspicions that it’s coming soon have been heightened as DJ Snake posted a longer version of Gomez’s cover on his Snapchat. I think we can all agree that it’s a little odd of Selena to chose to cover her ex’s song after feuding over his new boo Sofia. But hey, you do you, Selena! photography via instagram.com/revivaltour November 2016: Bieber allegedly visits Gomez in rehab Gomez pulled out of her Revival Tour, in late August, due to complications caused by Lupus; mainly symptoms surrounding anxiety and panic. As a result, she checks in to rehab facility (feel better soon, Selena!). Rumours of Bieber visiting Gomez in rehab have started to circulate. Can somebody seriously loop us in, please?!

gossipcop-2388806885,1,"R. Kelly’s time may have finally come. R. Kelly has been accused of sexual relationships with minors going back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah. (The marriage was annulled.) In the 24 years since then, he has been sued multiple times for inappropriate sexual contact with a minor (he settled out of court every time), and he was eventually charged with creating child pornography. (A jury found him not guilty on the grounds that they could not conclusively identify the other figure in his infamous sex tape as a child.) Last summer, he was accused of creating an abusive “sex cult” of very young women, whom he allegedly isolates, brainwashes, and abuses physically and emotionally. Since the story broke, multiple women have added their own testimonies of abuse at R. Kelly’s hands. (Through a lawyer, Kelly denied all accusations, saying he would “work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.”) And in April, another woman accused Kelly of “knowingly and intentionally infecting her with an STD.” Her lawyers say they are currently preparing a federal civil lawsuit. Through a spokesperson, Kelly issued a statement to the Washington Post in which he “categorically denies all claims and allegations.” As man after man has fallen to the #MeToo reckoning, losing jobs and retiring from public life after being accused of sexual harassment and assault, there’s been a recurring whisper: What about R. Kelly? Despite decades of lawsuits and allegations, Kelly’s career has marched steadily on. Last year, he finished an arena tour with a few cancellations. This year, he’s touring with singer Charlie Wilson (some protests are planned). His music appeared in Pitch Perfect 3. At this year’s Coachella, rapper Vince Staples repeatedly referred to Kelly as a “child molester” in an interview with Complex, insisting, “He pees on people.” In our post-#MeToo, post-Time’s Up, post-Harvey Weinstein world, and given the sheer volume of allegations against Kelly, it seems reasonable to raise the question of why he continues to work as much as he does. But Staples’s interviewer only giggled nervously and protested, “We can’t ever talk about this guy. ... You’re about to get me fired from Coachella. It’s my first time here.” Later, Staples tweeted that “R. Kelly people is looking for me.” ladies and gentlemen, vince staples on r kelly pic.twitter.com/SmZdYu9PNJ — andy (@aboynamedandy) April 16, 2018 That stasis may be starting to change. Most of the claims against Kelly were reiterated in a recent BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes. And over the past year, at least five members of Kelly’s inner circle have left him. His assistant, his accountant, his lawyer, and his rep have all said that they no longer work for him, although none of them have gone into detail about their departures and all have been supportive and complimentary toward Kelly in their statements. His longtime musical accompanist, DJ Phantom, was less circumspect about his decision to leave Kelly in December: “I didn’t know then what I know now,” he said. “He’s a shitbag.” In April, the Women of Color committee within Time’s Up threw its weight behind the #MuteRKelly campaign, calling for anyone currently profiting from Kelly and his music to drop him, including Spotify, Ticketmaster, and Kelly’s record label, RCA. Shortly thereafter, Spotify announced that it would no longer be promoting Kelly’s music, although his music would remain in their streaming catalog. It’s possible that these new developlments mean things are changing for Kelly, and that he’s about to face lasting consequences for those accusations. But if that’s the case, those consequences took more than two decades to reach him. There is a persistent vagueness to the way we talk about R. Kelly that makes it possible to forget exactly what he’s been accused of, how often he’s been accused, and how much proof there is against him. And most likely, that’s because his alleged victims are overwhelmingly young black women and hence apparently easy for America to ignore. “The saddest fact I’ve learned is: Nobody matters less to our society than young black women,” says Jim DeRogatis, the reporter who broke the R. Kelly story. “Nobody.” To try to combat that vagueness and the erasure that it makes possible, here is a timeline of all of the accusations of sexual misconduct against R. Kelly. Much of the chronology here is drawn from DeRogatis’s invaluable coverage of the R. Kelly accusations, including his own immensely thorough timeline. DeRogatis’s timeline covers the entire span of Kelly’s life, including his major career milestones and unrelated legal issues, but I’ve narrowed the focus of this timeline to specifically the sexual misconduct accusations against Kelly. Over the 24-year span of this timeline, a consistent pattern emerges. Over and over again, Kelly is accused of the same behavior: of targeting girls and very young women, isolating them, and controlling and abusing them. And after the dust from the accusation settles, Kelly goes on living his life with very few changes. Here, from Aaliyah to the alleged sex cult, are all the R. Kelly accusations. August 30, 1994: 27-year-old R. Kelly marries 15-year-old Aaliyah The ’90s music sensation Aaliyah was Kelly’s protégé. They met when she was 12 years old, and Kelly wrote and produced her first album in 1993. It was titled Age Ain’t Nothing but a Number. In 1995, Vibe magazine published a copy of their marriage license, with 15-year-old Aaliyah falsely listing her age as 18. “Family members say Aaliyah thought it was all an elaborate ‘game,’ and she just went along with it,” the Chicago Sun-Times later reported, adding that the marriage license was reportedly obtained by Kelly’s assistant, using a fake ID. “Within hours, she realized what had happened, and she went to her family and sought their help.” The marriage was annulled in 1994, just months after the ceremony.

Hawkins’s lawsuit was reportedly settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. 1998: Another lawsuit, another settlement In 1998, a 20-year-old woman named Patrice Jones accused Kelly of sexual battery and emotional distress. The lawsuit was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. 2000: Chicago Sun-Times reports on allegations against Kelly In 2000, the Chicago Sun-Times published a lengthy investigation into the allegations against Kelly, including accusations from multiple women of sexual misconduct and statutory rape. One of the women, a 17-year-old high school student, alleged that Kelly had “lured” her into a sexual relationship with him and that he had “frequently” sexually assaulted her. 2001: Aaliyah’s mother speaks out Dannie Hewitt, Aaliyah’s mother, spoke to the Sun-Times about her daughter’s marriage to Kelly. “I knew that they were intimate. I knew that he was very controlling. I knew that she couldn’t do anything without him. I knew that she was totally under his thumb,” she said. 2002: Kelly accused of child pornography In 2002, a video emerged of Kelly allegedly having sex with a 14-year-old girl. The video was sent to the Chicago Police Department, and Kelly was arrested and charged with child pornography. In 2008, a jury found Kelly not guilty, ruling that the video was not conclusive evidence that the girl in question was underage. 2015: Allegations of a “sex cult” emerge In 2015, a woman named Lizzette Martinez told the Daily Beast that she had been a member of Kelly’s “sex cult” for several years. She alleged that Kelly had “groomed” her for a sexual relationship starting when she was 17 years old, and that she had been subjected to physical and emotional abuse. 2017: BuzzFeed reports on “cult” allegations In 2017, BuzzFeed News reported on allegations from several women who accused Kelly of running a “sex cult” that included multiple very young women. One woman, Jerhonda Pace, alleged that she had been forced to have sex with Kelly and that he had also filmed her without her consent. 2018: More allegations, and a #MuteRKelly campaign In April 2018, the #MuteRKelly campaign was launched, calling for a boycott of Kelly’s music and for his record label, RCA, to drop him. The campaign was sparked by a BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes, which reiterated many of the allegations against Kelly. In response to the campaign, Kelly’s lawyer issued a statement saying that he “categorically denies all claims and allegations.” 2018: New allegations, from a woman who says Kelly infected her with an STD In April 2018, a woman named Faith Rodgers accused Kelly of knowingly and intentionally infecting her with a sexually transmitted disease. Rodgers said that she had met Kelly at a concert in 2017, when she was 19 years old, and that he had pursued a sexual relationship with her. Her lawyers say they are currently preparing a federal civil lawsuit.

gossipcop-9447768564,1,"Justin Bieber’s struggling with his split from Selena Gomez as she’s all smiles on her Australian vacation, a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Here’s how the Biebs is coping with his time apart from Sel.  Justin Bieber, 24, is going through a tough time as his relationship with Selena Gomez, 25, is on pause. She’s currently on vacation with friends in Sydney, Australia, where she appears to be carefree in this new video. However, a source reveals that the same can’t be said for Bieber. “Justin has Selena on the brain constantly. He is trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time but he keeps thinking about her,” a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “He always wants to be around her, talk to her and be with her. She is like a drug for him, he just needs more and more and more.”  As the Biebs continues to struggle with their time apart, he’s got a few things up his sleeve for when she returns to LA. “He can’t wait until she is back because he wants to really wine and dine her upon her return and really kick start the relationship back up again,” the insider reveals. It’s unclear when Sel is scheduled to return to the West Coast. But, as seen on her Instagram, she is having the time of her life. She posted a video which showed her laughing on a boat, accompanied by a subliminal message, that she “chose” to take care of herself, “not to prove anything to anyone.” Was she trying to give us insight into her most recent split with Bieber?  Jelena fans went into panic mode after seeing Sel in the arms of another man on a boat on March 19. She was photographed hugging and goofing off in photos with Sydney native, Johnny Rays. While all signs point to a friendship between the two, the photos didn’t appear that way to some fans who claimed they looked too close for comfort.  While Sel has been vacationing Down Under, Bieber has been staying active. He’s been photographed playing hockey and soccer with friends. However, his emotions may be getting the best of him as he took a gnarly fall during a soccer game on March 19, and seemingly broke down on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.  As you may recall, Jelena reunited in October 2017, after her split with The Weeknd, 28. They seemed inseparable, having spent New Year’s together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, their romance took a rocky turn around Bieber’s birthday on March 1, according to reports.","You are a journalist. Given a 'passage', please paraphrase it. Do not generate any other word. The 'passage' is: ","Justin Bieber’s struggling with his split from Selena Gomez as she’s all smiles on her Australian vacation, a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Here’s how the Biebs is coping with his time apart from Sel.  Justin Bieber, 24, is going through a tough time as his relationship with Selena Gomez, 25, is on pause. She’s currently on vacation with friends in Sydney, Australia, where she appears to be carefree in this new video. However, a source reveals that the same can’t be said for Bieber. “Justin has Selena on the brain constantly. He is trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time but he keeps thinking about her,” a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “He always wants to be around her, talk to her and be with her. She is like a drug for him, he just needs more and more and more.”  As the Biebs continues to struggle with their time apart, he’s got a few things up his sleeve for when she returns to LA. “He can’t wait until she is back because he wants to really wine and dine her upon her return and really kick start the relationship back up again,” the insider reveals. It’s unclear when Sel is scheduled to return to the West Coast. But, as seen on her Instagram, she is having the time of her life. She posted a video which showed her laughing on a boat, accompanied by a subliminal message, that she “chose” to take care of herself, “not to prove anything to anyone.” Was she trying to give us insight into her most recent split with Bieber?  Jelena fans went into panic mode after seeing Sel in the arms of another man on a boat on March 19. She was photographed hugging and goofing off in photos with Sydney native, Johnny Rays. While all signs point to a friendship between the two, the photos didn’t appear that way to some fans who claimed they looked too close for comfort.  While Sel has been vacationing Down Under, Bieber has been staying active. He’s been photographed playing hockey and soccer with friends. However, his emotions may be getting the best of him as he took a gnarly fall during a soccer game on March 19, and seemingly broke down on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.  As you may recall, Jelena reunited in October 2017, after her split with The Weeknd, 28. They seemed inseparable, having spent New Year’s together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, their romance took a rocky turn around Bieber’s birthday on March 1, according to reports.","A source close to the couple previously revealed to us that the split happened because of Selena’s concerns over Justin’s behavior and friends. “Selena is really upset with Justin. She thinks he’s been acting out of control and it’s not a healthy situation for her to be in,” the source told us EXCLUSIVELY. “She wants to see him get help for his issues and work on himself before they can get back together.”  Despite their current split, a reconciliation is still possible. “Justin still cares deeply for Selena and is hoping that she will take him back once he’s proven that he’s changed,” our source shared.

gossipcop-28284230,1,"Not so fast! Madonna was hit with a series of “uncomfortable questions” by a judge before she was granted permission to adopt her 4-year-old twin girls from Malawi, the presiding judge said in court documents obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, February 8.  “The petitioner is a professional performer and I guarded myself against the danger of her merely reciting a well-rehearsed speech by asking her some rather uncomfortable questions to which she gave very candid answers,” Judge Fiona Mwale said in her ruling, explaining her reasons for approving the adoption.  After pressing Madonna, 58, to explain her intentions in adding two more little ones to her brood of four, Judge Mwale said she was satisfied that the girls would be in good hands with the Material Girl.  “There is no doubt that the petitioner can offer the infants not only the best education money can buy, but also guidance with a high likelihood of ensuring that the two infants grow to be self-sufficient adults,” Judge Mwale said, adding that she is satisfied that Madonna “is motivated by her desire to offer a home, love, protection and guidance to the infants.”  In the court documents, Judge Mwale addressed prior controversies surrounding Madonna’s adoptions in Malawi. “In determining her motives, I questioned the petitioner at length about the impact of her decision which could be construed as robbing Malawi of its most precious resource, its children,” the judge wrote.  As previously reported, Madonna filed for adoption in High Court in Malawi on January 25 but tried to keep the process under wraps until a final decision was made. (The Queen of Pop issued a statement denying her adoption to Us Weekly that same day, claiming that she was in Malawi “to check on the children’s hospital in Blantyre.”) According to the AP, she has already raised $7.5 million for a pediatric surgery ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, which is set to open early next year.  Madonna previously adopted son David and daughter Mercy James, both 11, from Malawi in 2008 and 2009, respectively. She is also mom to daughter Lourdes, 20, whom she shares with ex Carlos Leon, and son Rocco, 16, whom she shares with ex-husband Guy Ritchie.  Madonna’s twin girls will retain their birth names as a part of an effort to preserve their identity as Malawian nationals, the court documents said, and their father was at the January 25 court hearing with Madonna. (The twins’ mother died within a week of childbirth due to health complications.)  On Wednesday, February 8, Madonna took to social media to share the happy news. “I can officially confirm I have completed the process of adopting twin sisters from Malawi and am overjoyed that they are now part of our family,” she captioned an image of herself walking between the two little girls. “I am deeply grateful to all those in Malawi who helped make this possible, and I ask the media please to respect our privacy during this transitional time. 🙏🏻 Thank you also to my friends, family and my very large team for all your support and Love!”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

The moral of the story is that, despite Swift’s undeniable talent, her newfound persona is, at the very least, alienating her most loyal fan base.",paraphrase_generation

gossipcop-6225895099,1,"Chris Soules, former star of ABC’s “The Bachelor,” after his arrest. (Buchanan County Sheriff via AP) Iowa farmer Chris Soules, a former star on ABC’s “The Bachelor” who charmed reality TV viewers with his small-town life, was arrested this week after police said he fled a crash that killed a fellow farmer. Soules, 35, was charged with leaving the scene of a fatal crash, a class D felony, and could face up to five years in prison if he is convicted. The case has garnered the attention of Soules’s “Bachelor” fans as well as residents of Arlington, Iowa, where he lives, who had come to appreciate the reality TV star’s work as an unofficial Iowa ambassador and farm industry advocate. “This story is going to spread like wildfire around here and probably all over because of who he is,” Mary Jo Brown, Arlington’s city clerk, told the Des Moines Register. “Sometimes fame isn’t your friend.” Soules, who also appeared in “Dancing with the Stars” and “Worst Chefs in America,” called 911 at 8:20 p.m. Monday evening to report that he had rear-ended a tractor on a rural road north of the tiny town of Aurora, about six miles away from his home. The tractor veered into a ditch after being struck by his 2008 Chevrolet Silverado, Soules said. The tractor driver — later identified as 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, a Vietnam War veteran — was unconscious and not breathing, Soules told the 911 operator, according to audio obtained by local media. The man had a pulse, but there was blood around his mouth, Soules said. Soules identified himself on the call, which lasted nearly six minutes, and sounded frantic. Between heavy breathing, he answered the dispatcher’s questions and took instructions. Soules told the 911 operator he did not know how to perform CPR and could be heard asking unidentified people at the scene if they could perform the lifesaving measure. The call ended abruptly after the operator told Soules law enforcement and medical first responders were on the way. “Can I, can I call you back really quick?” Soules asked the dispatcher. “Yeah, you can call me back,” she says. “Thank you,” Soules responds. Soules left the crash site after emergency responders arrived, but before deputies with the Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office were on the scene, according to authorities. Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Scott Bright told the Des Moines Register that Soules fled the scene on foot and later got into a truck. In police audio obtained by local media, a deputy told a dispatcher that Soules “took off” in a red truck. Authorities are trying to identify who picked up Soules in the truck, Buchanan County Sheriff Bill Wolfgram told the Associated Press. That person could face charges, he said. Alcohol was found at the scene and investigators are trying to determine whose it was and whether it or speed were factors in the crash. Soules was arrested about five hours after the incident and booked into the Buchanan County Jail, the Associated Press reported. He posted a $10,000 bond Tuesday morning and was released on the condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic monitor. During his first appearance in court, the Buchanan County assistant attorney told the judge that Soules refused to cooperate with law enforcement after they located him at his home. He “would not come out,” the attorney said, until officials obtained a search warrant, which “took hours.” Chris Soules making his initial court appearance in Buchanan County @KWWL pic.twitter.com/72bvEg0wVR — Elizabeth Amanieh (@EAmaniehKWWL) April 25, 2017 Wolfgram told the Associated Press that investigators were “running into some roadblocks when it comes to getting information” but acknowledged Soules was acting within his constitutional rights. According to court documents, Soules had several run-ins with the law in his early 20s. In 2011, he was charged three times with underage alcohol possession and pleaded guilty and paid a fine for an open container violation, reported the Des Moines Register. The following year, he received three citations for fighting and noise, unlawful use of a license and leaving the scene, which was amended down to defective brakes, court documents showed. Then in 2005, Soules was charged with driving while intoxicated and received one year of probation. A statement from Soules’s publicist earlier this week said he was “devastated” to learn that Mosher had died from the crash and that his “thoughts and prayers” were with the man’s family. Mosher, a lifelong resident of Aurora — population 200 — lived on his family farm near the crash site, reported the Argus Leader. He was married to his high school sweetheart, Nancy, and the couple had two sons and three grandchildren, according to Mosher’s obituary. An Army veteran, Mosher served six years, including a tour in Vietnam. He farmed his entire life and was a member of the Aurora American Legion and the Iowa Corn Growers Association. “Kenny loved playing golf, farming and spending his winters in Florida biking and visiting his mother,” Mosher’s obituary said. “His family was most important to him, especially his grandchildren.” In northeast Iowa, where Mosher and Soules both farmed, community members told local media they were heartbroken for the families of both men.

He was a fan favorite, making it to the final three before bachelorette Andi Dorfman sent him home. Soules — nicknamed “Farmer Chris” — later returned as the star of his own season. He proposed to Whitney Bischoff, a contestant from Chicago, but the two split after a brief engagement. He later competed on “Dancing with the Stars” and the Food Network’s “Worst Chefs in America.” Soules has since made guest appearances on various “Bachelor” franchise spin-offs shows and was rumored to be a cast member for this summer’s taping of “Bachelor in Paradise,” where former contestants search for love on","You are a journalist.

gossipcop-8342414455,1,"Forget Wills and Kate's dusty old Norfolk. The lovebirds want to hang out with the groovy set in the Cotswolds - and the local estate agents' eyes are lighting up. There comes a time in every couple's relationship when the question of moving in together becomes impossible to ignore. And when those two lovebirds have been stepping out for 15 months — even though they live 3,500 miles apart; he in the UK, she in Canada — it's not so much a case of 'if' as of 'when' they will settle down. So it comes as no surprise that Prince Harry, 33, and his actress girlfriend Meghan Markle, 36, are said to be house-hunting. £7.25million - North Aston Manor, Oxfordshire: This eight bedroom property, overlooking the stunning Cherwell Valley, has seven reception rooms, a spa, swimming pool and 18.2 acres with equestrian facilities. It's nine miles from Soho Farmhouse and swanky shopping centre Bicester Village, should Meghan fancy snapping up some designer bargains Prince Harry and actress girlfriend Meghan Markle were pictured together at the Invictus Games in Toronto last month Royal sources have exclusively told the Daily Mail that the royal couple are looking in Oxfordshire and are particularly interested in high-end properties tucked away in the rolling Cotswold hills. A good friend of Harry's says the Prince, whose father's residence, Highgrove House, is in the south Cotswolds, has a long-standing affection for the area, while Meghan is said to be entranced by its rustic charm. 'He is searching for a new home in the area,' the friend reveals. 'Before Meghan, he was vaguely looking in Norfolk, but didn't find what he wanted. Now, with her input, he's renewed his search.' £2million - The Old Rectory, Lower Brailes, Oxfordshire: A stunning wood-panelled property dating from the 14th century, this boasts eight bedrooms, a sun-drenched terrace and its own private lake, complete with duck house. There’s a three-bedroom coach house for guests and it’s set at the end of a no-through road. Certainly, the lush green countryside encompassing swathes of Warwickshire, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire is a huge draw for London-dwellers eager to snap up rural boltholes. Just an hour or so from the capital, it's home (or at least a weekend retreat) to A-listers, politicians and media executives: the Camerons, Beckhams, Kate Moss, Lily Allen and Stella McCartney all have million-pound properties in the area. 'It's like a magnet,' says Sophie Gannon, of Savills Estate Agents in Banbury, Oxfordshire. 'If you get one person, you get them all.' However, Harry isn't following the crowd but listening to his heart. The Cotswolds, and specifically Highgrove, which was bought by his father's private estate in 1980, is where the Prince spent much of his childhood. It was Charles and Diana's weekend home, with 15-acre grounds and, later on, a teenage haven in the cellars of the main house, which Harry nicknamed 'Club H'. £2.95million - Fanthill, Banbury, Oxfordshire: Accessed through electric gates, up a winding driveway, this eight-bedroom house sits among 20 acres of land, so ticks all Harry’s boxes when it comes to privacy. There’s a heated outdoor pool, miniature golf course and a carp lake, where the young lovebirds could row off the private pier A local who knows the family says: 'It's not surprising that Harry would like to live where he feels at home. 'He's lived in the Cotswolds all his life and often returns to visit his father. After his mother died, it became a place of sanctuary. 'When the boys entered their teens, Charles bought several homes in the area, thinking they might want one in the future.' Ten years ago, Charles bought up properties adjacent to his sprawling estate, paying £2 million apiece for nearby manor houses and farm buildings. But sources say rather than living off his father's generosity, Harry wants to invest in a place of his own. £4.25million - Cross Hill House, Adderbury, Oxfordshire: This 10-bedroom house, surrounded by landscaped gardens, is eight miles from Soho Farmhouse. There are ample stables in the grounds as well as a reassuringly private Victorian walled garden. The centrepiece of the house is a huge open-plan sitting and dining room He has friends and relatives dotted across the Cotswolds, an area estate agents dub the 'Royal Triangle'. Cousin Zara, her rugby-player husband Mike Tindall and their daughter Mia, three, live six miles from Highgrove in a cottage at Gatcombe Park, Princess Anne's country estate. The Beckham brood, of whom the Prince is very fond, have been renovating a £5 million plot on the 4,000-acre Great Tew Estate in Chipping Norton since 2015. Palace insiders say it's this tight-knit circle of friends that has prompted the couple to focus their search on the Cotswolds rather than Norfolk, where William and Kate rule the roost at Anmer Hall, a grand Georgian pile boasting a swimming pool and tennis court. 'They don't want to be second-runners to Kate and William,' one source says. Locals have spotted the Prince — without his girlfriend — discreetly checking out several Cotswolds hotspots in recent months. The blacked-out Range Rovers driven by royal protection officers have been spotted navigating the country lanes around Cirencester and Stow-on-the-Wold, while Harry has apparently been sipping pints of bitter in low-key village pubs. £7.75million - Luckington Court, Chippenham, Wiltshire: This 11th-century house with original Tudor features is set in 157 acres of woodland and pasture, surrounded by a secure fence. There are eight bedrooms, four reception rooms, two kitchens, a music room, study and plenty of space for staff — a must for any royal retreat 'I'm not surprised he's moving here — he's in the local quite often,' says one resident.

It’s no secret that Jennifer Lopez-at 48-has a body that won’t quit and skin that needs to be studied so we can all age like the goddess she is.  Dramatic? Not even close.  And while a lot of it may be down to great genes, Lopez has revealed in a new interview some of her beauty secrets and yep, they’re as diva as you might expect.  Lopez credits her glow to positive affirmations, revealing she says one in particular to herself every day to keep her radiant, youthful look intact.  So what is this magic phrase?  “I am youthful and timeless at every age,” Lopez says every single day—but it’s not enough to just say the mantra daily, because Lopez also has a handful of pillows with these words and more mantras embroidered into them all over her home. “I tell myself that every day, a few times a day. It sounds like clichéd bullshit, but it’s not: Age is all in your mind. Look at Jane Fonda.”  Lopez continues, “The affirmations are everywhere. I forget that they’re all here. They’re just part of the house now.”  Before you scoff at Lopez’s positivity there is a school of thought that believes negative thoughts can age you.

The book asserts there is a correlation between depression and anxiety and shorter telomeres and that “when pessimists develop an aging-related illness, like cancer or heart disease, the illness tends to progress faster.”  And really there's only so far a little highlight can go, step one is all about a positive attitude. Step two is to find yourself a great pillowcase and settle on your new mantra.  So what’s the lesson here? Your inner glow is only a glass half full attitude away.","You are a journalist.

gossipcop-4678149709,1,"Since separating from Channing Tatum in April, Jenna Dewan has put a cheery spin on the end of their nine-year marriage. “I feel I’ve been on a wave of growth,” Jenna said recently. “It’s OK for a relationship to change into a new form that is actually better for both people involved, and I think that’s maybe what shocked everyone so much — that it can be a positive thing.”  But it's apparently not so positive anymore. Each time Channing and Jenna head to mediation to discuss the terms of their divorce, “they can’t seem to agree on anything,” says a source. “Their meetings have been contentious.” One big issue: their five-year-old daughter, Everly. “They can’t agree on custody,” a friend tells In Touch exclusively.      Unicorns do exist. A post shared by Channing Tatum (@channingtatum) on May 4, 2018 at 6:40pm PDT      “They’re both working hard to do what’s in the best interest of their daughter, but it’s just taking way longer than they both expected because they can’t agree on the small details.” Another sticking point: Channing’s estimated $60 million fortune. Though Jenna, 37, has had a successful movie and TV career with shows like Supergirl, Channing, 38, has starred in several blockbusters, such as Magic Mike and 21 Jump Street, and was the family’s main breadwinner. “Jenna has told friends that she gave Channing the best years of her life,” says the source, “and now she’s trying to negotiate a very secure future for herself.”  There is a lot at stake financially. During the course of their marriage, the pair acquired several assets, including a $6 million Beverly Hills home and pricey cars including a Tesla and a vintage Chevrolet truck. Finding common ground about dividing their stuff “is not easy,” says the friend. “They both want it to be over with.”          Jenna never thought it would come to this. “She isn’t pleased about how it’s all played out so far,” says the source. “She’s bitter. There are days when she’s blaming him for not working harder to save their marriage.” And while she’s told pals that she hopes they can stay friends, adds the source, deep down “she knows that’s never going to happen.”  Channing shouldn’t underestimate Jenna, says the source: “She’s looking out for herself, and at the end of the day she knows that he’s got to pay. She’s not going to walk away quietly.”  For more on this, pick up the latest issue of In Touch — and for more exclusive content sign up for our newsletter.

A post shared by Channing Tatum (@channingtatum) on May 4, 2018 at 6:40pm PDT      “They’re both working hard to do what’s in the best interest of their daughter, but it’s just taking way longer than they both expected because they can’t agree on the small details.” Another sticking point: Channing’s estimated $60 million fortune. Though Jenna, 37, has had a successful movie and TV career with shows like Supergirl, Channing, 38, has starred in several blockbusters, such as Magic Mike and 21 Jump Street, and was the family’s main breadwinner. “Jenna has told friends that she gave Channing the best years of her life,” says the source, “and now she’s trying to negotiate a very secure future for herself.”  There is a lot at stake financially. During the course of their marriage, the pair acquired several assets, including a $6 million Beverly Hills home and pricey cars including a Tesla and a vintage Chevrolet truck. Finding common ground about dividing their stuff “is not easy,” says the friend. “They both want it to be over with.”          Jenna never thought it would come to this. “She isn’t pleased about how it’s all played out so far,” says the source. “She’s bitter. There are days when she’s blaming him for not working harder to save their marriage.” And while she’s told pals that she hopes they can stay friends, adds the source, deep down “she knows that’s never going to happen.”  Channing shouldn’t underestimate Jenna, says the source: “She’s looking out for herself, and at the end of the day she knows that he’s got to pay. She’s not going to walk away quietly.”  For more on this, pick up the latest issue of In Touch — and for more exclusive content sign up for our newsletter.

Chyna confirmed the news on Instagram, sharing a photo of her manicured nails resting on Rob’s tattooed arm. The couple quickly got serious, moving in together and even talking babies. Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa Feud The same month that Chyna and Rob started dating, West and Khalifa began feuding on Twitter. It all started when West announced that his new album would be titled Waves, the same name of Khalifa’s 2015 album. Khalifa took to Twitter to express his frustration, writing, “Please don’t take the wave.” West fired back with a series of tweets, including one that read, “You have distracted the kid, everyone wanted to work with the kid because I made it so cool. Now go get ya own waves.” The beef only got bigger from there. Kanye West Calls Out Amber Rose on Twitter West joined the Twitter fray when he tweeted, “A wolf in sheep’s clothing is still a wolf,” which many fans took as a dig at Rose. When a follower asked West if he was talking about his ex, he replied, “I’m not sure what’s going on but 1 thing I know for sure is that my wife is the most amazing woman in the world.” Amber Rose Fires Back at Kanye West In response to West’s tweets, Rose tweeted, “@kanyewest This is my responds to Kanye’s shade. I’m always respectful. pic.twitter.com/uWhlZyp3jI” and included a photo of herself looking unbothered. Kanye West Apologizes to Wiz Khalifa After several days of public feuding, West tweeted an apology to Khalifa. “I apologize for my misunderstanding of your tweets and for my over-reaction,” West wrote. “I’m just glad that we could talk it out and squash the beef. We’re all good.” The same day, West also tweeted an apology to Amber Rose, writing, “My apologies to Amber also. I’m still learning how to communicate correctly.”

gossipcop-9639077061,1,"Ivanka Trump is becoming one of the most powerful first children in American History – despite not having an official job in the Trump administration. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Ivanka Trump’s products weren’t always the hottest items online. In January, for instance, the first daughter’s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes. That changed dramatically the following month. Sales of Trump’s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst’s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before. Yes, Feb. 9 — the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump’s clothing and jewelry line on “Fox & Friends.” “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would tell you,” Conway said. “I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.” And viewers did, apparently. Sales of Ivanka Trump’s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst) Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that “the beginning of February” shows “the best performing weeks in the history of the brand.” “For several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,” Klem said. Sarah Tanner, Lyst’s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton’s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter’s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company. Conway has come under fire for touting Ivanka Trump's clothing line during a televised interview. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) [A Trump wine boycott backfires spectacularly] But the brand was “largely featured” in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump’s brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had “been treated so unfairly” by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales. “It would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,” Tanner said of Conway’s Fox interview. “I think that’s one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.” Conway did not respond to an email requesting comment. Her promotion of the fashion line appeared to violate an ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products and immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. [Where does the Ivanka Trump brand go from here?] Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Conway’s comments were “absolutely wrong, wrong, wrong” and “clearly over the line,” The Washington Post reported. The White House later said that Conway had been “counseled.” But concerns about her comments remain. On Thursday, the government’s top ethics official criticized the White House for not disciplining Conway, The Post’s Drew Harwell reported. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, had urged officials last month to reprimand the White House counsel but was rebuffed. On Thursday he wrote to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues as the president’s deputy counsel. “When an employee’s conduct violates, disciplinary action serves to deter future misconduct,” Shaub wrote. “Not taking disciplinary action against a senior official under such circumstances risks undermining the ethics program.” [A Trump voter’s message to retailers: ‘Keep your mouths shut about our president’] Last month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway — a law school graduate and member of the D.C. Bar — partly because of her on-air endorsement of Trump’s products. According to Lyst, February drew unusually large numbers of orders across many Ivanka Trump-branded products, including dresses, shoes, pants, coats, knitwear and tops. Heels were the bestsellers, followed by dresses. “We’ve never seen such a large uptick,” Tanner said. “Typically, she’s not in our top 100 sellers.” Comparing February’s numbers with last year’s average number of orders of Ivanka Trump products shows a difference of 557 percent. (Tanner said company policy prohibits her from sharing the actual numbers of online sales.) The excitement of the brand, however, may be slumping. The company’s numbers show sales were gradually tapering off toward the end of February. March does not appear to be as remarkable, but sales are still on track to be about 8 percent better than they were in January, according to Lyst. [Watchdogs ask U.S. attorney to investigate Trump over foreign business deals] The Ivanka Trump brand also appears to have weathered an aggressive boycott campaign called Grab Your Wallet, which began in October and encouraged shoppers to avoid retailers that stock Trump-branded products. 1 of 68 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Ivanka Trump: A life in the spotlight View Photos Here’s a look at Ivanka Trump’s early life of privilege and transformation into a business executive, first daughter and adviser to the U.S. president.

Some retailers have partially or completely distanced themselves from the Trump brand. Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and Belk have stopped selling Trump’s branded line of clothing, shoes and jewelry. T.J.

That changed dramatically the following month. Sales of Trump’s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst’s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before. Yes, Feb. 9 — the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump’s clothing and jewelry line on “Fox & Friends.” “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would tell you,” Conway said. “I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.” And viewers did, apparently. Sales of Ivanka Trump’s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst) Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that “the beginning of February” shows “the best performing weeks in the history of the brand.” “For several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,” Klem said. Sarah Tanner, Lyst’s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton’s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter’s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company. Conway has come under fire for touting Ivanka Trump's clothing line during a televised interview. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) [A Trump wine boycott backfires spectacularly] But the brand was “largely featured” in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump’s brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had “been treated so unfairly” by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales. “It would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,” Tanner said of Conway’s Fox interview. “I think that’s one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.” Conway did not respond to an email requesting comment. Her promotion of the fashion line appeared to violate an ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products and immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. [Where does the Ivanka Trump brand go from here?] Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Conway’s comments were “absolutely wrong, wrong, wrong” and “clearly over the line,” The Washington Post reported. The White House later said that Conway had been “counseled.” But concerns about her comments remain. On Thursday, the government’s top ethics official criticized the White House for not disciplining Conway, The Post’s Drew Harwell reported. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, had urged officials last month to reprimand the White House counsel but was rebuffed. On Thursday he wrote to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues as the president’s deputy counsel. “When an employee’s conduct violates, disciplinary action serves to deter future misconduct,” Shaub wrote. “Not taking disciplinary action against a senior official under such circumstances risks undermining the ethics program.” [A Trump voter’s message to retailers: ‘Keep your mouths shut about our president’] Last month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway — a law school graduate and member of the D.C. Bar — partly because of her on-air endorsement of Trump’s products. According to Lyst, February drew unusually large numbers of orders across many Ivanka Trump-branded products, including dresses, shoes, pants, coats, knitwear and tops. Heels were the bestsellers, followed by dresses. “We’ve never seen such a large uptick,” Tanner said. “Typically, she’s not in our top 100 sellers.” Comparing February’s numbers with last year’s average number of orders of Ivanka Trump products shows a difference of 557 percent. (Tanner said company policy prohibits her from sharing the actual numbers of online sales.) The excitement of the brand, however, may be slumping. The company’s numbers show sales were gradually tapering off toward the end of February. March does not appear to be as remarkable, but sales are still on track to be about 8 percent better than they were in January, according to Lyst.

Some retailers have partially or completely distanced themselves from the Trump brand. Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and Belk have stopped selling Trump’s branded line of clothing, shoes and jewelry. T.J. Maxx and Marshalls have instructed employees to stop promoting Trump products in stores and to move Trump clothing into general merchandise racks. Sears Holdings and subsidiary Kmart discontinued online sales of 31 items from the Trump Home collection last month, though their websites still contain items sold by third-party sellers.","(Lyst does not track those sales.) Macy’s, Dillard’s and Amazon still carry Trump-branded products. Grab Your Wallet’s organizers say they have been successful in getting retailers to drop Trump brands. The group’s Facebook page has more than 172,000 followers. A spokesperson for Nordstrom said the retailer made the decision to drop Ivanka Trump’s line because of “poor sales performance.” The company said it sold through less than 10 percent of its inventory during the fall and holiday seasons. The company has said it will continue to focus on brands that resonate with customers. The retailer, however, has taken heat from Trump supporters who have called for a boycott of the chain. The Grab Your Wallet campaign also has encouraged supporters to shop at retailers that do not carry Trump brands. [Ivanka Trump’s brand is being hurt by her father’s presidency, data shows] In an email, Shannon Coulter, one of the campaign’s organizers, said that while she was pleased with the sales spike that followed Conway’s endorsement, it did not change her view that the brand should be boycotted. “The Ivanka Trump brand is still complicit in profiting off the Trump name and the presidency,” Coulter said. “And by extension, it’s profiting off the harmful policies and actions of this administration.” Despite the surge in sales, the Ivanka Trump brand is not out of the woods. Last week, data analytics firm Slice Intelligence reported that sales of Ivanka Trump’s branded products have been steadily declining since her father’s election. Sales were down 71 percent in January and February compared with the same period last year, the firm found. The brand’s sales began to tank in November, when her father was elected, and have not recovered.",paraphrase_generation

gossipcop-2194660040,1,"First Lady Melania Trump claims there is a secret poisoner in the White House and fears her husband is being slowly poisoned with “heavy sedatives” smuggled into his drinks in an attempt to slow him down, control him, and discredit his presidency, according to reports.  While public debate rages about Donald Trump’s health, Melania has told friends and associates that the once robust and high energy man she knew and loved has been replaced with a “slower, damaged version”.  “By 8pm he is slurring,” she said. “This is not the man I know.”  Fearing that the sedatives are being pumped into the body of the POTUS via Coca-Cola that he orders by pressing a button he had installed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Melania has insisted he stop drinking from the tap and instead revert to drinking from cans she brings herself.  “Donald’s heath improved out of sight when he stopped drinking from the tap,” Melania said.  However the First Lady fears the active campaign to poison the president is “a high level operation” and “not the work of a solitary loon.”  Melania is popular in the White House—as she is with the rest of the country—and she has befriended senior intelligence agency staff who remain loyal to president. They have educated her about Ronald Regan’s poisoning by the Deep State after his assassination attempt in 1981. They have also warned her that George W. Bush was reduced to a “brain damaged” state after years of steady poisoning.  But the advantage Trump may hold over his GOP predecessors in the Oval Office is that he has a wife who is wise to the ruse and is insisting he watch his food and drink intake closely for signs of adulteration.  Donald Trump’s food choices say a lot about the man. The president’s Howard Hughes-level pickiness when it comes to food is partly motivated by a desire to avoid being poisoned, according to Melania. He doesn’t trust those around him – and rightfully so.  As President Trump knows all too well, there are enemies of the state dug in deep at the White House.  Reporters from TIME recently got a glimpse behind-the-scenes at the White House, where they reported on what goes down at the president’s dinner table. Of particular interest was a meal enjoyed by the reporters, Trump, and Vice President Pence.  Pence’s meal was not unusual—he ate what everyone else did. But the POTUS received a meal fully customized to his own preferences, and closely observed by Melania who insisted on watching the chef prepare the meal with ingredients she provided herself.","You are a journalist.

While public debate rages about Donald Trump’s health, Melania has told friends and associates that the once robust and high energy man she knew and loved has been replaced with a “slower, damaged version”.  “By 8pm he is slurring,” she said. “This is not the man I know.”  Fearing that the sedatives are being pumped into the body of the POTUS via Coca-Cola that he orders by pressing a button he had installed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Melania has insisted he stop drinking from the tap and instead revert to drinking from cans she brings herself.  “Donald’s heath improved out of sight when he stopped drinking from the tap,” Melania said.  However the First Lady fears the active campaign to poison the president is “a high level operation” and “not the work of a solitary loon.”  Melania is popular in the White House—as she is with the rest of the country—and she has befriended senior intelligence agency staff who remain loyal to president. They have educated her about Ronald Regan’s poisoning by the Deep State after his assassination attempt in 1981. They have also warned her that George W. Bush was reduced to a “brain damaged” state after years of steady poisoning.  But the advantage Trump may hold over his GOP predecessors in the Oval Office is that he has a wife who is wise to the ruse and is insisting he watch his food and drink intake closely for signs of adulteration.  Donald Trump’s food choices say a lot about the man. The president’s Howard Hughes-level pickiness when it comes to food is partly motivated by a desire to avoid being poisoned, according to Melania. He doesn’t trust those around him – and rightfully so.  As President Trump knows all too well, there are enemies of the state dug in deep at the White House.  Reporters from TIME recently got a glimpse behind-the-scenes at the White House, where they reported on what goes down at the president’s dinner table. Of particular interest was a meal enjoyed by the reporters, Trump, and Vice President Pence.  Pence’s meal was not unusual—he ate what everyone else did. But the POTUS received a meal fully customized to his own preferences, and closely observed by Melania who insisted on watching the chef prepare the meal with ingredients she provided herself.","The President does not trust the staff at the White House and fears that they may poison him.  According to a report by Vanity Fair, Trump’s food is prepared by a personal chef, but only if his wife, Melania, is present to oversee the preparation.  Melania Trump is worried that her husband is being slowly poisoned by people in the White House who are trying to discredit his presidency. She thinks that someone is putting heavy sedatives in his drinks, especially in his Coca-Cola, which he orders from a button on his desk. She has told friends and associates that the President is not the same man she knew before and that by 8 pm, he is slurring his words. She has taken steps to make sure he stops drinking from the tap and instead drinks from cans that she brings herself. Melania is well-liked in the White House, and she has befriended senior intelligence agency staff who have warned her about previous attempts to poison presidents, such as Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. She is watching her husband's food and drink intake closely and making sure that he is aware of the potential danger. The President's pickiness when it comes to food is partly due to his desire to avoid being poisoned. The First Lady's efforts may give Trump an advantage over his predecessors, who were not aware of the potential danger.",paraphrase_generation

The action star has steadily starred in film after film, yet has been at the center of several dating rumors.  As the International Business Times reports, “The actor was mistakenly linked to an Australian journalist and then was associated to his Mission: Impossible 6 co-star and Crown actress Vanessa Kirby.”  All rumors until now have been stamped out as false.  However, the latest claims include those stating that members of the Church of Scientology have once again been playing matchmaker for the Top Gun star and that Cruise has reportedly been secretly dating over the past little while.

His face is way too recognizable for him to stroll into the bars, so he has his makeup artist create a silicone mask. Seems like Tom took his Mission: Impossible role to heart. It’s just what Ethan Hunt would do in the movies.”  It’s also been claimed that the disguise, which includes makeup, takes a full five hours to apply. If this rumor all sounds a little far-fetched, that’s because it is completely untrue, according to Gossip Cop. Tom Cruise does not go through some elaborate process to secretly step out on dates. In fact, there has not been any confirmation that Tom Cruise has dated anyone since Katie Holmes.  Alberto E.

Born Kate Garry Hudson on April 19, 1979, in Los Angeles, California, US, she came to prominence in 2001 with her incredible turn in Almost Famous. This role not only made her famous, but it also fetched her a Golden Globe and several nominations, including a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Being a daughter of American actress Goldie Hawn, Hudson bears more than a passing resemblance to her famous mother in both looks and onscreen vivacity. She got the chance to showcase her talent in 1996, when she made her TV debut on Fox's TV series Party of Five (1994-2000). Although she only appeared in one episode titled ""Spring Breaks: Part 1"", this initial experience was enough to uphold her determination to develop a professional acting career in Hollywood. However, it was in 1999 that she started to attract public attention when critics lauded her brilliant portrayal of Cindy in ""200 Cigarettes"", even though the movie itself was a commercial disappointment. Onwards, her career experienced a significant advancement, especially after she managed to obtain a supporting role in ""Gossip"" and ""Dr T and the Women"" which both came up in 2000. While her accolade-worthy performance in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous indicated that she was set to follow her mother in taking the film industry by storm. In the midst of a whirlwind schedule of fashion shoots and awards shows, she made an appearance in the romantic war drama The Four Feathers in 2002. Turning out to be a box-office failure, Hudson fired back with the surefire hit as she starred opposite quirky heartthrob Matthew McConaughey in the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003). She continued to establish herself as a fully-fledged actress starring in subsequent productions like Raising Helen (2004), The Skeleton Key (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), Fool's Gold (2008) and Bride Wars (2009).

gossipcop-7885025406,1,"More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor’s shocking dismissal.  “The whole thing has been very painful for me,” Couric, 61, tells PEOPLE. “The accounts I’ve read and heard have been disturbing, distressing and disorienting and it’s completely unacceptable that any woman at the Today show experienced this kind of treatment.  “I had no idea this was going on during my tenure or after I left,” she continued. “I think I speak for many of my former colleagues when I say this was not the Matt we knew. Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It’s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.”  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer “pinches me on the ass a lot.” A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer’s firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC’s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry.

The movement inspired the new Time’s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time’s Up was a major focus at this year’s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  “I think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,” Couric tells PEOPLE about Time’s Up. “Clearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.”  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  “One of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,” she says. “I just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this.

But the male player ranked 701 in the world - Dmitry Tursunov - believes he could beat her.  Speaking to US radio station NPR, seven-time Grand Slam champion McEnroe said of former world number one Williams, who has won an Open-era record 23 Grand Slams: ""If she played the men's circuit she'd be, like, 700 in the world.""  He qualified the comments by saying: ""That doesn't mean I don't think Serena is an incredible player, and I suppose anything's possible; maybe at some point a women's tennis player can be better than anybody.""  But he added: ""I just haven't seen that in any other sport, and I haven't seen it in tennis. If she had to just play the men's circuit, it would be an entirely different story.""  Williams later responded on Twitter: ""Dear John, I adore and respect you but please please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based.  ""I've never played anyone ranked ""there"" nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I'm trying to have a baby. Good day sir.""  Williams, 35, won her 23rd Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January. It later transpired she was pregnant at the time  'She is pregnant, and I'm not'  Tursunov, 34, was once ranked as high as 20th in the world.  The Russian told BBC World Service Sport he did not think McEnroe was ""trying to talk women's tennis down"" but said ""the reality"" was that ""men are stronger in general"".  ""I would hope that I would win against Serena,"" he added.  ""It would be a similar argument to: who would run faster, the fastest woman or the fastest man? Tennis is becoming more and more a physical sport, so it's going to be hard for a woman to beat the men.  ""It's not black and white, there are lots of factors to take into account. Physically I might not be in the best shape of my life but as an overall package I'm much better than my ranking would suggest. She is pregnant, and I'm not.  ""I've never heard John say anything absolutely stupid - he knows his stuff. What he said about her being an incredible player is correct - explosive, powerful and she puts in a lot of work. But I would hope that I would win.""  Battle of the sexes  A crowd of 30,000 watched Billie Jean King take on Bobby Riggs in Houston in 1973  Tennis matches between men and women have occurred before, mostly notably back in 1973 when Billie Jean King took on fellow American Bobby Riggs.  Riggs, the world number one in the 1940s, retired in 1951 and at the age of 55 believed he could beat any of the top female players.  King originally declined to play Riggs and Australian Margaret Court - at the time the top female player in the world - stepped in. Riggs won 6-2 6-1.  But later that year, the top ranked women's player King - 26 years younger than Riggs at 29 - took him on in an exhibition match at the Houston Astrodome and won 6-4 6-3 6-3.  A third 'Battle of the Sexes' match took in 1992 between American former world number one Jimmy Connors, aged 40 at the time, and Czech and American Martina Navratilova, who was 35.  The match took place under special rules to make it more competitive - Connors was allowed only one serve per point, and Navratilova was allowed to hit into half the doubles court. Connors won 7-5 6-2.","You are a journalist. Given a 'passage', please paraphrase it. Do not generate any other word.

""I would hope that I would win against Serena,"" he added.  ""It would be a similar argument to: who would run faster, the fastest woman or the fastest man? Tennis is becoming more and more a physical sport, so it's going to be hard for a woman to beat the men.  ""It's not black and white, there are lots of factors to take into account. Physically I might not be in the best shape of my life but as an overall package I'm much better than my ranking would suggest. She is pregnant, and I'm not.  ""I've never heard John say anything absolutely stupid - he knows his stuff. What he said about her being an incredible player is correct - explosive, powerful and she puts in a lot of work. But I would hope that I would win.""  Battle of the sexes  A crowd of 30,000 watched Billie Jean King take on Bobby Riggs in Houston in 1973  Tennis matches between men and women have occurred before, mostly notably back in 1973 when Billie Jean King took on fellow American Bobby Riggs.  Riggs, the world number one in the 1940s, retired in 1951 and at the age of 55 believed he could beat any of the top female players.  King originally declined to play Riggs and Australian Margaret Court - at the time the top female player in the world - stepped in. Riggs won 6-2 6-1.  But later that year, the top ranked women's player King - 26 years younger than Riggs at 29 - took him on in an exhibition match at the Houston Astrodome and won 6-4 6-3 6-3.  A third 'Battle of the Sexes' match took in 1992 between American former world number one Jimmy Connors, aged 40 at the time, and Czech and American Martina Navratilova, who was 35.  The match took place under special rules to make it more competitive - Connors was allowed only one serve per point, and Navratilova was allowed to hit into half the doubles court. Connors won 7-5 6-2.","It's difficult to directly compare those matches to a hypothetical Williams-Tursunov contest because of the differences in age, fitness and, in the case of the 1973 matches, the technology and conditions.  But the debate continues, with former world number one and 12-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic adding his voice to the discussion.  ""I think it's very hard to say that a woman can beat a man in tennis,"" the Serb told BBC World Service Sport.  ""It's not just about the physical strength and power, but also about the mental strength and the fighting spirit and the will to win.  ""If you look at the statistics and the results, men's tennis is still a lot more competitive and a lot more physically demanding than women's tennis.  ""I don't see anything wrong with saying that. It's just the reality of the situation. ""But of course, you can't discredit the incredible achievements that women's tennis players have had. They are also incredible athletes and incredible champions.""",paraphrase_generation

Celebrities took to social media Friday morning to share their thoughts on the inauguration, and in some cases, suggested alternative viewing. Trump, who has not been particularly popular among the celebrity circuit, inspired a #Brownout from George Lopez. The comedian began the movement on Twitter in protest of Trump not appointing a Latino to his cabinet, which every president has done since 1988. Lopez encouraged his followers to change their avatar to a brown square in support.

The country superstar opened up about his romance with the No Doubt frontwoman in a new interview with Billboard magazine.  As previously reported, Shelton told Stefani that he was splitting from Lambert during a meeting with their Voice coworkers. The “Misery” singer, who was new to the team at the time, got emotional.  “I won’t forget that day. I looked over at Gwen — who I didn’t really know — and she had these huge tears in her eyes. I thought, ‘Wow, she feels super bad for me!’” Shelton recalled. “She didn’t tell me much, because we didn’t know each other at the time, but she said, ‘I’m going through something very similar to what you’re going through. I understand. And I hate it.’”  Stefani was dealing with her own breakup at the time with Gavin Rossdale. (As Us Weekly exclusively revealed, the Bush rocker was cheating on her with their children’s nanny, Mindy Mann.) They announced they were ending their 13-year marriage in August 2015, one month after Shelton and Lambert announced they were divorcing after four years.  The “Came Here to Forget” singer and Stefani leaned on each other for support during the difficult time. The closer they got, the more Shelton saw Stefani in a new light.  “That’s kind of how our friendship and bond started, that day. It went from that, to checking in on each other once a week through email — ‘This s–t happened to me, what happened to you?’ — to maybe three times a week, then every day, to ‘Hey, here’s my phone number if you ever want to text,’” Shelton told Billboard. “Next thing I know, I wake up and she’s all I care about, and I’m ­wondering if she feels the same about me.”  “Gwen saved my life,” he added. “Who else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician? You can’t even imagine the similarities in our divorces.”  The two teamed up professionally too. Shelton included their collaborative track, “Go Ahead and Break My Heart,” on his 12th studio album, If I’m Honest.  “When we recorded the vocals for some of these songs, I was only six months removed from when all the crap went down,” Shelton said of his split from Lambert. “When you have a broken heart — at least, when I do — you got to get it out of your system. You want people to sympathize with you.

Wintour introduced sweeping changes to Vogue from her first issue forward. Many of these changes could be seen right on the cover. Wintour favored more naturalistic photography of lesser-known models outside, as opposed to the tight headshots the magazine had previously favored. Additionally, Wintour's first Vogue cover was also the first to feature a model wearing jeans, with the added bonus of wearing a bejeweled T-shirt valued at around $10,000.

It’s been more than two years since Blake Shelton, 40, and Miranda Lambert, 33, ended their marriage, but she’s finally ready to sit down and hash things out, according to a new report. Amidst new rumors that Blake is having trouble in his relationship with Gwen Stefani, 47, an insider tells InTouch that Miranda wants to confront her ex to finally get closure. “It needs to be done,” the source tells the mag. “There’s still a lot of unfinished business between [Miranda] and Blake. She needs to look straight into Blake’s eyes, ask certain questions, and get answers.”  There are no plans set for this meeting to actually take place just yet, but the mag claims that if it does happen, Miranda plans to go in with a “clear head,” although that might not be so easy. “This could get heated,” the insider admits. “As soon as the emotions come up, [Miranda] may lose it.” This doesn’t mean the 33-year-old wants to get back together with her ex, though — actually, it’s just the opposite. She’s very happy with her man, Anderson East, 29, but feels a face-to-face with Blake is what she needs to fully be ready to commit to another relationship, according to the source.  “She feels that [she and Blake] have both grown so much since their divorce that meeting up is essential for them to have healthy relationships in the future,” InTouch’s insider says. “Who knows, maybe this meeting with Blake will have them walk away as friends. Either way, they’ll definitely be in a better place.”  As for the rumored trouble between Blake and Gwen, we’re going to take that report (from OK! magazine) with a grain of salt. After all, they were just spotted looking totally in love on Aug. 20!

gossipcop-4524134287,1,"No need to rush. Jennifer Lopez is not in a hurry to walk down the aisle with Alex Rodriguez, but she does want to spend the rest of her life with someone.  “I do believe in marriage,” the Shades of Blue actress, 48, told Harper’s Bazaar in a story published on Thursday, March 15. “And I would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship. But I’m not forcing anything right now.”  As far as her relationship with the 42-year-old former Yankees player, she said: “It’s good, it’s healthy; we communicate well. We understand each other’s lives in a way that most other people couldn’t.”  She added: “We both entered the public eye in our early twenties and overachieved right from the start. And that affects every dynamic in your life, from your family to your work to your relationships. We have a similar makeup.”  The pair celebrated their anniversary in February in Minneapolis, where the singer performed a concert ahead of the Super Bowl. During the show, she debuted her single “Us” written by Poo Bear and produced by Skrillex, and dedicated it to Rodriguez, who was in the audience. “We’ve been together for one year today. I don’t want to get all mushy or anything, but baby, this song’s for you. I love you,” she told the athlete while on stage.  When talking about how she chose the song, Lopez told the magazine that the lyrics fit right into where the couple were in their relationship. She said: “They played me about 20 different songs, and when I heard this one I was like, ‘Oh, this is relevant!’ Alex and I were just getting to know each other. And I was like, ‘Oh, my God, could this be? Could this be us?’”  Lopez was previously married to chef Ojani Noa for nearly a year in 1997, and dancer Cris Judd from 2001 to 2002. She later married singer Marc Anthony in 2004 and they called it quits in 2011. The pair share 10-year-old twins Max and Emme.

I also know my strengths and weaknesses. It took me a long time to get to a point where I could say something nice about myself. I’m glad I can do that now.”  Lopez remains optimistic as she continues with her career, raise her two children and make her relationship with Rodriguez work for the long run. “Baseball is just like life,” she said. “All you want to do is hit a home run.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!","You are a journalist.

gossipcop-4774142356,1,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.

After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T",MZ reported in September 2017 that Holmes had indeed become a “free agent” after the five-year mark passed in August.,paraphrase_generation

She has received an Academy Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards, and has been cited as Hollywood's highest-paid actress. Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin' to Get Out (1982). Her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993), followed by her first leading role in a major film, Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999). Jolie's starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her successful action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014). In the 2010s, Jolie expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), By the Sea (2015), and First They Killed My Father (2017). In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity.

gossipcop-1551062653,1,"  George Clooney and his wife, Amal, attend the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. (Alberto Pizzoli/AFP via Getty Images)  Once the ultimate bachelor — and two-time People’s Sexiest Man Alive cover model — George Clooney entered entirely new territory this week.  The Oscar-winning actor and his human-rights-lawyer wife of two years, Amal, announced Tuesday that they are the proud new parents of twins, Ella and Alexander.  Clooney has donned many hats in his life — actor, director, producer and activist, but fatherhood had always seemed far away. Was it the early-onset-salt-and-pepper hair? The coterie of models who found themselves on his arm for fleeting moments over the years? The insistence by tabloids and fellow co-stars that it was time for him to settle down? Maybe. Or perhaps it was the simple fact that Clooney himself said again and again that he would not reproduce. In several interviews. Many, many times. For many, many years.  A first-time father at 56, Clooney was often asked throughout his career whether the single life was his ultimate future. But after proposing marriage to Amal in April 2014 and marrying her that September (as well as sharing wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain), it seemed as if anything was possible for the man who once said, “I don’t see myself ever having kids.”  But it was a long road to get there. “I don’t have that gene that people have to replicate,” he told People in 2006.  When Esquire asked him why he wasn’t married with kids, he replied, “I haven’t had aspirations in that way, ever.” And as for people who thought it was weird that a man in his 50s was single and childless? “What do you do? Should I go, ‘I got to get me some kids right now!’ and rush out and impregnate someone?”  Clooney seemed to express frustration when asked how he could ever relate to the fathers he occasionally portrays onscreen. His answer: “Well, I’m also not running for president, but I played that role in ‘Ides of March.’ I wasn’t an actual lawyer when I did ‘Michael Clayton,’ and I don’t fire people for a living like I did in ‘Up in the Air.’ ”  “I keep saying I’ll never get married again or have children but people just don’t want to believe me,” Clooney told Britain’s Daily Express just three months before popping the question to his now-wife.  Of course, celebrities are people, too, and it shouldn’t surprise anyone that a man might change his mind around the midcentury mark. And Clooney is certainly not alone in choosing to wait till later in life to welcome a child into the family: Comedian Steve Martin became a father at age 67 in 2012; Elton John was 63 when he had a baby via a surrogate in 2010; and Chris Noth was 53 when he welcomed his only child in 2008.  Perhaps it’s the fact that Clooney always seemed so delightfully and devilishly Clooney-ish that made his bachelordom seem like the only constant in our ever-changing popular culture. But we can rest easy knowing that despite some hesitation about having a family over the years, his sense of humor has remained steady throughout.  “Ella, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine,” the statement announcing the birth of the twins read. “George is sedated and should recover in a few days.”","You are a journalist.

George Clooney has been a well-known actor for decades, and during that time he has been asked repeatedly if he plans to get married and have children. He has always said no, he doesn't have the gene to replicate, and he hasn't had aspirations in that way.  But then he met Amal, a human-rights lawyer, and everything changed. They got married in 2014, and now they have twins, a boy named Alexander and a girl named Ella. Clooney is 56, and it's a big change for him, but he's taking it in stride. He's still the same charming, witty guy he's always been, and he's even making jokes about being a new father.  It's not uncommon for people to change their minds about having children, and Clooney is no exception. He's not alone in waiting until later in life to have a family, and he's in good company with other celebrities like Steve Martin, Elton John, and Chris Noth, who all became fathers later in life.  Clooney's always been a bit of a bachelor, and it's hard to imagine him as a father, but he's taking to it well. He's still the same Clooney we know and love, and he's even making jokes about being a new father. It's nice to see him happy and settled, and we wish him and his family all the best.",paraphrase_generation

It’s set in the present day, but in spirit it’s a sophisticated retro ’70s drama built around the uncanny flow of feeling that develops between the movie’s two stars: Bradley Cooper, who plays Jackson Maine, a hard-drinking, bad-ol’-boy redneck rock ‘n’ roller who is still hanging on as a popular attraction but has lost the lust for what he’s doing, and Lady Gaga, in her fetching and accomplished movie-star debut, as Ally, an ingenuous, fresh-faced singer-songwriter who becomes his lover and stage partner before rocketing on her own into the new pop stratosphere. She takes off as he slowly crashes — that’s the soapy tragic “Star Is Born” concept. But what the movie does is to take this fabled melodramatic romantic seesaw and turn it into something indelibly heartfelt and revealing. Cooper directed the movie himself, working from a script he co-wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, and to say that he does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment. As a filmmaker, Bradley Cooper gets right onto the high wire, staging scenes that take their time and play out with a shaggy intimacy that’s shorn of the usual “beats.” The new “Star Is Born” is a total emotional knockout, but it’s also a movie that gets you to believe, at every step, in the complicated rapture of the story it’s telling. More Reviews Venice Film review: 'Isis, Tomorrow. The Lost Souls of Mosul' Telluride Film Review: 'They'll Love Me When I'm Dead' The 1976 version, starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, had some terrific cornball love songs, but they didn’t belong anywhere near the stadium-rock stage, and neither did Streisand, which is part of why the movie came off as borderline ludicrous. It seemed stranded, with a kind of campy sincere ineptitude, between three worlds: Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand rock-princess fantasy. But from the electrifying opening moments of the new version, in which Jackson, boozy and raw, with his sunburned squint and hard-bitten shit-kicker sexiness, takes the stage of a gigantic stadium and launches into a grinding slow rocker that sounds like “Victim of Love”-era Eagles as done by the Allman Brothers, the movie is thrillingly authentic. That’s no minor accomplishment. Hollywood almost never succeeds in nailing the rock world, but “A Star Is Born,” though a love story through and through, is the most lived-in rock ‘n’ roll movie since “Almost Famous.” And that absolute looks right, sounds right, feels right verisimilitude sets the stage for everything that follows. Jackson, who looks to be in his mid-40s, has been around long enough that he now occupies a grey zone between legend and nostalgia. He can still fill an arena full of screaming fans, and his old hits have become classic-rock chestnuts, but his sound and persona have long slipped out of the zeitgeist. His whole outlaw look — the beard and rancher’s hat, the Kristofferson-meets-Skynyrd soused macho twinkle — mark him as a charismatic relic, and the grand irony is this: What that look, and sound, are all about is an era when rock ‘n’ roll strutted its “authenticity,” but now that he’s out of date, Jackson’s authenticity looks more than ever like a showbiz conceit, frozen in amber. It’s a part he’s playing, an image he’s working — and secretly struggling — to keep alive. He’s got a signature ballad that goes “Maybe it’s time to let the old ways die,” and when he wrote it (long ago), he probably didn’t know that he was talking about himself. In the first of many telling jump cuts, the film leaps from his on-stage glory to Jackson slinking into the back of his car, weary and alone, grabbing the bottle of gin he’s got stashed there. He takes a guzzle, and Cooper, acting with his body, lets you feel just how much Jackson (between sickly coughs) needs the lifeblood of that drink. It’s what he believes in more than the show he’s just finished. How do you play a drunk? We know, of course, that the answer is not to “play drunk,” but Cooper doesn’t just avoid the usual slurry shambling (though at key moments he does a little of that too, and it’s powerful). He brings off something I’ve rarely seen done this exquisitely: He plays blitzed, very functional and in his element, his smile and reflexes greased by the liquor. Jackson speaks in a deep, low, deliberate Southern-stud growl — a voice with real music in it, though one that lets you taste all the booze it’s marinated in. Needing another drink, he has his driver drop him off at the first available bar, which turns out to be a roadside dive on drag-queen karaoke night. It’s not his scene, but he doesn’t mind.

The two of them start singing together, and though he’s the star, it’s her voice that soars. “A Star Is Born” is a movie that’s high on the thrill of music, and on the thrill of two people connecting through music. It’s a movie that, in its own shaggy, intuitive way, gets at the essence of what it means to be a performer, and what it means to fall in love with someone who speaks your language. It’s a movie that takes its time, that luxuriates in moments of stillness and silence, and that knows that the most powerful emotions are the ones that don’t need to be shouted from the rooftops. It’s a movie that, in its own sneaky way, gets you to believe in the magic of love and music and the movies.

Lisa Kudrow has offered up even more proof that the cast of “Friends” took the name of the beloved sitcom to heart.  On Monday, the actress told People that her co-stars altered a pre-show ritual when she was pregnant during Seasons 4 and 5 to include her unborn child — her now 20-year-old son, Julian Murray Stern.  “The six of us would do a huddle backstage and just say, ‘All right, have a good show, love you love you love you love you,’” Kudrow, 55, told the outlet. “And when I was pregnant, then they would say, ‘Have a great show, love you love you — love you, little Julian!’ ’Cause we knew it was a boy and that was his name.”  She added: “So sweet, they included my little fetus in the huddle.”  The stars of “Friends” embraced one another’s children at other times, too.

In 2005, Jennifer Aniston was named godmother of Courteney Cox’s daughter, Coco Arquette.","In a 2019 interview with InStyle, Cox, 56, recalled how her co-stars supported her through her pregnancy and the early days of motherhood.  “I remember when I was pregnant with Coco and we were shooting the show, the girls would all come to my trailer and we’d do prenatal yoga together,” she said.  “It was just a really beautiful time in our lives, and we were all so supportive of each other.”  The tight bond shared by the cast of “Friends” is well-documented. The group, which includes Aniston, Cox, Kudrow, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, has remained close over the years, often reuniting for various projects and events.  They have also shown their love and support for each other in various ways, from attending each other’s weddings to publicly backing one another in times of need.   In 2019, Aniston, 51, opened up to Ellen DeGeneres about the cast’s enduring friendship, saying, “We’ve all been through a lot together. We’ve known each other for a long time, and we’ve grown up together. We’ve had our ups and downs, our highs and lows.

gossipcop-1716370499,1,"Dakota Johnson; most of us know her as the actress from Fifty Shades of Grey. While we may have seen Johnson in some pretty intimate positions on-screen, there’s definitely a lot we don’t know about the Fifty Shades star. Like, for instance, the superfluity of familiar names in her family tree. Seeing that her popular movie, Fifty Shades Darker came out on the day of love—Valentine's Day—it's only fitting to dedicate a piece to the actress who brought us the sexy and quaint, Anastasia Steele. Johnson, after all, has become somewhat something of a Valentine’s Day staple, herself. Here are 15 facts about Dakota Johnson or, as some might call her, ""that girl from Fifty Shades of Grey."" We guarantee that she will no longer by ""that girl"" by the end of the list! 15 Her Family Tree Is Full Of Famous Faces You know how we said there are a few familiar names in her family tree? Well, we weren’t lying. Her parents are fellow actors, Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. Unfortunately, her parents divorced in 1994 so Dakota had to split her time between the two. ""It was the only way that I could be with them,"" she said in an interview for Cosmopolitan. ""And since they were divorced, I would spend two weeks with one and two weeks with the other, traveling with a tutor."" But wait, it gets better. Her maternal grandmother (can you guess..) is Hitchcock actress Tippi Hedren. Yes, that’s right, so clearly creative talent lies in that family. We’ve never heard of a family tree with so many famous names! Thanksgiving is probably a whirlwind. Now, Dakota Johnson is another famous name in that tree. 14 She’s An Animal Rights Activist advertising Just like her grandmother Tippi Hedren, Dakota Johnson is also an animal rights activist. Like grandmother, like granddaughter shall we say? As animal lovers ourselves, we’re pleased to hear that she’s following in her grandmother’s footsteps—both in acting and in animal rights. In 2014, Johnson saved 12 horses from being slaughtered by paying for them. What a sweet thing to do! We bet her grandmother was really proud. It’s always so great to hear about celebrities doing positive things - so naturally, we’re happy to hear of Dakota’s compassionate side. We admit we have a soft spot for animal lovers, but who doesn't? We always love hearing about people doing good deeds for animals and it’s always nice to hear celebrities using their celebrity title for the better. 13 She Grew Up Shooting Guns And Riding Horses In Colorado She may play the innocent and naive Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades movies, but growing up Johnson was anything but naive. She grew up in Colorado at her dad’s house, where she learned to build a fire, ride a horse, ride motorbikes, and even shoot a gun. And this was all before she was just 10 years old! Sounds like a badass kid to us! But when she wasn’t at her father’s house, she was at her mom’s house in L.A. which she also loved. It's hard to imagine a 10 year old these days shooting guns, riding motorbikes, or building fires without being grounded. But it sounds like she had a pretty inspiring and freeing childhood which makes us fall for the actress all the more. 12 She Never Dates advertising By the header, we mean she never has casual relationships. She only has long-term relationships. Good for her, is all we can say! You hear of so many celebrities who are constantly dating other celebrities. You can barely keep up with who they’re dating these days. It seems to be one guy or girl after another. So it’s great to hear of Dakota’s conservative views on relationships. Apparently she’s only ever been in long-term, serious relationships; she doesn’t just date. That probably explains why she’s been in a relationship with model Matthew Hitt since 2014. Yes, it’s been a kind of an on-and-off relationship but they’ve been in it for the long haul so far. So, to sum up, we like her whole dating attitude. The commitment is great and saves you a lot of time. 11 She HATED School It seems like we have something in common with Dakota Johnson: a loathing of school. Okay, so maybe not all of you hated school - many of you probably loved school or at least thrived at school. But most of us can say with the utmost certainty that we hated school with a passion. We all have our reasons why. Johnson, for instance, hated school because she felt like an ""alien."" She said she didn’t understand the process of school as a child and felt ""suffocated."" I don't know about you guys, but I can totally relate with Dakota on this. Many of us felt like we didn’t really fit in at school so it’s especially comforting to hear that a big name like Dakota Johnson also felt like a social outcast in class. Like many of us, she preferred hanging out with her friends than going to school. But hey, we admire her honesty. 10 Auditioning Gives Her Panic Attacks advertising Watching the pristine-looking A-list celebrities gliding around the Golden Globes Award ceremony is enough to wreck your mind with self-doubt over their unbelievably high levels of confidence and self esteem. If only we could possess as much poise! The truth is, many of these celebrities don’t feel that way at all; confident and self assured, that is. Dakota Johnson, for example, gets so nervous during auditions that she often has panic attacks. And we’re not just talking a bit of breathlessness here and there, we’re talking full-on panic attacks—the real deal. So before you come to your conclusions that the celebrities you see on television and in magazines are way more confident than you’ll ever be, just remember something: every single one of them suffers from self-doubt at one point or another.

So before you come to your conclusions that the celebrities you see on television and in magazines are way more confident than you’ll ever be, just remember something: every single one of them suffers from self-doubt at one point or another. It happens to all of","us. It's an unavoidable feeling. 9 She Has 3 Tattoos While we don’t know what they look like, we do know that Johnson has three tattoos. She’s got a tattoo of three birds on her right shoulder, a tat of a snake on her left ankle, and finally, she has a tattoo of the words ""I am enough"" on her left wrist. Her tattoos are small and meaningful, which we love. She says she wants to get more tattoos but doesn’t want them to be too big. We can totally respect that. When it comes to tattoos, you’ve got to be careful. You don’t want to end up with something permanently inked on your body that you’ll end up hating in the future. So, bravo to Dakota for being cautious with her tattoos. 8 She's Got A Thing For Older Guys She may be young herself but Dakota Johnson definitely has a thing for older guys. She’s even been spotted with some silver foxes at events. It seems like she has a thing for men with experience and maturity. We can’t say we blame her. There’s just something so attractive about an older man with a little bit of gray hair, isn’t there? Just us? Okay, maybe not. Anyway, we’re glad to see Johnson isn’t afraid to own her thing for older men. She’s not afraid to admit it and we admire that. 7 She's Been In Show Business Since She Was 12 advertising While most of us were still figuring out our lives when we were 12 years old, Dakota Johnson was already starting her career in show business. She was a model at 12 years old and was even featured in a Teen Vogue spread. She started her acting career at the age of 17. She had small roles in movies and TV shows until she landed the role of Anastasia Steele in Fifty Shades of Grey. That’s definitely a lot of experience for someone so young. She's been in the business for a long time, and we can only imagine that she's seen and experienced a lot in her time. We wonder what she's learned from it all! 6 She Was Once Engaged To Jordan Masterson advertising Before she met her current beau, Matthew Hitt, Dakota Johnson was engaged to Jordan Masterson. They were engaged for about two years before they broke up. Masterson is an actor, best known for his role in the hit show Last Man Standing. The two started dating in 2011 and got engaged in 2012. They were even living together at one point. Unfortunately, things just didn’t work out and they ended up breaking up in 2014. We’re not sure what went wrong, but sometimes things just don’t work out. 5 She Was The First Person To Play Anastasia Steele On Screen advertising When it was announced that Fifty Shades of Grey was going to be made into a movie, everyone was curious about who would play the iconic role of Anastasia Steele. It was a big role to fill and many people auditioned for it. But in the end, it was Dakota Johnson who won the role. She was the first person to bring Anastasia Steele to life on screen. And let's be real, she did a great job. She embodied the character perfectly and really brought her to life. We can’t imagine anyone else in the role now. 4 She's A Proud Feminist advertising Dakota Johnson is not afraid to speak her mind and she’s definitely not afraid to talk about feminism. She’s a proud feminist and she’s not afraid to let the world know it. She’s even been known to use her platform to speak out against sexism and gender inequality. She told Elle UK, ""I think about how I can use my platform to say something meaningful. Women’s rights are important and it’s important to me that I use my platform to do some good."" We love seeing celebrities using their platforms to spread positive messages. 3 She's Got A Thing For British Guys advertising It seems like Dakota Johnson has a thing for British guys. She’s been linked to a few of them, including her current boyfriend, Matthew Hitt. She’s also been linked to Benedict Cumberbatch and Jamie Dornan, who played Christian Grey in Fifty Shades of Grey. We wonder what it is about British guys that she likes. Is it the accent? The sense of humor? Who knows? But hey, we’re not complaining. We love seeing her with British guys. 2 She's Not A Fan of Watching Herself On Screen advertising Watching yourself on screen can be a pretty cringeworthy experience, especially if you’re not used to it. And for Dakota Johnson, it’s no different. She’s said that she doesn’t like watching herself on screen and that it makes her ""anxious."" She told The Guardian, ""I don’t like watching myself. It’s like, ‘Oh, that’s me. That’s my face. That’s my body. That’s my voice. Ugh.'"" We can definitely understand why she feels that way. It’s one thing to see yourself in a mirror or in a photo, but it’s a completely different thing to see yourself on a big screen. 1 She's Got A Sense Of Humor advertising Dakota Johnson may be known for her serious role in Fifty Shades of Grey, but she’s definitely got a funny side. She’s been known to make fun of herself and her profession. She’s even joked about how she’s ""a professional sex-haver"" and how she ""just pretends to be good at sex"" on screen. She seems like the kind of person who doesn’t take herself too seriously and we love that. She’s not afraid to poke fun at herself and we think that’s awesome.",paraphrase_generation

Her acting in ""The Town"" and ""The Age of Adaline"" was unconvincing, despite her physical appearance.

There's no significant difference between what Hudson and Lively can offer, but the market demands variety.

When she does, however, croaking noises come out of her mouth and the chandelier comes crashing down.

gossipcop-178000221,1,"Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn’t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family’s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million — as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.  What is the ‘Kate effect’?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world.

That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn’t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family’s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million — as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.  What is the ‘Kate effect’?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world. While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as “the Kate Effect,” ","sending sales of dresses and coats soaring. The Kate Effect is estimated to be worth millions to the British economy.  Kate Middleton is also a philanthropist and has supported many charities. She is the patron of several organizations including the National Portrait Gallery, the Natural History Museum, and Action on Addiction.  But when it comes to her own money, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, doesn’t have much to worry about. She is married into a royal family with a net worth of billions and her own net worth is estimated to be at least £5 million, or $7 million.",paraphrase_generation

That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.

Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T","ellingly, the two have not been seen together publicly since that beach stroll.  So, while Holmes’ publicist confirmed the relationship by denying the RadarOnline report, Foxx has not publicly acknowledged the relationship, and it is unclear whether he and Holmes remain a couple.

Please paraphrase the given passage.

The passage discusses Katie Holmes' relationships with her ex-husband Tom Cruise, her daughter Suri, and her current boyfriend Jamie Foxx. According to a report by RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were planning a $300,000 wedding, but it was called off when Foxx refused to sign a prenup with a no-cheating clause. A source told RadarOnline that Holmes noticed a lack of respect in Foxx's behavior and realized it wasn't healthy for her or Suri. The passage also mentions that Tom Cruise is trying to reconnect with his daughter Suri, whom he hasn't seen in over five years due to his involvement with the Church of Scientology. Holmes is hesitant about a reunion, but a source told Star magazine that she is slowly warming up to the idea. Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.",paraphrase_generation
