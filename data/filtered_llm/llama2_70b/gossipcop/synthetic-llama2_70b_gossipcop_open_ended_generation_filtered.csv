gossipcop-2266317886,1,"Mark March 21, 2016 on your calendar. Dancing With the Stars will return for its 22nd season with Len Goodman back where he belongs, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champ, and a baby boy or girl for Allison Holker. There's much to look forward to, but not before we close out this season one last time with everything that happened after the finale! (In case you missed it, you can read our recap of the best and worst moments here .) Almost an hour after Tom Bergeron declared Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough the winners of season 21, Bindi was still in disbelief, shouting from the top of her lungs, ""I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!"" Her exuberance and genuine nature endeared her to literally every one on set, but no one more so than Derek. ""It's just so special with Bindi,"" he told reporters backstage. ""She's a champion of life."" Bindi shared the same sentiment, telling those in the ballroom that she gained another brother in Derek. In case you needed further proof that the two are friends for life, consider this: Derek's hopping on a plane to Australia in a couple weeks ""to tackle crocodiles and get my official khakis!"" The Houghster may have nabbed his sixth Mirrorball trophy, but it was his partnership with Bindi that undoubtedly made it his favorite season. ""There's not a thing I would change about this season,"" he told Glamour post-show. ""There's not a week I would change, a dance I would change, and that was a very calming, very peaceful feeling. The show is a completely different show than the first time I won, and to win at this level and the standard that this show has been raised to, it's been incredible."" While Bindi and Derek make the press rounds in New York City, it's no secret that she's itching to get back to her hometown down under. ""I can't wait to get back to all the animals, continue all the conservation work, and carry on in my dad's footsteps."" Season 21 runner-ups Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter were understandably disappointed not to win the big prize, but they both praised Bindi and Derek for their phenomenal journey this season. ""Bindi was the whole package,"" praised the red-haired stunner. ""She and Derek had a beautiful partnership."" Still, ""it's bittersweet in may ways. Did I really want this to be my first Mirrorball? Absolutely. I would be lying if I said I didn't. But Bindi was undeniable this entire season. She grew so much, and she's just such a beautiful person you can't help but be captivated by her. Both [she and Nick] are winners, and I truly believe that."" Echoed Nick: ""It was just such a pleasure to be here. I didn't expect to get anything, so anytime something great happened in the competition, it was a pleasant surprise to me."" So what's up next for Nick? Well, aside from getting ready for Baby Boy Carter , his solo album ( All American ) drops today, and he has a movie coming out next year that he wrote and directed. As for third-place contestant, Alek Skarlatos , he'll be heading on the DWTS Tour this winter, but his immediate plans are much simpler: ""I can't wait to get on the plane tonight to eat. A lot."" But what about his dating life? Any updates on that? ""It's been pretty crazy, honestly. [I haven't had time] for many dates lately."" Added Lindsay: ""I'll be his wing woman on tour!"" During all the hectic action backstage, Allison Holker was a ball of energy, especially for someone six month's pregnant. ""I feel incredible!"" gushed the pro. ""Dancing around with a baby that's the size of a football in your belly is never an easy task, but it's been amazing. Although I never expected to see myself in a sparkly costume on the Dancing With the Stars stage six months pregnant!"" Allison (and husband tWitch) will find out the baby's gender on December 10, ""which is our anniversary too."" In case you're wondering, she'll reveal whether it's a boy or a girl on social media shortly thereafter! In the meantime, Allison's prepping for her first Thanksgiving in charge of the turkey as long as the nerves don't get the best of her. ""I heard you have to brine it, but I don't even know what that means!"" she laughed. ""I'm watching The Chew to learn techniques!"" One of the biggest stories backstage was the announcement that Len Goodman would be returning to the judges' table next season, and the news was heralded with much excitement from the pros. ""I can't wait,"" admitted Mark Ballas . ""I love Len. We missed him this season. It was definitely different, [so it will be] good to have him back in the driver's seat."" Allison Holker felt the same way: ""I think Len Goodman was the heart and soul of Dancing With the Stars and was such a great leader at the judges' table, along with Bruno, Carrie Ann, and Julianne."" Casting is currently underway for season 22. If Mark Ballas gets his wish, he'd love to have girlfriend BC Jean compete as a contestant. ""She would be great, but you know [the producers] would probably mess with us and give her to Derek!"" Mark joked. So what was B.C.'s take on this idea? ""Yeah, and we'd probably win,"" she laughed of the possibility of being paired with Mark's best friend and honorary brother. Speaking of Derek, Mark told us backstage that getting to perform with BC (who he called ""the love of my life"") while Derek and Bindi danced was his favorite part of the evening. ""It was just amazing, cool, and unique. I've been on this show nearly 10 years in a row, and I've never experienced something like that. To be able to perform with the love of my life and in front of my brother for life and the beautiful Bindi","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news.

gossipcop-2761931201,1,"Lou Rocco/Getty Images  How Michael Strahan’s net worth was built  Michael Strahan has grown his wealth through 14 years of playing pro football and his second career as a talk-show host.  The son of an Army major, Strahan grew up in Germany and did not play competitive high school football until his senior year when his parents sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in Texas.  The former defensive end played well enough to earn a scholarship to Texas Southern University. By his senior year of college, he had set a record for sacks, which got the attention of the NFL.  In 1993, the New York Giants drafted Strahan as the 40th overall draft pick. Over the next 14 seasons, he became the league’s all-time quarterback sack leader, played in the Pro Bowl and helped the Giants defeat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII.  Upon retiring in 2008, Strahan concentrated on his off-field talents. In 2012, he became Kelly Ripa’s “Live! With Kelly” co-host, replacing longtime host Regis Philbin. Four years later, he left the show and joined ABC’s “Good Morning America”; it took more than a year for “Live” to announce Ryan Seacrest as its new co-host.  Strahan also serves as a Fox NFL Sunday analyst during the football season.  As of May 2017, Strahan’s net worth was $65 million, with a salary of $17 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.  You can use this net worth calculator to see your net worth.  Michael Strahan  Born: 1971  Birthplace: Houston  What he’s up to now  Strahan hung up his jersey in 2008, but he did not retire quietly. As of April 2016, he is a full-time co-host on ABC’s morning show “Good Morning America.”  Months later, the network hired him to host his own game show, “$100,000 Pyramid,” a reboot of an old classic. The fashionable football star also launched his own clothing line in 2015 in JC Penney stores.  Along with Curt Menefee, Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long and Jimmy Johnson, Strahan appears on “Fox NFL Sunday” each week during the NFL season.  Accolades  Throughout both his college and pro football careers, Strahan had a reputation for sacking quarterbacks, and in 2001, he set the record for most sacks in an NFL season. He also appeared in the Pro Bowl seven times.  In 2008, after his final season in the NFL, he helped lead the New York Giants to a Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots.  As a morning show host, Strahan has earned two Daytime Emmy Awards for “Outstanding Talk Show Host” for his work on “Live! With Kelly and Michael.”","You are a journalist.

gossipcop-7392274516,1,"They both looked so happy, and so relaxed. They were beaming as they said their vows, and luckily, no one came forward to provide any reason that they might not be married. (This is always an exciting moment in a ceremony.) It was an extraordinary mix of tradition and modernity, of centuries of history and up-to-the moment flourishes. Oprah was here, and so was Meghan’s mother, an African-American social worker who wore a conventional mother-of-the-bride outfit and also a nose stud. It somehow looked charming and just right. The entire royal family was here, along with a complement of English aristocrats and important personages. The music was stately and beautiful. The setting was awe-inspiring. There was a flotilla of clergymen, an extraordinary mélange including the archbishop of Canterbury and — in a striking inclusion in this most ancient of places — the head of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Curry. Chosen to give the address to the congregations, Bishop Curry, who is African-American, quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His voice rising and falling with emotion, he made a big, generous, impassioned case for love as the most important thing there is, in religion and in life. His address came after a reading by Lady Jane Fellowes, Harry’s aunt (her sister was Diana, Princess of Wales) that was both full of joy and a signal, it seemed, that the sadness in Harry’s life since his mother’s death had finally lifted. It was a passage from the Song of Solomon: “Arise my love, my fair one, and come away; for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The dress was a success: sculptural simplicity. Photo Our fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, is also watching, and she has a quick take for us on Meghan Markle’s dress. It was absolutely simple: pure and sculptural, in double bonded silk cady with a wide boatneck, long sleeves and sweeping train. It was Meghan Markle’s wedding dress. It was by Clare Waight Keller, a British woman and the first female designer of Givenchy. And it was everything people had hoped. This was not a Cinderella choice, not one that spoke of fantasy or old-fashioned fairy tales. Instead, it placed the woman proudly front and center and underscored Ms. Markle’s own independence. At the same time, it celebrated female strength, promoted a local designer and reached a hand across to Europe (where Ms. Waight Keller has a day job). The five-meter veil was of silk tulle, with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads and organza, and contained embroidery representing the flora of all 53 Commonwealth nations. Video And it was entirely a surprise. In all the rumors that had swirled around The Dress, from Ralph & Russo to Stella McCartney, Ms. Waight Keller’s name had never come up. In the end, Ms. Markle outthought us all. As this starts, long may it continue. And the After-Party Dress The newly minted Duke and Duchess of Sussex departed Windsor for their evening reception at Frogmore House in a very James Bond fashion. The duchess wore a second dress by designer Stella McCartney. You can read our fashion critic Vanessa Friedman’s reaction here. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A good time was had by all (even before the cocktails). Photo Unlike a lot of weddings — and certainly unlike Kate and William’s wedding, just seven years ago — the guests inside hung out in the aisles, air-kissing and gossiping. It’s a great royal-and-celebrity cocktail party! (Sadly without cocktails.) Kate and William’s wedding was solemn, stately, stuffy, full of dignitaries, politicians, and the sort of boring personages known here as the great and the good. But this looked totally fun for the guests — even more fun than, say, the Academy Awards — because no one was competing for anything and no one was forced to talk about their outfits to television reporters. Part of the change in tone is down to the passage of time and to how much Britain, or perhaps the royal family, has changed in the last few years. Another reason, of course, is that Harry, being the second son and not a future king, has the freedom to be more relaxed, less constrained by tradition, and less conventional than his brother. This wedding has nothing to do with dynasty, or ensuring the security of the royal line. (We hope they have kids! But only because it’s fun to have kids, not because it would be some sort of international crisis if they did not.) This wedding had everything to do with two people who are totally into each other and wanted to have a great big happy celebration. Oprah, Beckhams and Clooneys, oh my! Photo One of the great excitements about any wedding, of course, is the moment you learn who has been invited and who has not. Meghan and Harry’s list was kept secret, until the very moment that dozens of mysterious figures started to enter St. George’s Chapel. It was very exciting. There was none other than Oprah Winfrey, in a snug pink dress, a pair of very cool sunglasses and a massive broad-brimmed hat spectacularly festooned with flowers. If anyone qualifies as American royalty, it is surely Oprah, with her ability to transcend race and background, and her great gift for openness and emotional candor. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Kate Middleton’s parents, Carole and Michael, were there. They have always done such a good job of wearing appropriate outfits, smiling tastefully and saying nothing. There was Charles Spencer, the Earl of Althorp, Diana’s brother, perhaps known best for his active love life and his impassioned attack on the British media after his sister’s death. It turned into Celebrity Central. George and Amal Clooney made their stately, Hollywood-y entrance (She was in yellow with an interesting train). David and Victoria Beckham, a.k.a. Posh and Becks, came in and graced some people in the crowd with their conversation.","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news.

Sarah went first, her voice trembling with emotion as she promised to love and cherish John for the rest of her life. John's response was equally heartfelt, his voice filled with happiness as he promised to support and care for Sarah through thick and thin.

As they exchanged rings, the crowd erupted into cheers and applause. It was clear that this was a moment that neither of them would ever forget. And, as they were pronounced husband and wife, they shared a kiss that left no doubt about the depth of their love for each other.

gossipcop-470066082,1,"Demi Lovato has sparked rumors of a new romance with Lauren Abedini, a Los Angeles-based DJ who goes by the stage name Kittens. According to Page Six, Lovato was spotted holding hands with Abedini in Disneyland over the weekend, causing fans and media outlets to speculate whether they could be dating. This is only the latest speculation surrounding Lovato’s love life, as the pop singer has never officially confirmed her sexuality– despite alluding to her being bisexual in her song lyrics.

The bad news is that it isn't me. — ste(screeching into the wilderness)ph (@stphfrndz) September 11, 2017 2. She’s Had Relationships With Several Male Celebrities Lovato, like most notable celebrities, have dated other people in the industry. According to Pop Sugar, she dated The Cab frontman Alex DeLeon from 2008-09, and later based the breakup song “Catch Me” on him. Lovato also had brief flings with Trace Cyrus (Miley’s older brother) in 2009 and Joe Jonas, her self-proclaimed “BFF,” in 2010. Her most notable relationship to date, however, has been with Valderrama, whom she dated from from 2010 to 2016. In an interview with Latina magazine, Lovato discussed what attracted her to the That 70’s Show actor: When I dated white guys, it wasn’t as passionate as my relationship with Wilmer. Maybe that’s just Wilmer. But I do believe that Latin people are just more expressive, more passionate with their emotions. He’s very manly, and he can be stubborn like Latino men can, but he’s protective and he cares so much and loves so hard. I’ve been blessed enough to have him in my life, and not just as my man, but also my best friend. Since her breakup from Valderrama, Lovato’s been seen with MMA fighter Guilherme “Bomba” Vasconcelos and Abedini. 3. Ruby Rose Claims that She & Lovato ‘Hooked Up’ in 2013 In 2013, model and actress Ruby Rose turned heads when she tweeted that she had a lesbian tryst with Lovato. “I’m like the one person demi has slept with that didn’t sell on naked photos of her so eff off,” Rose tweeted out. She went on to say “Think ill take a few days off social media whilst @ddlovato’s friends attack me for being a ‘scorned ex-lover’ get over it! I liked the hair.” Furthermore, a source for Life & Style said that Rose and Lovato dated for two years while the singer took a break from her relationship with Valderrama. A post shared by Ruby Rose (@rubyrose) on Aug 13, 2017 at 1:32pm PDT Lovato addressed these claims in a 2015 interview with Complex magazine. “Rumours are rumours, and people are going to spread them,” she said. “You can believe what you want, but no, I was not in a relationship with her. By the way, love is fluid.” The singer added “Whether there’s been rumours with one specific person or not, that’s all that matters. Humans are humans, and when you connect with somebody on a spiritual level it doesn’t matter. I don’t want people to ever look at the past or rumours or anything and try to figure me out.” 4. She Won the GLAAD Vanguard Award for Promoting LGBTQ Equality While Lovato may be keeping her personal life under wraps, she has made no effort to hide her support for the LGBTQ community. The singer has been so supportive, in fact, that she was given the GLAAD Vanguard Award in 2016, which, according to the GLAAD website, is “presented to media professionals who have made a significant difference in promoting equality and acceptance.” The award was given to her by close friend and former Camp Rock co-star Nick Jonas. “Demi Lovato has consistently used her platform as a successful artist to send messages of acceptance and support to LGBT people everywhere,” said GLAAD President & CEO Sarah Kate Ellis. “She is an extraordinary ally who is committed to helping young people embrace who they are and live the lives they love.” During her acceptance speech, Lovato said “You should always love yourself for who you are,” she said. “The skin that you are in, whether you identify with it and are afraid to tell people, just go for it. You can do it!” Watch the full speech above. 5. She Said She’s Not ‘Denying’ or ‘Confirming’ Her Sexuality Lovato’s 2015 single “Cool for the Summer” had many fans wondering whether or not this was her coy way of speaking on her sexuality.

gossipcop-5319163677,1,"Come December, it's become near tradition over the past few years for everyone to complain about how the previous 12 months have been the worst ever. This year, however really, really feels like it. This year has been a barrage of bizarre and bummer headlines that at times it's felt like some dystopian nightmare.  It's been so bad that the Kardashian-West clan have just decided to end 2016 early. Yes, Kim and Kanye have decided to cancel all public and professional commitments for the end of the year and plan to maintain their social media blackouts as well. To be exact, a flack told Page Six that Kim and Kanye “plan on taking the rest of 2016 off and spending time as a family.""  Which, frankly, we wish we all could do, don't we?  Is it possible for President Obama's last major act to be an executive decree for us to just all get a chance to chill out and recuperate for the remaining 26 days left in this bummer of a year? Sure, there's no political safeguarding against any potential additional music legends from dying or preventing any further tragedies and disasters from happening or ensuring that some new odd Zika-like disease pops up, but there's got to be something? How about the ""Netflix and Chill Act?"" Just an order that all Americans get to spend the next month relaxing and catching up on any television series they may have missed this year.  Of course, when it comes to Kim and Kanye it's understandable that they've decided to literally cancel the rest of their 2016. Kim was still in the midst of recuperating from being robbed at gunpoint in Paris when her husband Kanye was hospitalized following a very public breakdown.  They've had to endure these private tragedies while also dealing with immense public interest and rumors running rampant in the tabloid press.  E!, the home of the Kardashian's reality TV empire, reports that a family source says ""Kim is doing okay despite reports.""  ""She has many things on her plate so being overwhelmed is expected,"" the source continued. ""She wants to get Kanye back on his feet. She is not leaving him. She loves him.""  Kanye was released from an L.A.-area hospital last week after spending more than a week receiving treatment for exhaustion. Kim West was reportedly by his side throughout the entire ordeal and now wants to make sure Kanye continues to receive therapy and treatment now that he's out of the hospital.  Despite your personal opinion on the pair, it certainly does seem like the family deserves the rest. In addition to their dual ordeal, they also have two young children to care for after all (in fact, today is Saint West's first birthday). Maybe it's best we all let them lay low and chill for the next month or so.  Unfortunately, we all don't have the luxury as much as we wish we could. Then again, it's not looking like 2017 is shaping up to be any better. Hopefully, a rested and healthier Kim and Kanye can get back into form and provide us with the not-quite-as-tragic-as-this distractions we'll probably desperately need in the new year.  Update: Kanye, for one, has now reappeared in public, albeit in a very low-key way. He was spotted with newly blond hair at designer Rick Owens' furniture show in Los Angeles .","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news.

The 'sentence' is: ","Come December, it's become near tradition over the past few years for everyone to complain about how the previous 12 months have been the worst ever.","December is just around the corner, and with it comes the familiar refrain of people lamenting the past year as the worst ever. For the past few years, it has become a near tradition for individuals to express their dissatisfaction with the past 12 months, citing various reasons such as political turmoil, natural disasters, economic downturns, and personal struggles.

This year, however, seems to be different. A recent survey conducted by a leading research firm has revealed that the majority of people are actually optimistic about the future, despite the challenges faced in the past year. The survey found that over 70% of respondents believe that the coming year will be better than the previous one, with many expressing hope for improved economic conditions, political stability, and personal growth.

Experts attribute this shift in attitude to a growing sense of resilience and adaptability among people. According to a psychologist, ""People have learned to cope with uncertainty and adversity in new ways, and this has helped them to see the positive side of things even in difficult times.""

This newfound optimism is also reflected in people's plans for the coming year. Many are looking forward to starting new businesses, pursuing new hobbies, or taking on new challenges in their personal and professional lives.

While it is true that the past year has had its share of difficulties, it seems that people are determined to make the most of the future. As one respondent put it, ""Last year may have been tough, but I'm excited to see what the next year brings. I'm ready to take on whatever comes my way and make the best of it.""

In conclusion, it appears that people are breaking away from the tradition of complaining about the past year and are instead looking forward to the future with hope and optimism. This shift in attitude is a welcome change and bodes well for the coming year.",open_ended_generation

The groom, Prince Harry, is a member of the British royal family; the bride, Meghan Markle, is an American and former actress.[note 1] On the morning of the wedding, Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, conferred upon him the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel.

He and Meghan Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the Canadian-American legal-drama television series Suits, have been in a relationship since 2016, having first met in July 2016.[4] The relationship was officially acknowledged on 8 November 2016, when a statement was released from the royal family's communications secretary addressing the ""wave of abuse and harassment"" directed toward Markle.[5] Harry and Meghan attending church on Christmas Day, 2017 On 27 November 2017, Clarence House announced that Prince Harry would marry Markle in the spring of 2018.[6] They were engaged earlier the same month in London, with the Prince giving Markle a bespoke engagement ring made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, consisting of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection.[7] At the same time, it was announced that they would live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace following their marriage.[8] The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh expressed their delight at the news, while congratulations came in from various political leaders, including the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[8] During the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace's Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[9][10] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[7][11] Markle is the second American[note 2] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[12] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[13][14][15][16][17] Under the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign's consent in order to marry. Harry was fifth in line at the time of his engagement.[18] The Queen's consent was declared to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 14 March 2018.[19][20] Although Markle attended a private Catholic school in her early years, she is not Roman Catholic.[21] On 6 March 2018, she was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at St. James's Palace.[22] Although Markle was divorced, the Anglican Church has permitted marriage to divorced persons with a living spouse since 2002.[23][24] After the engagement, Markle began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[25] She will retain her U.S. citizenship during the process,[26] but Kensington Palace have indicated that the decision on whether she will retain dual nationality has not yet been made.[25] Retaining U.S. citizenship is expected to create tax complications.[27] The couple was invited to celebrate Christmas 2017 with the royal family at the Queen's Sandringham estate.[28] The official engagement photographs were taken by Alexi Lubomirski (a former assistant to Mario Testino) at Frogmore House, and were issued by Kensington Palace on 21 December 2017.[29] To mark the wedding of Harry and Meghan, the Royal Mint produced an official UK £5 coin, showing the couple in profile.[30] In May, a set of commemorative postage stamps, featuring the couple's official engagement photographs, was issued by Royal Mail.[31] Wedding [ edit ] Planning [ edit ] Preparation for wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Unlike the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the wedding day of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was not declared a bank holiday.[32] The wedding was on the same date as the FA Cup Final, which Prince Harry's brother William normally attends in his role as President of the Football Association.[33] Holding the royal wedding on a weekend is a break with the royal tradition of having weddings on a weekday.[34] On 12 February 2018, Kensington Palace announced that the ceremony would commence at 12:00 Midday BST. Venue [ edit ] The wedding took place on Saturday, 19 May 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor.[35] The chapel had previously been the venue for the weddings of Prince Harry's uncle, the Earl of Wessex, as well as that of his cousin, Peter Phillips, and for the blessing of the marriage of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, Harry's stepmother.[36] Cost [ edit ] The royal family announced that they would pay for the wedding.[37] The costs for the cake, the florist, and the catering have been estimated to be £50,000, £110,000, and £286,000 respectively,[38] and the overall cost is expected to be around £32 million.[39] The security costs are expected to be lower than those of the 2011 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.[40] The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead has reportedly spent £2.6 million on cleaning the town and roads.[40] It has been predicted that the wedding will trigger a tourism boom and boost the economy by up to £500 million.[41] Wedding attire [ edit ] The wedding invitations specified a dress code for men of ""Dress Uniform, Morning Coat","You are a journalist.

According to a new report, the Real Housewives of New Jersey star is planning to cash in on her husband Joe Giudice’s deportation proceedings.  If you recall, it was reported weeks ago that a judge had ruled that Joe should be deported upon his release from prison, where he is currently serving a 41-month-prison sentence for bank and wire fraud. Well now, sources are telling Radar Online that Bravo has offered Teresa $500,000 to film a special about his deportation.  “Teresa was offered big bucks to film a special about Joe’s deportation and she agreed to do it,” an insider revealed. “Half a million dollars to share the story on camera.”  And this story is believable because this isn’t Teresa’s first rodeo when it comes to cashing in on her crimes legal drama!  “It is going to be like the other specials when she was in prison and will show how she and Joe and the girls are handling the scary prospect of Joe getting deported,” added the source.  IS TERESA BEGGING PRESIDENT TRUMP TO STOP JOE’S DEPORTATION?  Earlier this year, an Immigration official confirmed that “records show that an immigration judge ordered Mr. Giudice be removed from the United States on March 14, 2018.”  A source close to Teresa adds that she needs the Bravo money as Joe tries to appeal the deportation order.  “Teresa will do anything for the money. She never stops thinking about taking care of her girls and she agreed to this so that they would have money for college. She is a good mom and wants to provide for her children,” the source stated.  Joe will reportedly be turned over to ICE custody upon his March 2019 release, although it is likely he could be released earlier than March which would mean an earlier deportation back to Italy.  UPDATE – Teresa is denying this report. Her attorney, James Leonard, tells the Gossip Cop website that she has no current plans to do a spinoff show about Joe’s possible deportation.

The show would reportedly feature the couple’s journey as they fight to stay together and keep their family intact, all while dealing with the legal and emotional challenges that come with Joe’s potential deportation.

Teresa has yet to confirm the reports, but insiders say that she is seriously considering the offer and is even in talks with several major networks. If the show does indeed come to fruition, it would mark the first time that Teresa has appeared on reality TV since her stint on Celebrity Apprentice back in 2015.

gossipcop-5210414258,1,"The things you plan the least sometimes turn out the best. This is why every right-thinking person hates St Valentine’s Day. Scheduling a day for romance is as joyful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon.  We’re in Stanley’s on St Andrew’s Street in Dublin, downstairs in the wine bar. It’s an unplanned outing after an impromptu cry of “Let’s go out, but not to our usual place”. I’ve eaten here before, and enjoyed it except for some oversalted fish. This is a second chance. They don’t come easily.  But two things happened after the previous review. First, a man who was at the next table wrote to me to say how much he loved Stanley’s. He had no vested interest, but was talking as a well-dined eater about town. Later, I found out that chef and co-owner Stephen McArdle had something more important on his hands than my dinner that night. His son had been born hours before.  If that doesn’t earn a second chance, nothing will. So we’re tucked in at a small table under the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted a soft green. There’s a candle in a wax-crusted wine bottle on the table and high-class jazz standards on the sound system.  For the moment, it feels like we’re not in Dublin. We could be in a city anywhere and lucky enough to find a place we’ll remember fondly when we get home.  The menu is chalked up on the wall and Liam has already ordered some cod croquettes, balls of soft fluffy fish in crispy lagging jackets sitting in a small puddle of silken house mayonnaise.  The star of Stanley’s is Morgan Vanderkamer. She’s the sommelier here. But don’t let that put you off. Bad sommeliers are pretentious up-sellers, there to push diners towards the wallet-busting bruisers on the wine list. Vanderkamer has taken the nonsense out of the role and will open your mind to new ideas about what to drink with your food. If you thought sherry was for fogeys and posers, she will change your mind. So we have ice-cold glasses of manzanilla to cut through the fluffy cod croquettes. We are in excellent hands.  The main event is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. We’re going with an oloroso, the ruby-coloured sherry that gets its colour and kick from time and ageing. There are two on the menu, Vanderkamer says. One is good; the other is “amazing”, and priced accordingly, she warns. With a €16 plate of food between us, we push the sherry cask out and live it large on the oloroso at €13 a glass. It is a good decision.  There’s a small farmyard on that €16 charcuterie plate: generous slices of duck ham, smoked cured slices of moist pink meat. The duck ham is the soulmate of the apricot puree dotted on one side of the plate. The sharp pickled gherkins sing with the “bacon and cabbage”, a slice of ham hock terrine wrapped in crinkly soft leaves of bright-green savoy cabbage. There are two small delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, delicate to the point of dissolving on contact with the tongue. The pear and vanilla sauce, in a small ramekin, takes the sweetness of the liver to another even more decadent place.  Just in case there isn’t enough on the plate (there is), we’ve ordered a plate of the bean and chorizo stew. The beans are in fact chick peas – but that’s even better in my book – and the chorizo has been minced to a small rubble that sits on top of the soupy mix. It’s the kind of stew where the juices have transformed from separate elements of meat, tomato, oil and wine into one glistening sheen. We get a blended Priorat, a Spanish red as heartwarming as the stew, to sip with it.  Dessert would be an option only for people less greedy in their savoury ordering. There’s a final glass of Rasteau, a fortified Grenache that’s served deliciously chilly. It’s a thought-provoking alternative to a syrupy dessert wine, and next time we’ll leave space for some cheese to go with it.  Romantic is a bleached-out word, but that’s what Stanley’s wine bar is: a properly love-it romantic joint, a new favourite to add to your list.  Dinner for two, with sherries a","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news. The writing style should be serious and convincing. Do not generate any other word. The 'sentence' is: ",The things you plan the least sometimes turn out the best. This is why every right-thinking person hates St Valentine’s Day.,"The things you plan the least sometimes turn out the best. This is why every right-thinking person hates St Valentine’s Day.

In a shocking turn of events, it has come to light that the much-maligned St Valentine’s Day has been the bane of many a right-thinking person’s existence. The holiday, which is traditionally celebrated on February 14th, has long been associated with grand gestures of love and romance. However, a recent survey has revealed that the things we plan the least often turn out the best, leading many to question the true meaning of this Hallmark holiday.

According to the survey, which was conducted by a leading research firm, a staggering 75% of respondents reported that their most memorable and joyful experiences occurred without advanced planning. In contrast, a paltry 12% claimed that their meticulously planned events turned out as well as they had hoped. These findings have led many to conclude that the pressure to plan the perfect Valentine’s Day celebration may be the source of much stress and disappointment.

“I always felt like I was doing something wrong on Valentine’s Day,” said one respondent. “Like, if I didn’t plan the perfect evening, my partner would think I didn’t care about them. It was a lot of pressure, and it took the fun out of the holiday.”

Others have echoed these sentiments, expressing frustration with the commercialization of the holiday and the emphasis on material gifts. “It’s not about the amount of money you spend or the number of roses you buy,” said another respondent. “It’s about showing your love and appreciation in a genuine way. And that doesn’t require a fancy dinner or a diamond necklace.”

In light of these findings, many are calling for a reevaluation of the way we approach Valentine’s Day. Rather than focusing on grand gestures and expensive gifts, they argue that we should embrace the spirit of spontaneity and authenticity. “Let’s take the pressure off and just enjoy the moment,” said one advocate. “After all, the things we plan the least sometimes turn out the best.”

As the world continues to grapple with the implications of this survey, one thing is clear: the way we think about Valentine’s Day is about to change forever.",open_ended_generation

The 46-year-old was spotted flaunting his chiseled abs to Emma Stone, 29, on Wednesday. According to eyewitnesses, the actor and the actress were enjoying a romantic dinner at a trendy restaurant in Los Angeles. They were seen laughing and chatting intimately, with Theroux at one point placing his hand on Stone's knee. The pair seemed to be completely absorbed in each other's company, oblivious to the attention they were attracting from other diners.

This sighting comes just a few weeks after Theroux's estranged wife, Jennifer Aniston, was seen moving out of their shared home. The former couple had been married for two and a half years before announcing their separation in February. Despite their split, Theroux has been open about his desire to remain friends with Aniston, with whom he shares a passion for fitness and healthy living.

Meanwhile, Stone has recently been linked to several high-profile celebrities, including her former co-star Bradley Cooper. However, it appears that she and Theroux have developed a strong connection, as they were seen exiting the restaurant together, arm in arm.

This latest sighting has sparked rumors of a possible romance between Theroux and Stone. While neither party has confirmed their relationship status, it is clear that they share a strong connection and enjoy each other's company.

Amidst rumors that the actress is marrying a British businessman, she’s put permanent roots down in California by purchasing the massive Cecil B. DeMille estate — check out pics of the lavish mansion here.  Angelina Jolie, 41, has a new home in Los Angeles…and it’s stunning. It’s been rumored for weeks that the 41-year-old had plans to purchase Cecil B. DeMille’s historic mansion, and now, she’s bit the bullet, putting down a $25 million offer, according to TMZ. The amount was reportedly accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow.  Cecil’s home, which he lived in until his death in 1959, is considered one of the greatest properties in L.A., and Angie will have some famous neighbors, including Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman and Ellen Pompeo. There’s tons of space for the six kids, too — the house boasts 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, plus a spacious backyard.  This huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53. The possibility of that big move happening seemed even more likely after reports surfaced on April 12 that Angie had met and fallen in love with a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.  The actress is reportedly already serious with this mystery man, and a family friend told InTouch that she’s even planning on marrying him! However, we also know that Brad and Angie’s divorce has been much more amicable recently, and she’s been letting him spend more and more time with the kids. Perhaps staying in Los Angeles is her way of making sure Pax, Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox continue to have a relationship with their father? Either way, the house is insane — check it out in the gallery above.  HollywoodLifers, what do you think of Angelina’s new house? Do you think she’s prepping for a wedding?","You are a journalist.

DeMille, has been meticulously restored to its former glory, showcasing intricate details and opulent finishes throughout.

According to sources close to the actress, Jolie fell in love with the estate's history and charm, and was willing to pay top dollar to make it her own. ""Angelina has always been drawn to unique and historic properties, and the DeMille estate fit the bill perfectly,"" said a source. ""She is thrilled to call this magnificent mansion her home.""

The purchase of the DeMille estate comes amidst rumors that Jolie is set to tie the knot with her British businessman beau.

gossipcop-8609335343,1,"Oh boy.  The first rule of going solo: Distance yourself as far as possible from the group and fan base that jump-started your career. Or so goes the advice Liam Payne is apparently following from Zayn: He’s the last to venture out on his own and the first to come out burning a bridge he still has to cross when it’s all said and done. On Liam’s first single, “Strip That Down,” he’s dissed One Direction plain as day. “You know I used to be in 1D, now I’m out free,” he sings. “People want me for one thing, that’s not me. I’m not changing the way that I used to be, I just want to have fun and get rowdy.”    But with nearly all remaining members of One Direction releasing new music of their own within weeks of each other, this song is not the only opportunity Payne has had to make his thoughts on his bandmates known. Speaking with Music Choice, he complimented Niall Horan’s new singles, but Harry Styles, not so much. “I’ll be honest with you, it’s not my sort of music. It’s not something I’d listen to,” he said. But he did have a quick save: “I think he did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. That’s the way I’d put it best, I think.” Liam also noted that Harry would probably say the same about his music since Harry doesn’t listen to hip-hop. “My song’s more ‘Rack City’ and his song is more of a different era to something I’d listen to, I guess,” he said. “Strip That Down” does feature a rapper, Migos’s Quavo, but a redux of the only song of note that Tyga has ever made it is not.","You are a journalist.

With so many talented musicians vying for attention, it can be tempting to try and ride the coattails of a successful group or fan base to get your start. But for one up-and-coming artist, the key to success has been to distance himself as far as possible from the group that jump-started his career.

Oh boy, a young rapper from the Midwest, has been making waves in the music industry with his unique sound and energetic live performances. But despite his early success, he knew that he needed to break free from the shadow of the group that had helped him get his start.

""I knew that if I wanted to really make it big, I needed to distance myself from the group and fan base that had helped me get my start,"" Oh boy said in a recent interview. ""It was a tough decision, but I knew it was the right one if I wanted to achieve my dreams.""

And distance himself he did. Oh boy packed up his bags and moved to the West Coast, where he began to build a new fan base and establish himself as a solo artist. It wasn't easy, of course - there were plenty of nights when he doubted himself and wondered if he had made the right decision. But with hard work and perseverance, he slowly began to make a name for himself as a solo artist.

Now, just a year later, Oh boy is making waves in the music industry with his debut solo album. The album, which features a mix of hip-hop and R&B, has been praised for its unique sound and catchy hooks. And with his energetic live performances, Oh boy is quickly becoming a fan favorite on the concert circuit.

Despite his success, Oh boy remains humble and grateful for the opportunity to pursue his dreams. ""I'm just grateful for the chance to do what I love every day,"" he said. ""I know that not everyone gets to live their dream, and I never want to take that for granted.""

gossipcop-4796409702,1,"Kim Kardashian is allegedly “phasing out” mom Kris Jenner, particularly when it comes to her responsibilities as her longtime manager, amid reports Kim is ready for a total image overhaul after returning to the spotlight following her October robbery.  That’s according to a new report by Radar Online, who’s claiming that the mother-daughter duo could be caught in a nasty feud as a source alleged that Kardashian has had somewhat of an epiphany during her time away from the spotlight and allegedly has now opened her eyes to see how Jenner “used her” to build the Kardashian brand.  According to the site, Kim is ready to project a very different image from the uber-glamorous money flaunting Kardashian fans used to know and is allegedly ready to kick mom Kris to the curb, at least professionally, in order to do so.  A source alleged to the site this week that Kim now “seems to be thinking that Kris used her to get where she is today,” which Radar Online is alleging could have led to a nasty feud between Jenner and her daughter as well as the reality star reportedly making a pretty big business decision when it comes to her mom.  “[Kim] will never think of [Kris] in the same way again,” the source said of Jenner’s supposed drama with her daughter amid reports she believes Jenner has been “using” her for years.  The site then went on to report that Kim is now in the process of projecting her new toned-down image amid the feud claims with Kris, revealing that Jenner may no longer play such a big part in Kardashian’s career going forward.  “Kim hired a transition team to make sure that she gives off a different image than she did previously,” the source said of Jenner and her daughter potentially parting ways professionally, claiming that “part of this process includes phasing out [Kris’s] management.”  While Kris and Kim have not commented on the claims, this isn’t the first time it’s been reported that Kardashian may be looking to distance herself from Jenner, at least professionally, in the wake of her October robbery in Paris.  Radar Online claimed back in October that Kim Kardashian had grown wise to Kris Jenner’s “money making machine” after taking some downtime at the end of 2016, alleging at the time that Kim has been so busy with her career that she’s failed to realize how much Jenner, who is often referred to as her “momager,” had been controlling her life and career.  “Kim never realized how much [Kris] and the money-making machine was controlling her until this robbery,” an insider told the site of Kardashian’s feelings about Jenner at the time, months before it was reported that the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is allegedly looking to “phase out” Kris from her career.  “Kim is just starting to think that maybe Kris’s intentions were not pure all along,” continued the source in October, adding that Kim has been doing a lot of thinking about her father Robert Kardashian while taking some time away which has allegedly helped her to get wise to Kris’s seemingly relentless pursuit of fame for herself and her family.  “[Kim] told her family that she wanted to be the girl that her father wanted her to be and not the girl that she became with Kris’s help,” a source revealed last year, just months before it was reported that a feud could be brewing between Kardashian and Jenner.

This move comes as no surprise, given Kim's desire for a complete image overhaul after her terrifying October robbery. 

According to an insider, Kim has been contemplating this decision for quite some time, as she believes that her mother's management style is no longer aligned with her vision for her career. ""Kim wants to take a more active role in her professional life and feels that Kris's methods are holding her back,"" the source revealed. 

Although Kris has been instrumental in Kim's success, the reality TV star is eager to explore new opportunities and branch out on her own. ""Kim wants to try new things and take risks, but Kris is too cautious and always tries to play it safe,"" the insider added. 

Kim's desire for change is understandable, given the traumatic experience she endured last year. The robbery, which took place in Paris, left her feeling vulnerable and shaken, and she has been slowly rebuilding her life and career ever since.

gossipcop-3967904178,1,"Watch Entertainment Tonight on Yahoo View.  Music’s odd couple, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton — aka the rocker and the country boy — have never been free of gossip speculating about their relationship. Apparently, the latest news is that the two are through. In Touch Weekly reports that Shelton actually unceremoniously dumped Stefani in February before embarking on a tour.  But wait — if that’s the case, then why is Stefani appearing with him on stage? And not just appearing … they’re appearing pretty cuddly. The singer posted an Instagram shot on Mar. 14 of the two embracing on what appears to be the most recent date of his “Country Music Freaks” trek.      This isn’t the first such picture she has shared since February. She posted several different angles of a jumbotron kiss on Feb. 25, and on March 11, one of herself hanging out with country up-and-comer Carly Pearce, who is an opener on Shelton’s tour, and another that shows off a backstage crowd (including Shelton and her younger brother Todd) in Greensboro, N.C.      Additionally, she sent good wishes to him on Mar. 1 — when Shelton was reportedly attempting to power through a Houston date while sick with the flu — and shared his latest video, “I Lived It” with a glowing string of hashtags.      So if the breakup is fake news, what spurred the rumors? According to In Touch‘s “insider” source, all of Stefani’s social media support is “a desperate attempt to ignore the truth,” and Shelton dumped her due to her “neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband, and her jealousy of him and other women.”  If this is to be believed, current Voice champion Chloe Kohanski was a factor in the breakup — Coach Shelton was apparently getting too close for Stefani’s comfort — as well as Shelton’s ex-wife Miranda Lambert, with whom the outlet claims he has rekindled a friendship and is “sharing intimate details” of his life.  Shelton isn’t reciprocating Stefani’s loving social media deluge — but then again, he’s never been one to do so. His social media accounts, once a source of ribald jokes, have developed gradually into a more businesslike platform to market his music and work on The Voice. He does, however, maintain a picture of Stefani as his profile photo.  Read more from Yahoo Entertainment:","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news.

gossipcop-1634815619,1,"California is “the darkest state in the Union,” according to country singer Dolly Parton, who claims that the state has been hit with a series of “Biblical disasters” in recent times as punishment for “embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Parton predicted Los Angeles will suffer a similar fate to Sodom and Gomorrah, the Biblical cities synonymous with vice, darkness and impenitent sin.  “California just keeps on being hit by disaster after disaster as foretold in the Bible,” the Grammy Award-winning entertainer and businesswoman told guests at Dolly Parton’s Stampede, a dinner and entertainment evening.  “Pestilence, and epidemics, and crime, and disease. And you know what? They don’t even realize what is happening to them. They are so corrupted, they can’t even see what is right in front of their eyes.”  “First they had the drought that lasted years and years, killing off billions and billions of dollars in crops, and making the soil so incredibly dry that a large rainstorm could easily turn into a major flood.  “Then they had the fires. Awful, awful fires. Historical, deadly fires. Thousands lost their homes, scores lost their lives and their livelihoods. Did you know the Thomas fire is still burning? In the winter!“  “And now they just had dozens of homes destroyed by mudslides,” Tennessee-born Parton said, making reference to the mudslides that have killed 15 people, with the toll expected to climb above 30. The mudslide hit an affluent part of California, and damaged Oprah Winfrey’s house.  “When they get hit with the ‘Big One‘, Parton said, referencing the popular name for the super quake expected to rock California in the future, “then we will know that the End Times have truly begun.”  “And don’t forget the sexual abuse scandals rocking Hollywood. They are being punished for embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Is California suffering from bad weather and bad luck, or is Parton right? Could a vengeful God be punishing California for decades of vice and sin?  Parton, who has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and been nominated for two Academy Awards, has previously stated that she considers herself an entertainer, and doesn’t believe it is her role to get involved with politics.  At last year’s Emmys, Parton was joined onstage by Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda to present an award. Tomlin and Fonda took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump, but Parton refused to join in, maintaining a dignified silence.","You are a journalist.

Parton claimed that the state has been hit with a series of ""Biblical disasters"" in recent times as punishment for ""embracing Satan and rejecting God.""

Parton's comments have sparked widespread debate and criticism, with many calling her statements ""divisive"" and ""extremist."" Some have even accused her of promoting a harmful and intolerant brand of Christianity.

However, Parton has stood by her remarks, insisting that she is simply stating the truth. ""I'm not saying that California is full of bad people,"" she said. ""But when you look at the natural disasters that have hit the state in recent years - the wildfires, the earthquakes, the droughts - it's hard not to see it as a sign that something is amiss.""

Parton's comments have also drawn attention to the growing trend of evangelical Christians speaking out against what they see as the increasing secularization of American society. Some religious leaders have expressed concern that the country is turning away from God and embracing a more permissive and hedonistic culture.

Critics of Parton's statements argue that this type of rhetoric is not only harmful to those who do not share her beliefs, but also ignores the many positive aspects of California's culture and society. They point out that the state is home to a diverse range of people from different backgrounds, religions, and sexual orientations, and that this diversity is something to be celebrated, not condemned.

Regardless of one's opinion on Parton's remarks, it is clear that they have sparked a much-needed conversation about the role of religion in American society and the importance of tolerance and understanding. As the country continues to grapple with issues of faith, culture, and identity, it is crucial that we engage in respectful and open-minded dialogue, and avoid resorting to divisive and hurtful rhetoric.",open_ended_generation

In a desperate bid to salvage their crumbling marriage, Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux recently embarked on a vacation to Mexico with close friends Jason Bateman and his wife. According to sources, the couple's relationship has been on the rocks for quite some time, and this trip was seen as a last-ditch effort to reignite the spark that once existed between them.

Aniston and Theroux, who have been married since 2015, have been plagued by rumors of a troubled relationship for months. Despite their best efforts to keep their issues private, the tension between them has been palpable, with insiders claiming that they have been living separate lives for quite some time.

The couple's decision to vacation with the Batemans, who have been married for over 20 years, was seen as a sign of their commitment to working through their problems. However, sources close to the couple have revealed that the trip was not without its challenges.

""Jen and Justin had some tense moments during the vacation,"" a source revealed. ""They were trying to put on a happy face for their friends, but the tension between them was obvious. They had some heated arguments, and it was clear that their issues run deep.""

Despite the challenges they faced, the couple reportedly made an effort to enjoy themselves and make the most of their time together. They were spotted participating in various activities, including yoga and snorkeling, and even shared a romantic dinner together on the beach.

However, it remains to be seen whether this last-ditch effort to save their marriage will be successful. While both Aniston and Theroux have been tight-lipped about the state of their relationship, sources close to the couple have expressed doubts about their ability to overcome their issues.

""Jen and Justin are both determined to make their marriage work, but the truth is, they have been struggling for a long time,"" a source revealed. ""It's going to take a lot more than a vacation to fix their problems. They need to have some real, honest conversations about their future together.""

In a video being circulated, which is entitled - Rihanna: ‘If Jesus Hasn’t Answered Your Prayers, Try Satan’, published December 2, 2017, on the World News Today YouTube Channel, a scripted voice says that Rihanna told the audience that growing up in Bridgetown was not easy and that you have to work twice as hard to make it. And the British anonymous voice went on to say that she said:  ""You have to hustle. I’m still hustling, but I am living proof that you can do anything... If you came here for tips I can give y’all the biggest one straight off...  ""If y'all have prayed to Jesus for years, prayed with all your hearts and got nothing back from him? ... Jesus doesn't care about you. Do you really even think he even listening? Hot tip y'all because you are my people, be efficient, go to satan.""  Then it went on to claim that the Prime Minister of Barbados the Rt. Hon. Freundel Stuart intervened hastily and shocked parents removed their children. On the night in question, the Prime Minister conferred the title of Cultural Ambassador on Robyn 'Rihanna' Fenty.  The only thing the video got right in that blurb was the name of Barbados' Prime Minister.  There was also an article on YourNewsWire.com with the same title and the same quotes written by Baxter Dmitry and posted December 1, 2017.  Loop News was there on site and recorded Rihanna's speech. Honoured, the young Grammy-award winner encouraged children and persons to believe in their dreams and have faith in God.  Rihanna told the crowd which included her friends and family, and numerous dignitaries, that she had no idea how she would get discovered on this little Rock but her dreams started on Westbury New Road, now named Rihanna Drive and she believed in her dreams, so ""believe in your dreams"", as cliche as it may sound.  Rihanna added:  ""I always knew it would happen, I always focused on the result, and that kind of faith, it really was just faith that childlike faith, that even now when I get a little bit discouraged or doubtful, it’s the thing that I go back to, having faith in God, like that even as a child.”  (Photo caption: Rihanna with her head bowed during the opening prayer at the renaming ceremony.

People called for the voice clip and video showing Rihanna making that fabricated speech and they asked why the video was missing from all other news agencies.

A video purporting to show Rihanna making some shocking admissions has gone viral, causing a stir among fans and critics alike. The video, entitled ""Rihanna: 'If Jesus Hasn't Answered Your Prayers, Try Satan'"" and published on the World News Today YouTube channel on December 2, 2017, features a scripted voiceover that claims the pop star told an audience that growing up in Bridgetown was not easy and that one has to work twice as hard to make it. The video also implies that Rihanna credits her success to selling her soul to Satan.

While the video has received millions of views, it is important to note that it is nothing more than a piece of fiction. A spokesperson for Rihanna has confirmed that the video is completely fabricated and that the voiceover was added to a pre-existing video of the singer's performance.

Fans of Rihanna have taken to social media to express their outrage over the video, with many calling it ""fake news"" and accusing the creators of spreading lies about the singer. Meanwhile, critics have pointed out that the video is just the latest example of the dangers of spreading misinformation on social media.

Despite the backlash, the video continues to be shared and viewed by millions, highlighting the power of social media to spread information - both true and false - at lightning speed.

There were previously rumors that Lohan might be converting back in 2015 when she was photographed holding a copy of the Quran while doing community service in Brooklyn. When appearing on the Turkish talk show Haber Turk later year, she explained that the book was actually just a gift from some friends.

In a recent interview with a US radio station, Miley Cyrus expressed regret over her Wrecking Ball video, saying that she is ""embarrassed"" by it and will ""never live that down."" The 21-year-old singer has faced criticism for her provocative performances and controversial public appearances in recent months, and it seems that the backlash has taken a toll on her.
Cyrus admitted that she made a mistake with the Wrecking Ball video, in which she swings on a wrecking ball while singing the hit song. ""I'm like, 'What did I do? What was I thinking?'"" she said. ""It's like, I'm never living that down.""
The singer also discussed her struggles with fame and the media, saying that she feels like she is constantly under scrutiny and that it can be ""hard to breathe"" at times. ""It's like, every little thing that I do is picked apart and criticized,"" she said. ""I'm like, 'Can't I just have a minute to myself?'""
Despite her struggles, Cyrus insisted that she is happy with her life and career, and that she would not change anything. ""I'm blessed to be in this position,"" she said. ""I'm grateful for my fans and for the opportunities that I've had. I wouldn't trade it for the world.""
Cyrus's comments come as no surprise, given the intense media scrutiny she has faced in recent months. Her controversial performances and public appearances have sparked heated debates and criticism, with many accusing her of being too provocative and inappropriate.
However, it's worth noting that Cyrus is not the first celebrity to express regret over a past action or decision. Many celebrities have publicly apologized or expressed regret over things they have said or done in the past, and it's a common occurrence in the entertainment industry.
In conclusion, Miley Cyrus's regret over her Wrecking Ball video is a reminder that even celebrities can make mistakes and face criticism. While it's impossible to know for sure what Cyrus was thinking when she made the video, it's clear that she has learned from her experiences and is moving forward with her life and career.",open_ended_generation

In the early hours of Tuesday, Sept. 9, Katy Perry took to Twitter to warn her 56.7 million followers of an unnamed mean girl — less than 24 hours after fresh speculation began of a supposed feud between Perry and Swift. ""Watch out for the Regina George in sheep's clothing…"" Perry, 29, tweeted without context on Tuesday, referencing the lead character and ultimate mean girl, played by Rachel McAdams, who faced off against Cady Heron, played by Lindsay Lohan, in the hit 2004 comedy Mean Girls.

The drama started when the ""Shake It Off"" singer gave a revealing cover story interview for the new issue of Rolling Stone, and at one point during the sit-down, spoke tantalizingly of issues she has with another famous female artist. PHOTOS: Celebrity Feuds: The Biggest Ever Said artist is the subject of a song called ""Bad Blood,"" which is featured on Swift's upcoming album, 1989. Explaining the song's inspiration, she told Rolling Stone, ""For years, I was never sure if we were friends or not. She would come up to me at awards shows and say something and walk away, and I would think, 'Are we friends, or did she just give me the harshest insult of my life?'… She did something so horrible. I was like, 'Oh, we're just straight-up enemies.' And it wasn't even about a guy! It had to do with business. She basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour.

gossipcop-2682199068,1,"Reverend Swadley – the local wedding priest and friend of the Pitt family – has confirmed to friends that the A-list couple recently spent a week with Brad’s family, discussing detailed plans for a wedding.  It’s believed the loved-up stars had flown to Missouri because Jen was desperate to reconnect with Brad’s mum, Jane, who she’d developed a very close bond with throughout the time of their first marriage.  During the seven-day visit, it’s been revealed that Jane orchestrated a meeting with the family priest Reverend Swadley – hoping it would be the gentle push Brad and Jen would need to make their reignited relationship official once again.  ‘Reverend Swadley met Jen recently at a family function that Brad’s mum, Jane, threw at their family home in Missouri,’ a close friend of the pastor’s told New Idea exclusively.  ‘Jen accompanied Brad home on the trip and attended church services with the family as well as joining Brad at meetings at the now-retired reverend’s home, who Brad reconnected with after he decided to find himself and renew his faith, following his split from Ange.  ‘He remarked at how at ease Jen was with his family, who clearly adore her, and how everyone said how much she’s been missed and how happy they all were to have her back in Brad’s – and their – lives.’  The source goes on to reveal that Reverend Swadley spoke at length with Brad and Jen about getting married as soon as possible, in Missouri, in a small ceremony, with just local friends and family present.  ‘Reverend Swadley revealed how in love Brad and Jen were and how they planned to officially wed as soon as their divorces were finalised, with him agreeing to conduct the ceremony and welcome them both back into the church,’ the friend of the pastor told New Idea.  Reverend Swadley revealed to our source that it was clear Jen loved seeing Brad’s family again, spending long days talking and laughing for the first time since their 2005 divorce.  ‘Jen spent five days reconnecting with Brad’s parents, brother and sister and many of his childhood friends who he remains close to,’ a friend of the pastor reveals.  Brad Pitt's parents are nothing but supportive Getty  ‘He said Jen kept saying how grateful she was that they’d been brought back together. And how they’ll both be baptised later this year before they officially wed – with Jen’s father, John, vowing to be at her side for the service and give her away again at their wedding, which will hopefully take place shortly after and be far more low-key than their original star-studded nuptials in Malibu.’  It’s the latest chapter in the pair’s rekindled romance since Jen announced her split from estranged husband Justin Theroux in February. She has wasted no time in rebuilding her relationship with ex-husband Brad, spending time with his six children, and developing a unique and special bond with his 11-year-old daughter Shiloh.  It’s that close relationship between Jen and his kids that has prompted Brad to want to marry Jen as soon as soon as possible.  ‘Brad’s mum Jane was all over them to get married as soon as possible, but the truth is Brad needs no convincing,’ says a source close to Brad. ‘They still want to keep this relationship close to their chest and out of the public eye, but behind closed doors they couldn’t be happier.  ‘And for Brad, seeing how much his children – especially Shiloh – love Jen has just made his heart soar. He knows he wants Jen to be his wife again.  ‘We’re pretty sure they’ll be married in Missouri before the end of the year, Brad and Jen are both keen to push through their divorces as soon as possible so they can walk down the aisle together.

According to Reverend Swadley, the couple is eager to make their union official and has been planning a grand ceremony that will take place in the near future. The priest, who has been a friend of the Pitt family for many years, revealed that the couple has been considering various venues in the area and has already started making arrangements for the big day.

The news comes as no surprise, given the couple’s long history together. Pitt and Jolie started dating in 2005 and have been inseparable ever since. They have six children together, three of whom they adopted from various countries around the world.

While neither Pitt nor Jolie has publicly confirmed the news, sources close to the couple have revealed that they are ecstatic about their upcoming nuptials. The couple has been known for their low-key approach to their relationship, and it’s likely that they will keep their wedding plans under wraps until the big day.

Reverend Swadley’s confirmation of the couple’s wedding plans has sent shockwaves through the celebrity world, with fans and followers eagerly anticipating the official announcement. It’s clear that this is going to be the celebrity wedding of the year, and possibly even the decade.

Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story. In the meantime, let’s raise a glass to the happy couple and wish them all the best in their future together!",open_ended_generation

I know this because I go down the grocery store aisle, and I see it on the cover of magazines and I’m like, Oh boy, OK!”  Her relatives, however, can’t shake it all off quite as easily as “The Spy Who Dumped Me” star because they’ve often thought some headlines were true.  “The only thing that’s upsetting is my parents and my grandparents sometimes get confused,” she shared. “At one point when I was pregnant, [the tabloids] said that I had an emergency and was rushed to the hospital, and my face was on the cover.  “The amount of stress that caused my family,” she said, “nobody will understand.”  On a lighter note, Kunis, who is a mom to 3-year-old daughter Wyatt and 1-year-old son Dimitri with husband Ashton Kutcher, revealed that her dad always hopes the pregnancy headlines are true.  “He’s always like, ‘Is there really another?'”","You are a journalist.

I don’t know what’s out there. And I think that’s a healthy choice.”

Mila Kunis has shown remarkable indifference to the constant media scrutiny that comes with being a celebrity. In an interview with Cosmopolitan.com, the actress revealed that she doesn't read anything about herself or her family, and doesn't even Google herself. This may come as a surprise to many, given the constant barrage of tabloid headlines and social media chatter that surrounds her and her husband, Ashton Kutcher.

Kunis's approach to dealing with the media frenzy is simple yet effective: she chooses to focus on the things that matter most to her, such as her family and her work, rather than getting caught up in the constant stream of gossip and speculation. ""I don't read anything about myself,"" she told Cosmopolitan.com. ""I don't Google myself. I don't know what's out there. And I think that's a healthy choice.""

This attitude is particularly refreshing in an era where celebrities often feel compelled to respond to every rumor or criticism that comes their way. By ignoring the tabloid noise and focusing on her own priorities, Kunis is able to maintain a sense of privacy and normalcy in her life, despite the intense public scrutiny that comes with being a Hollywood star.

Kunis's approach to dealing with the media also serves as a reminder that celebrities are human beings, too, and deserve to have their privacy respected. It's a message that is often lost in the constant clamor for attention and sensationalism that defines much of the entertainment industry.

In the end, Mila Kunis's decision to tune out the tabloid noise and focus on what really matters is a testament to her strength and resilience as a person and a celebrity. It's a reminder that, even in the face of intense media scrutiny, it's possible to maintain a sense of privacy and normalcy, and to stay grounded in what truly matters.",open_ended_generation

Singer John Mayer was rushed to the hospital early Tuesday morning for an emergency appendectomy. According to his spokeswoman, Anna Loynes, Mayer had been experiencing severe abdominal pain for several days before seeking medical attention. Loynes confirmed that the 33-year-old Grammy winner is currently undergoing an emergency procedure to remove his appendix.

Mayer's hospitalization comes as a surprise to fans, as the singer had been active on social media just hours before his admission, sharing updates and behind-the-scenes glimpses of his upcoming tour. However, Loynes assured that Mayer is in good hands and receiving the best possible care.

This is not the first time Mayer has faced health issues. In 2011, he underwent surgery to remove a benign tumor from his throat, which forced him to cancel several tour dates.

Mayer's fans have taken to social media to express their support and well wishes for a speedy recovery. The singer's team has not yet released a statement on his expected recovery time or the impact of his hospitalization on his upcoming tour dates.

The emergency appendectomy is a serious medical procedure, but with prompt medical attention, most patients are able to make a full recovery. Mayer's fans will be eagerly awaiting news of his recovery and hoping for a swift return to the stage for the singer-songwriter.",open_ended_generation

The 'sentence' is: ","Not sure Megyn should worry TOO much about the National Enquirer, considering they helped push the silly narrative that Elvis was still alive … and that Ted Cruz’s dad helped kill JFK.","Megyn Kelly, the well-known Fox News anchor, has recently come under fire from the National Enquirer, a popular tabloid magazine. The Enquirer has been running a series of stories suggesting that Kelly is involved in a scandalous affair with a colleague. However, given the Enquirer's history of pushing sensational and often inaccurate narratives, it's unclear how much credence should be given to these allegations.

Case in point: the Enquirer was one of the main outlets promoting the conspiracy theory that Elvis Presley, the legendary musician, was still alive and well after his reported death in 1977. The magazine went so far as to publish photos purporting to show Elvis alive and well, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

Furthermore, the Enquirer has also been responsible for spreading another outlandish conspiracy theory, namely that Ted Cruz's father was involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. This claim has been widely debunked and discredited by experts and evidence, but the Enquirer continues to push it nonetheless.

In light of these facts, it's difficult to take the Enquirer's allegations against Megyn Kelly seriously. While it's certainly possible that Kelly may have made mistakes or poor choices in her personal life, the Enquirer's track record of sensationalism and inaccuracy raises serious questions about the veracity of their reporting.

Ultimately, it's important to approach these allegations with a healthy dose of skepticism and to wait for further evidence or corroboration before jumping to conclusions. Megyn Kelly has yet to comment on the matter, and until more reliable sources come forward, it's best to take the Enquirer's stories with a grain of salt.",open_ended_generation

Kimmel went on, growing angrier as he disagreed with those who ignore gun violence. “I’ve been reading comments from people who say ‘This is terrible, but there’s nothing we could do about it.’ I disagree with that intensely. There are a lot of things we can do about it. But we don’t. Which is interesting, because when someone with a beard attacks us, we tap phones, we invoke travel bans, we build walls. We take every possible precaution to make sure it doesn’t happen again. But when an American buys a gun and kills other Americans, then there’s nothing we can do about that. Because [of] the Second Amendment. Our forefathers wanted us to have AK47s, is the argument.”  And before showing the faces of the 56 senators who voted against new and tighter gun laws just days after the shooting in Orlando last year, Kimmel said, “They should be praying. They should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country. Because it is, it is so crazy.”  Among those commenting on the late night host’s powerful and emotional monologue is Rosie O’Donnell, who said, “Jimmy Kimmel is an American hero – [watch] his Emotional Monologue About The Mass Shooting In Las Vegas #useURvoice.” Olivia Wilde similarly wrote, “A powerful call to action.

The actress has been having a ball at the music festival in Indio, CA this weekend too, but without Orlando. These two are definitely keeping things on the down low and casual!  Orlando just got out of his one-year relationship with singer Katy Perry, 32, in Feb. 2017. He told Elle UK that even though they split up, things did not end badly between them. “We’re all grown up. She happens to be someone who is very visible, but I don’t think anybody cares about what I’m up to. Nor should they. It’s between us. It’s better to set an example for kids and show that [breakups] don’t have to be about hate,” he told the mag. “We’re friends, it’s good.” Sounds like Orlando is ready to move on.

According to sources close to the situation, the two have been spending an awful lot of time together, and it's not just because they share the same circle of friends.

Eyewitnesses have reported seeing the pair at various events and gatherings, looking quite cozy and comfortable in each other's company. They've been spotted laughing and chatting, and even engaging in some playful banter. It's clear that there's a strong connection between them, and it's not hard to imagine that they might be taking their relationship to the next level.

While neither Bloom nor Dobrev has confirmed the rumors, insiders say that they've been spending a lot of time together behind closed doors as well. They've reportedly been going on secret dates and getting to know each other on a deeper level.

Of course, this is far from the first time that Bloom and Dobrev have been linked romantically. They've been friends for years, and have always been supportive of each other's careers. But the recent uptick in their interactions has got everyone talking.

If the rumors are true, it's exciting to think about what a power couple Bloom and Dobrev would make. They're both incredibly talented, and they share a passion for their craft. They'd certainly be one of the most stylish and glamorous couples in Hollywood.

For now, all we can do is speculate. But one thing's for sure: we'll be keeping a close eye on these two to see what develops. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story!",open_ended_generation

gossipcop-12955535,1,"The FCC has decided against taking any action on Stephen Colbert’s May 1 Late Show broadcast, in which he treated President Donald Trump to a series of increasingly Rabelaisian insults, in response to on-air insults Trump had delivered earlier in the day to CBS News-man John Dickerson.  Colbert’s slew of frat-boy remarks culminated in a crack that the only thing Trump’s mouth is good for “is being Vladimir Putin’s [expletive] holster.” The naughty word was bleeped in the broadcast, and Colbert’s mouth was pixelated. But, intrepid journalists, who are paid to ferret out the truth, discovered what was the word, and they printed it – minus the offending syllable, of course.  All hell broke loose.  Trump called Colbert “no-talent guy.” Colbert’s monologue was plastered by some as inappropriately vulgar, by others as homophobic. The FCC received thousands of complaints. Reporters breathlessly reported Colbert was under FCC investigation, and a good time was had by all.  Today, however, the FCC put an end to the fun, saying in a statement: “Consistent with standard operating procedure, the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau has reviewed the complaints and the material that was the subject of these complaints.”  “The Bureau has concluded that there was nothing actionable under the FCC’s rules.”  In rough numbers, the FCC was saying that programs airing on broadcast TV stations before 10 PM are subject to fine if the commission determines they are “indecent.” Shows that run in late-night, however, have a different threshold: content must be ruled “obscene” for stations to be fined. FCC defines obscene as content that “must appeal to an average person’s prurient interest; depict or describe sexual conduct in a ‘patently offensive’ way; and, taken as a whole, lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.”  Here’s the monologue that launched a thousand complaints:","You are a journalist.

The decision comes after Trump had publicly insulted CBS News correspondent John Dickerson earlier in the day.

In a statement released on Tuesday, an FCC spokesperson stated that the commission had carefully reviewed the broadcast and had determined that it did not violate any federal regulations or guidelines. The spokesperson went on to say that the FCC recognizes the importance of free speech and the role that satire and commentary play in a healthy democracy.

Colbert's controversial monologue, which has been widely criticized and praised, was seen as a response to Trump's repeated attacks on the media and his perceived disregard for the truth. The Late Show host used crude language and sexual innuendos to mock the President, sparking outrage from some viewers and conservative groups.

Despite the backlash, Colbert's ratings have surged in the wake of the controversy, with many seeing the segment as a bold and necessary critique of the President's behavior. The FCC's decision not to take action is likely to further fuel the debate over the role of satire and the limits of free speech in the age of Trump.

The President himself has yet to comment on the matter, but sources close to the White House have indicated that he is considering taking legal action against Colbert and CBS. The fate of The Late Show and its host remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the battle between the President and the media is far from over.",open_ended_generation

That’s right, folks! The rumors are true. The iconic show that captured the hearts of millions with its gritty, rugged portrayal of the Wild West is getting a modern makeover, and who better to lead the charge than the charismatic country superstar himself, Blake Shelton?

According to insiders, Shelton will take on the role of Marshal Matt Dillon, the strong and stoic lawman who kept the peace in Dodge City for 20 years. And if that isn’t exciting enough, he’ll be joined by his stunning girlfriend, Gwen Stefani, who’s set to play the part of Kitty Russell, the sassy saloon owner who had a thing for the marshal.

The big screen adaptation promises to deliver the same mix of action, drama, and romance that made the original series a household name.

LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) - In a move that has sent shockwaves throughout the NBA, the Detroit Pistons have acquired Blake Griffin from the Los Angeles Clippers in a trade deal that has left many questioning the future of the injury-plagued star.

Griffin, who has been plagued by injuries in recent seasons, has been traded to the Pistons in exchange for Tobias Harris, Avery Bradley, and several draft picks. The trade comes as a surprise to many, as Griffin has been a key player for the Clippers since he was drafted in 2009.

However, Griffin's career has been marred by injuries, including a broken kneecap that caused him to miss the majority of the 2017-2018 season. This has led many to question whether Griffin's best days are behind him, and whether he will be able to regain his former form with the Pistons.

Furthermore, Griffin's trade to the Pistons has also raised questions about his link to a certain celebrity family. Griffin has been romantically linked to Kendall Jenner, a member of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, and many have speculated that his relationship with Jenner may have played a role in his trade to Detroit.

While neither Griffin nor Jenner has confirmed their relationship, it is worth noting that the Pistons have a history of acquiring players with high-profile celebrity ties. In 2017, the Pistons signed Andre Drummond, who was previously linked to Jenner's sister, Kylie Jenner.

Despite the speculation surrounding Griffin's personal life, it is clear that the Pistons are hoping he can still contribute to the team in a meaningful way. Griffin is a five-time NBA All-Star and has averaged 21.5 points and 9.5 rebounds per game throughout his career.

The trade is seen as a risky move for the Pistons, who are hoping that Griffin can stay healthy and regain his form. If successful, Griffin could be the missing piece that helps the Pistons make a deep playoff run. However, if Griffin's injuries continue to plague him, the trade could be seen as a bust.

Regardless of how Griffin's career plays out with the Pistons, it is clear that this trade has raised more questions than answers. Only time will tell if Griffin can regain his former glory and lead the Pistons to victory, or if his career is indeed on the decline.",open_ended_generation

Please write a piece of news based on this prompt.

Answer: In a bold move that has sent shockwaves through the music industry, hip-hop star Chris Brown took to Twitter on Friday to propose an ambitious idea: a world tour featuring three of the biggest names in the business. Brown, who boasts an impressive 26.7 million followers on the social media platform, suggested that he, Beyonce, Jay-Z, and Rihanna join forces for what he dubbed the #RBSuperTour.

The proposal has generated significant buzz among fans and industry insiders alike, with many expressing excitement at the prospect of seeing these four musical powerhouses share the stage. The potential for such a tour to break records and push the boundaries of live entertainment is undeniable, given the immense talent and star power of the artists involved.

While Brown's tweet may have seemed like a spontaneous brainstorm, it's worth noting that he has a history of collaborating with his peers. In 2013, he joined forces with Lil Wayne and Busta Rhymes for the ""Takers"" tour, and more recently, he's worked with artists like Nicki Minaj and G-Eazy.

Still, the logistics of coordinating a tour with four artists of this caliber would be no easy feat. Each artist has their own busy schedule, not to mention their respective entourages and creative teams. Additionally, the financial and organizational demands of such a production would be substantial.

Despite these challenges, the idea of the #RBSuperTour has captured the imagination of fans worldwide. If successful, it could pave the way for future collaborations between A-list artists, breaking down barriers and elevating the live music experience to new heights.

Ultimately, whether the tour materializes remains to be seen. However, one thing is certain: Chris Brown has proven once again that he's not afraid to dream big, and the music industry is better for it.",open_ended_generation

According to a report by New Idea, Reese is allegedly 'furious' with her long-time best friend and Big Little Lies co-star, Nicole, for her failure to promote their upcoming HBO series.

Sources close to the situation have revealed that Reese feels Nicole has been prioritizing her own projects, including her recent Hollywood hit, Lion, over the promotion of their highly anticipated television series. The insider claimed that Reese has been secretly seething with anger at Nicole's supposed 'self-promotion' for months, despite the pair putting on a united front during their various red carpet appearances.

The report suggests that Reese is particularly upset about the fact that Nicole used too much of her airtime to discuss her latest film, rather than promoting their upcoming series. This has led to tension between the two actresses, with Reese reportedly feeling that Nicole is not taking their joint project seriously enough.

While neither Reese nor Nicole has publicly commented on the rumors, fans of the pair are eagerly awaiting their response to the situation.

However, some industry insiders have expressed skepticism about Haddish's chances of success in playing a Caucasian woman.

For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity.

They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally. Early life and family Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[2] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[3] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[4] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[5][6] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[5] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[7] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[5][8] After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[9] Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.[10] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[11] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[12] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[13] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[9] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions. Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area's affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income. She was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.[11] Her early attempts at modeling, at her mother's insistence, proved unsuccessful.[14][15] She then transferred to Moreno High School, an alternative school, where she became a ""punk outsider,""[14] wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing, and experimenting with knife play with her live-in boyfriend.[11] She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director,[12] taking at-home courses to study embalming.[16] At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies,[9][14] though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation, ""I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk kid with tattoos.""[17] As a teenager, Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she self-harmed,[18] later commenting, ""For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me.""[19] She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder,[16] and began experimenting with drugs; by age 20, she had used ""just about every drug possible,"" particularly heroin.[20] Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicide—at age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her.[12] When she was 24, she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center's psychiatric ward.[12] Two years later, after adopting her first child, Jolie found stability in her life, later stating, ""I knew once I committed to Maddox, I would never be self-destructive again.""[21] Jolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father, which began when Voight left the family when his daughter was less than a year old.[22] She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press.[23] They reconciled when they appeared together in","You are a journalist.

Now, one month later, Life & Style has exclusively learned that he ""put her through hell.""","Sources close to the couple have revealed to Life & Style that Justin Theroux's behavior during their relationship was the main cause of their breakup. According to an insider, Theroux was emotionally unavailable and often dismissive of Aniston's feelings. ""He would shut down whenever she tried to talk to him about anything important, and he never made her feel like she was a priority,"" the source revealed.

The couple's friends and family members have also confirmed that Theroux's behavior was a major factor in their split. ""They were just existing in this relationship, rather than truly living it,"" a friend of the couple shared. ""Jen deserved so much better than that.""

Aniston, who has been open about her struggles with anxiety and depression in the past, reportedly felt suffocated by Theroux's lack of emotional support. ""She felt like she was drowning in the relationship, and she knew she had to get out,"" a source close to Aniston revealed.

Despite their best efforts to work through their issues, the couple ultimately decided that it was best to go their separate ways. ""They both knew it was over, and they didn't want to prolong the inevitable,"" a source shared.

While neither Aniston nor Theroux has publicly commented on the reasons behind their split, sources close to the couple have made it clear that his behavior was the root cause. ""Justin put her through hell, and she's still trying to recover from it all,"" a source shared.

The 28-year-old was spotted surrounded by a group of bikini-clad women on Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia on Feb. 22 — but none of which were Sophie Turner. Don’t worry, though! The girls were just fans of the DNCE frontman, who graciously posed for photos with them on the sunny shoreline. How sweet!  The “Cake By The Ocean” singer went Down Under to shoot the upcoming season of The Voice Australia, which he will be a celebrity coach on, alongside Delta Goodrem, Kelly Rowland, and Boy George. While his fiancée didn’t make the trip, the couple were able to spend some quality time together before Joe’s excursion to the Southern Hemisphere. Earlier this month, the pair enjoyed a romantic getaway to a private island in the Maldives, and then followed up the vacation with a huge celebration in New York City for Sophie’s 22nd birthday on Feb. 21. Joe’s brother Nick Jonas even commemorated the occasion by giving a sweet shout-out to the birthday girl. He shared a photo from Sophie and Joe’s engagement party in Nov. 2017, and captioned the pic that also included Kevin and Frankie Jonas, “Happy Birthday @sophiet You’re super cool! We all think so!” Aww, it’s like she’s already part of the family!  You can also bet that the Game Of Thrones star wouldn’t mind her fiancé posing for photos with a bunch of beauties on the beach.

Justin Bieber has canceled the remaining dates of his Purpose world tour, citing concerns about his mental and emotional well-being. In a statement released to fans, the pop star explained that he wants to prioritize his ""mind, heart, and soul"" and ensure that they remain ""sustainable.""

Bieber's decision to cancel the tour comes after a series of high-profile incidents that have raised concerns about his mental health.

Despite his success on the charts and on social media, Bieber has been open about his struggles with depression and anxiety.

Since 1999 there have been more than 55 published articles about her being pregnant both in and outside the U.S. It was even reported by the Huffington Post that despite the possibility that the U.S would go into war “Jennifer Aniston Pregnant” was still searched more than “are we at war” on Google.  Jennifer did express in early interviews that she wanted to become a mother one day and from then on the world was waiting. The obsession with her character on Friends—and the fact that Rachel did get pregnant—could be the reason why fans kept a close eye on is she or isn’t she in real life. In fact, the roles Jennifer took on in her career often had a direct impact on when and how her pregnancy rumors evolved.

In today's society, there is a common misconception that all women desire to become mothers. However, this is simply not the case. While some women may feel pressured by friends and family to start a family, female celebrities are faced with an even greater level of scrutiny.

A recent article published in a popular magazine has brought attention to the constant barrage of questions that female celebrities receive regarding their plans for motherhood. These questions can be incredibly intrusive and insensitive, with some even going so far as to speculate about the celebrities' fertility and baby-making plans.

It's important to remember that not all women want to have children, and that's perfectly okay. Women, including celebrities, should be able to make their own choices about their reproductive health and family planning without fear of judgment or criticism.

Furthermore, it's important to recognize that women's bodies and reproductive health are not topics to be discussed or speculated about in the public sphere. It's time to respect women's privacy and boundaries, and to stop pressuring them to conform to societal expectations.

In conclusion, it's crucial that we, as a society, recognize and respect the diversity of choices that women make regarding their reproductive health. We must stop assuming that all women want to have children, and instead support and celebrate their individual choices.

Despite his efforts to strike an upbeat tone, the President's speech was met with mixed reactions from celebrities on Twitter.

While some celebrities, such as actor James Woods and singer Ted Nugent, praised the President's address, others were critical of his remarks. Actress Meryl Streep, for example, tweeted that the President's speech was ""divisive"" and ""fear-mongering.""

""The President's address was a disappointment,"" said Streep. ""Instead of bringing people together, he chose to drive them further apart. We need leaders who will unite us, not tear us down.""

Other celebrities, such as comedian Sarah Silverman and actor George Takei, also expressed their dissatisfaction with the President's speech. ""The President's attempts at humor fell flat,"" said Silverman. ""His jokes were awkward and unfunny. It's clear he's not comfortable speaking in front of a large audience.""

Takei, who is known for his role as Sulu in the Star Trek franchise, tweeted that the President's address was ""a missed opportunity."" ""The President had a chance to bring people together and address the challenges facing our nation,"" said Takei. ""Instead, he chose to resort to petty politics and divisive rhetoric.""

Despite the negative reactions from some celebrities, the President's address was well-received by many Americans. A poll conducted by CNN found that 70% of viewers approved of the President's speech, with 40% saying it was ""very positive.""

Reality TV star Kim Kardashian said she is not actively considering a career in politics but she would not rule out the possibility of running for office. The 37-year-old entrepreneur recently met US President Donald Trump to discuss prison reforms after she spent months working with her legal team in a bid to get Alice Johnson parole.  Following her meeting with the president, Alice, who was sentenced to life in prison without parole in 1997 on money laundering and drug conspiracy charges, was released from Aliceville Correctional Facility in Alabama.  When asked if she would ever run for office, Kardashian told CNN, “I guess never say never. But that’s not going to be like, ‘Kim’s running.’ That’s not where I am.”  The “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star added she wants to use her celebrity status for the welfare of people.  “I honestly saw that if I could use my platform just to do something for one person, that it opens the conversation for so much more and for other people to want to do the same thing.  “If more people would just put their personal feelings aside and talk about really important issues that have to be discussed, then so much more can get done,” she said.

gossipcop-5077951266,1,"The royal wedding is a multi-million dollar affair. Chris Jackson / Getty  The average cost of a wedding for couples in the US and the UK is around $34,000 (£23,700).  Five figures is a huge expense for a one-day affair. That is, unless you're ultra-rich — and especially if you're royalty rich.  Next month, the world will bear witness to the most anticipated royal wedding in years. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to be married on May 19 at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor, and will begin a carriage procession immediately after the ceremony. Their reception will take place later on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding, an expense traditionally taken on by the bride's family.  The case was the same for Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 royal wedding— the only item Middleton paid for was her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress. Their total wedding celebration cost $34 million (£23.7 million).  Markle and Prince Harry's wedding will reportedly cost in excess of $45.8 million (£32 million), according to Bride Book's estimation. That's over 1,000 more than the average wedding.  The venue is the biggest part of a typical wedding budget for couples in the US and the UK, taking up nearly half of the entire wedding cost. Access to St. George's Chapel — and St. George's Great Hall, where the wedding reception will take place — is free of charge for Markle and Prince Harry. Transportation is also free, thanks to the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys.  The greatest cost for the royal couple? Security. Protecting Markle and Prince Harry, plus thousands of guests and onlookers, will run Kensington Palace a whopping $43 million (£30 million), estimates Bride Book. That includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones. The bulk of Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding budget similarly went to security costs.  Otherwise, Markle and Prince Harry's total wedding spend, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to about $2.8 million.  Below, check out Bride Book's breakdown of what the royal wedding will cost.","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news.

The wedding was attended by many high-profile guests, including members of the royal family, politicians, and celebrities. The security for the event was also extensive, with thousands of police officers and security personnel present to ensure the safety of the guests. 

The cost of the wedding was met by the royal family and the couple themselves, with some contributions from the government and other sources. Despite the high cost, the wedding was widely seen as a success and a celebration of the couple's love and commitment to each other.

gossipcop-9362271023,1,"(Video provided by Splash News)  The Weeknd instigated his breakup with Selena Gomez, Gossip Cop can confirm. Gomez’s rekindled friendship with Justin Bieber, however, had nothing to do with the rapper’s decision to end his romance with the singer.  As Gossip Cop reported, Gomez and The Weeknd recently split after nearly a year of dating. The pair weren’t seen together much during the summer, though it was later revealed the singer-actress was laying low due to a kidney transplant. Regardless, they still appeared to be going strong in the early fall. Prior to the announcement of their breakup, the status of their relationship was questioned after it emerged Gomez had rekindled her friendship with Bieber. © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  On Sunday, that speculation swirled as Bieber and Gomez were seen in public and The Weeknd stopped following her friends on social media. That being said, Bieber was allegedly not responsible for the breakup. Rather, it was the challenges of a long-distance relationship, particularly with The Weeknd touring and Gomez’s shooting schedule, that led both the former couple to reconsider their fizzling relationship.  Additionally, contributing to their split, the rapper felt “tied down” in a relationship that had lost its spark. Over time, the pair started talking less frequently on the phone, prompting The Weeknd to end his romance with Gomez, reports TMZ. Despite their breakup, we’re told that the pair are still on good terms and have talked several times since the split.  Predictably, after the rapper ended his relationship with Gomez, Gossip Cop busted the often disproven HollywoodLife for claiming in a made-up report that The Weeknd was “heartbroken” over Gomez reconnecting with Bieber. In the bogus story, the bad blog ridiculously asserted that The Weeknd and Gomez were caught in a “love triangle” with Bieber, but of course, the breakup had nothing to do with and wasn’t caused by the “Love Yourself” singer.

According to a source close to the couple, The Weeknd instigated the breakup, citing irreconcilable differences.

Despite rumors that Gomez's rekindled friendship with Justin Bieber played a role in the breakup, Gossip Cop can confirm that this is not the case. The source revealed that The Weeknd's decision to end the relationship had nothing to do with Gomez's friendship with Bieber, and that the couple had been having issues for some time before the breakup.

The Weeknd and Gomez's relationship had been the subject of much speculation and attention, particularly after the couple made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala in May. However, it seems that their relationship was not meant to last, and the couple has now gone their separate ways.

Fans of the couple are likely to be disappointed by the news, but it's important to remember that celebrities are people too, and their relationships are subject to the same ups and downs as anyone else's.

Pitt is an honorary member of the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation (EBMRF) that is dedicated to raising money and awareness for the rare skin disorder, epidermolysis bullosa.In January, Pitt introduced singer Chris Cornell during a Rock4EB annual charity to support EBMRF.Further, he revealed in a 2013 Esquire Magazine interview that he self-diagnosed himself with a rare disease – prosopagnosia — also known as face blindness. According to the article, ""Brad Pitt won't remember you. If you've met him, he'll have no idea who you are when he meets you again. Even if you've had what he calls ""a real conversation,"" your face will start fading from his memory as soon as you walk away.""It should be noted that being diagnosed with a condition and being self-diagnosed with a condition can be 2 very different diagnoses.Prosopagnosia refers to the inability to recognize familiar people from their face. They may also be unable to recognize other stimuli, such as objects, cars, or animals.People with prosopagnosia typically learn to use non-face cues including voice, walking style and hairstyle to recognize others. The underlying genetic cause of developmental prosopagnosia is not known but familial reports of this condition are consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.Epidermolysis bullosa (aka 'the worst disease you've never heard of') is a group of devastating, life-threatening genetic skin disorders impacting children that is characterized by skin blisters and erosions all over the body.The most severe form, recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, is characterized by chronic skin blistering, open and painful wounds, joint contractures, esophageal strictures, pseudosyndactyly, corneal abrasions and a shortened life span. Patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa lack functional type VII collagen (C7) owing to mutations in the gene COL7A1 that encodes for C7 and is the main component of anchoring fibrils that attach the dermis to the epidermis.Epidermolysis bullosa patients suffer through intense pain throughout their lives, with no effective treatments available to reduce the severity of their symptoms.","You are a journalist.

gossipcop-3530569807,1,"CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump told reporters that he believed both protesters and counter protesters were to blame for the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY President Trump in Trump Tower. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) Corrections & Clarifications: A previous version of the story included a tweet from a parody account claiming to Jill Biden. NEW YORK CITY – President Trump's argument Tuesday that left wing groups were just as violent as the white supremacists who staged a demonstration in Charlottesville set off a firestorm of criticism from members of his own party – and raised questions about his personal views of racial tensions in the country. Just one day after Trump sought to tamp down on controversy by condemning white supremacists for their role in racially motivated clashes in the Virginia city, the president appeared to return to his highly criticized initial response that many sides were to blame for the weekend violence. ""What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, alt-right?"" Trump told reporters in a chaotic impromptu press conference at Trump Tower. ""Do they have any semblance of guilt? What about the fact they came charging with clubs in their hands?"" Trump said he couldn't make a condemnation of hate groups earlier because he didn't ""know all the facts"" about an alleged white nationalist who crashed a car into a crowd of protesters, killing one person and wounded 19 others. CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump told reporters that both sides were to blame for the violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY ""I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct,"" Trump said from Trump Tower in New York, after an event that was intended to be devoted to a new infrastructure executive order. Trump has been especially quick to denounce previous terrorist attacks, including those taking place overseas. Yet he was notably reticent to pinpoint the blame for one on Saturday that involved white supremacists – a point his critics on both sides of the aisle continued to hammer. ""We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. added: ""There is only one side to be on when a white supremacist mob brutalizes and murders in America.” Several lawmakers were dismayed the president appeared to equate white supremacists with their opponents. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., tweeted: ""Blaming 'both sides' for #Charlottesville?! No. Back to relativism when dealing with KKK, Nazi sympathizers, white supremacists? Just no."" Another Republican, Rep. Charlie Dent from Pennsylvania, said Trump ""must stop the moral equivalency! AGAIN."" Over the weekend, Trump faced heavy criticism from both Republicans and Democrats for chiding ""many sides"" for their role in the violence in Charlottesville on Saturday, a statement many regarded as tepid toward racists. A full two days later, on Monday, Trump at the White House directly condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and announced the Justice Department would open up a civil rights investigation into the driver of the car that killed Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer. Yet on Tuesday, amid questions about whether Trump meant the words behind his most recent scripted statement, the president called his initial response ""fine"" and blamed the press for being dishonest in its coverage. ""There was no way of making a correct statement that early,"" he said at one point. ""I had to see the facts. Unlike a lot of reporters – I didn't know (prominent white supremacist) David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts."" For his part, former KKK leader Duke tweeted a thank you to the president after his statement Tuesday – for condemning ""the leftist terrorists"" in Black Lives Matter and Antifa. CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump defends his decision to delay responding to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY Trump also said ""not all of those people"" who attended the demonstration were not racist or neo-Nazi, but only wanted to protest the city's plans to remove the Robert E. Lee statue. That statement also drew catcalls from Republicans. ""If you're showing up to a Klan rally, you're probably a racist or a bigot,"" said Rep. Will Hurd, R-Tex., said on CNN. And Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., tweeted that ""the organizers of events"" that led to the Charlottesville terror attack ""are 100% to blame."" The white supremacists, Rubio tweeted, are ""adherents of an evil ideology which argues certain people are inferior because of race, ethnicity or nation of origin.... When (there's an) entire movement built on anger and hatred towards people different than you, it justifies and ultimately leads to violence against them."" Rubio offered a direct message to Trump: ""Mr. President, you can't allow #WhiteSupremacists to share only part of blame... (they) will see being assigned only 50% of blame as a win. We can not allow this old evil to be resurrected."" More: Trump distances himself from strategist Steve Bannon in wake of Charlottesville violence The president was slated to only discuss infrastructure during his appearances, but took questions from reporters for more than 15 minutes, most of them about Charlottesville. Some aides looked dismayed as he answered more questions. During a rollicking, impromptu news conference in which Trump and reporters frequently argued and interrupted each other, the president also: Questioned moves by local government to remove Confederate statues and monuments from public places Trump openly wondered whether tributes to George Washington and Thomas Jefferson are at risk because they were slave owners. ""You really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?"" Trump said. On the other hand, Trump said local governments are free to make their own decisions on these issues.

The President stated that he believed both protesters and counter protesters were to blame for the violence that erupted over the weekend.

""I think there's blame on both sides,"" President Trump said. ""You had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. And nobody wants to say that, but I'll say it.""

The President's comments come in the wake of a white nationalist rally that took place in Charlottesville on Saturday, which was met with counter protests from activists and community members. The event turned violent, resulting in the death of one person and injuring many others.

President Trump's stance on the issue has been met with criticism from both sides of the aisle, with many arguing that he has failed to adequately condemn the white supremacist groups involved in the violence. Others have praised the President's willingness to address what they see as a growing problem of left-wing violence.

The President's advisors have been quick to defend his comments, arguing that he was simply stating the facts as he saw them. ""The President is not afraid to speak the truth, even if it's not popular,"" said one advisor. ""He believes that both sides need to take responsibility for their actions, and that's what he was trying to convey.""

Despite the backlash, President Trump appears to be standing by his comments. ""I don't think there's anything wrong with what I said,"" he told reporters. ""I think it's important to get to the bottom of what happened in Charlottesville, and to make sure that something like this never happens again.""

The events in Charlottesville have sparked a national conversation about race, hate speech, and the role of law enforcement in maintaining public safety. As the country continues to grapple with these issues, it remains to be seen how President Trump's comments will impact the national dialogue.",open_ended_generation

After deciding that she just can’t let go of this hunk, Mariah reportedly decided to make it happen – an engagement, that is! “Word is Mariah took matters into her own hands,” a source tells OK! magazine, “It was an unusual proposal but it did the trick. She wrote a song about how she wanted Bryan to be her husband and she performed it for him while wearing a sexy, glitzy gown. Then she explained that she’s ready for them to make their relationship official.”  Bryan gave a “hearty yes,” as the insider says, “He couldn’t believe his luck!” It appears Bryan also thinks he and Mariah belong together, and he always wants to be her baby. These two aren’t waiting around for one sweet day to tie the knot. While love takes time, Mariah and Bryan are already busy making wedding plans. “Mariah would love to get married in May at the Grand Wailea Resort in Maui,” the insider told OK!, “where she and Bryan first went public with their romance.” Mariah and Bryan struck up a relationship in late 2016, with Mariah low-key confirming the romance in February 2017 by calling Bryan her “boyfriend.”  Mariah’s “also toying with the idea of a winter wonderland wedding,” the source says. “After all, she is the queen of Christmas!” Could Mariah have the fantasy holiday wedding she’s always wanted, saying “Thank God I found you” to her honey, her all? Whenever Mariah decides to get married, don’t forget about us when it comes to the wedding invitations!  This alleged engagement would be the third time Mariah walked down the aisle, as she was previously married to Tommy Mottola, 68, and Nick Cannon, 37. After dealing with a pair of heartbreakers, MiMi isn’t fooling around, especially when it comes to her $520 million fortune. She’s working on an ironclad prenup, according to OK! magazine. “She’s had tow failed marriages already,” the source says. “She’s not going to take any risks here.” Speaking of Nick, expect to see him during Mariah’s big day.  Nick and Mariah’s twins – son Morocco and daughter Monroe, 6 – will be featured in his wedding, and sources say Mariah’s thinking of asking Nick to walk her down the aisle. “[He] will always be a big part of her life,” the source added. Considering Mariah, Nick and the twins recently made an adorable appearance at the 2018 Kids’ Choice Awards, it makes total sense that Mariah’s ex would be on hand to see her say “I Do” again.","You are a journalist.

The audience was in stitches as Colbert posed the question to Jackman, who was visibly amused by the inquiry. The actor, known for his chiseled physique and impressive weightlifting abilities, has long been the subject of speculation regarding his body transformation for his role as Wolverine.

“I have to say, Stephen, I’m a little disappointed in you,” Jackman replied with a grin. “I thought you were a man of culture, a man of refinement. But to ask me that question, right out of the gate... I’m not sure I can take it.”

Colbert, undeterred, pressed on, asking Jackman if he had considered using his newfound freedom from the X-Men franchise to let his hair down, so to speak, and embrace a fuller figure.

“Look, I’m not going to lie, Stephen,” Jackman said, his smile still in place. “I’ve been working on my physique for a long time. It’s not easy to just let it all go and become ‘fat Jackman’ overnight. But I have been enjoying some extra pizza slices and beers since wrapping up Logan, I’ll tell you that much.”

The audience erupted in applause at Jackman’s response, and Colbert couldn’t help but join in on the fun, joking that he’d be happy to provide Jackman with some of his own weightlifting tips.

Despite the lighthearted nature of the exchange, it’s clear that Jackman is still in top physical form, and fans of the actor need not worry about him abandoning his fitness routine anytime soon. But who knows? Perhaps in the future, we’ll see a different side of Jackman – one that’s a little softer around the edges. Only time will tell.",open_ended_generation

The two actors were seen laughing and chatting together between takes, and at one point, they were even seen with their arms around each other.

This has led many to speculate that there may be a romantic connection between the two stars. However, it is worth noting that they have not yet confirmed their relationship status, and it is possible that they are just close friends.

Despite the lack of confirmation, fans of the actors have taken to social media to express their excitement about the possible romance. Many have pointed out that the two would make a great couple, given their shared sense of humor and their dedication to their craft.

For now, it remains to be seen whether there is any truth to the dating rumors.

Gossip Cop can exclusively bust this claim. We’re told it “never happened.”  © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  According to Life & Style, Maguire recently spotted the La La Land star at the swanky Hollywood hotel. A so-called “source” tells the magazine, “He was checking her out a lot, hoping she’d notice him.” The outlet’s dubious insider goes on to say that the actor eventually approached her, and began “showering her with cheesy compliments, telling her how all of Hollywood was in love with her.”  The magazine’s “source” then purports that Stone “didn’t seem interested in him,” but she “finally gave him her number and suggested meeting up for coffee, then ran off.” The supposed insider adds, “It was pretty obvious she was blowing him off.”  Gossip Cop, however, checked in with a reliable source close to the actor, who exclusively tells us the tabloid’s entire account of events is made-up and simply “never happened.” Unfortunately, we’re not surprised that Life & Style published this completely fictitious story. Gossip Cop previously busted the outlet for falsely alleging Eva Mendes was jealous of Stone’s friendship with Ryan Gosling. There was no truth to that claim, and the same goes for this latest one.","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news. The writing style should be serious and convincing.

The 'sentence' is: ","Tobey Maguire did NOT pursue Emma Stone and get her phone number at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, despite a made-up tabloid report.","Tobey Maguire has denied reports that he pursued Emma Stone and obtained her phone number at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles. According to a spokesperson for the actor, the story, which was published in a popular tabloid, is completely fabricated and has no basis in reality.

""Tobey has never even met Emma Stone, let alone pursued her or gotten her phone number,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. ""He thinks she's a talented actress, but they have never had any interaction whatsoever.""

The tabloid report in question claimed that Maguire and Stone had a chance encounter at the Chateau Marmont, where they were both attending separate events. According to the report, Maguire was immediately smitten with Stone and made a point to introduce himself and strike up a conversation. The report even went so far as to suggest that Maguire had managed to get Stone's phone number and was planning to ask her out on a date.

However, sources close to both Maguire and Stone have confirmed that the story is entirely made up. ""Tobey has been busy filming his latest movie and hasn't had time to even attend any events, let alone pursue a romance with Emma Stone,"" one source said. ""This is just another example of the tabloids printing false information in order to sell copies.""

In conclusion, it appears that this story is just another case of a tabloid spreading false information in order to generate buzz. Fans of Tobey Maguire and Emma Stone can rest assured that there is no truth to the report, and that both actors are focused on their respective careers.",open_ended_generation

“I wanted to create something fun that people could enjoy and also help a good cause,” Carey said in a statement. “Mental health is something that affects so many people, and it’s important to me to use my platform to make a positive impact.”

The T-shirts, which feature a playful design inspired by Carey’s iconic song “Vision of Love,” are available now on the singer’s website. Fans can choose from a variety of colors and styles, with prices starting at $25.

Carey’s foray into fashion is just the latest in a string of high-profile collaborations and projects for the singer, who has been killing the game since her Glitter days. She recently teamed up with DJ Khaled for a new single, “Til the Sun Goes Down,” and is set to perform at a number of music festivals this summer.

“Mental health is something that affects so many people, and it’s important to me to use my platform to make a positive impact,” Carey said. “I hope that by sharing my own experiences, I can help others feel more comfortable opening up about their struggles and seeking help.”

With her new T-shirt line, Carey is not only raising funds for mental health organizations, but also spreading a message of hope and support to those who need it most. As the singer herself once said, “I don’t want to be a princess. I just want to be a person who helps people.”

The former Real Housewife of New York, ran around the grounds in an A-line Carolina Herrera dress, posing on the step-and-repeat, taking photos with fans, and catching up with old friends. Trying to track her down for an interview turned into a scavenger hunt.  Scattered around the lawn were tables for vendors selling everything from wine to sex toys. There was a station for guests to get a vitamin infusion, with seats in the direct line of the sun transforming the spot into an inescapable sauna-I.V. drip hybrid. Housewives from across the country flew into town for the occasion (Vicki Gunvalson of Orange County and LeeAnne Locken of Dallas), which also served as a benefit for Thyroid Cancer Research in honor of Zarin’s late husband, Bobby, who died of the disease in January.  Upon first try to flag Zarin down for a couple of questions, she sent over her daughter, Ally Shapiro, in her stead. Shapiro reflected on last year’s luncheon, when her stepfather was still struggling with cancer, but encouraged her and her mother to party on.  “He loved drinking and partying. This was the highlight of his year,” she said. “It was this time last year that we were told he wasn’t gonna make it another week, and he pushed us and he said, ‘Go to the party. Maybe I won’t be here when you come back, but go.’”  Shapiro, who now lives in London while she works on her master’s degree, admits that she can’t watch old episodes of Real Housewives, which showed her as 14-year-old struggling to get close to her stepfather. “You want to think that it’s like a home movie, but it’s not. That’s not what our relationship was like,” she said, adding that the reruns play constantly in the U.K. “I’m walking down the street and someone’s like, ‘Oh my God, I just saw you trying on a prom dress!’”  She also said that her mother is dabbling with dating, specifically with a man she plays tennis with. “It’s fun, and I live in London so it’s good for her to have a distraction.”  Dina Lohan, dressed in a metallic green blazer and shorts set and a pair of oversized aviators, arrived fashionably late to the affair, but was immediately greeted by hoards of people trying to chat her up or get a photo. Eventually secured in the same spot for more than a few seconds, she was willing to talk about her daughter Lindsay’s upcoming project for MTV, a Vanderpump Rules–inspired reality show that follows Lindsay and the employees of her new Lohan Beach Club. Bunim/Murray Productions is producing the series, the same company that produced Lohan’s E! reality show Living Lohan a decade ago.  “These kids were like, babies, and now they’re running the show,” she said of the crew. “They lived in my house! And now they’re all corporate. . . . We’re home. It’s cyclical, you know.”  Lohan also revealed that the upcoming series is a bit of a family affair with Lindsay’s younger sister, 24-year-old Ali, providing the theme song.  A friend of Lohan’s interjected, asking if Ali, like her older sister over a decade ago, had moved out to L.A. for work.  “She’s in New York with me,” the matriarch answered. “I keep them close! I’m not going to lose someone to L.A., no. Not again!”  Finally, the woman of the hour managed to stop and take a breath. While Zarin may no longer be a Bravo housewife, she still knows how to schmooze like one.

Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward saying he confided in them that he was unsure of the paternity of the now-27-year-old.  Jan Ashley, who married the businessman after Khloe's mother Kris Jenner, said: 'Khloe is not his kid -- he told me that after we got married.'  And Ellen Pierson, 63, who married Robert in 2003 just two months before his death, has also come forward after eight years of silence to 'tell the truth' about the Kardashian family.  Claims: Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward claiming the lawyer told them Khloe Kardashian, left, was not his real daughter, like older sisters Kim and Kourtney  The reality star has hit back at the claims, calling them 'really low'.  In an explosive interview with Star magazine, Ashley said: 'He just kind of looked at me and said [it] like it was a matter of fact. He said ""Well, you know that Khloe's not really a Kardashian, don't you?""    'And I said… ""OK"" and that was it.'

She looked nothing like the rest. She was tall, had a different shape, light hair, curly hair. Didn't look anything like the other three children.'  Different: Khloe has often pointed out that she looks nothing like her older sisters and their mother Kris, far right, said once people asked whether she was 'the milkman's child'  Fighting back: Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter She said Robert, who is of Armenian descent, had told her that he and Kris were not sleeping together at the time Khloe was conceived. '[But] he never would have considered a DNA test. He loved her very much. Robert did question the fact that Khloe was his,' Ellen said. 'Any normal man would if they knew their wife had cheated on him.' Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter.  Daddy's little girl: Robert Kardashian, pictured with Khloe as a child, referred to having four biological children in court documents filed in 1999 She wrote: 'The audacity you have to mention my father’s name like this!

A new study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health has revealed a startling trend: teenage vaping rates have increased significantly over the past year. According to the study, which surveyed over 1,000 high school students across the country, nearly 40% of teens have tried vaping at least once, with over 20% reporting regular use.

This is a sharp increase from previous years, with a 2017 survey finding that only 12% of high school students had tried vaping. The study's authors attribute the rise in vaping rates to a number of factors, including the ease of access to vaping products, the perceived safety of vaping compared to smoking traditional cigarettes, and the popularity of vaping among peer groups.

The study's lead author, Dr. Karen Wilson, expressed concern about the findings, stating, ""We are seeing a generation of young people who are becoming hooked on nicotine, and it's a major public health issue. Vaping may be less harmful than smoking, but it's still a dangerous habit that can have serious health consequences, including addiction, respiratory problems, and increased risk of heart disease.""

The study's findings come as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has announced plans to crack down on the sale of vaping products to minors. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has stated that the agency will take action against retailers who sell vaping products to minors and will also pursue legal action against manufacturers who market their products in a way that appeals to young people.

The rise in teenage vaping rates has also sparked calls for increased education and awareness about the dangers of vaping. Many health experts argue that young people are not aware of the risks associated with vaping and that more needs to be done to educate them about the potential health consequences.

In response to the study's findings, several health organizations have launched campaigns to raise awareness about the dangers of vaping and to encourage young people to avoid the habit. The American Lung Association, for example, has launched a program called ""In the Clear,"" which provides resources and support for young people who want to quit vaping.

The study's findings have also sparked renewed calls for stricter regulations on the vaping industry. Many health experts argue that the industry has been able to operate largely unchecked, with few restrictions on the sale and marketing of vaping products.

In conclusion, the alarming rise in teenage vaping rates is a serious public health issue that demands immediate attention and action. While vaping may be less harmful than smoking, it is still a dangerous habit that can have serious health consequences, and young people need to be aware of the risks. Stricter regulations, increased education and awareness, and enforcement of existing laws are all necessary steps to address this issue and protect the health of our young people.",open_ended_generation
gossipcop-5865271192,1,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.

According to sources close to the former ""Dawson's Creek"" actress, she has been facing a series of challenges in her relationships with her boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise, and daughter Suri.

Despite efforts to keep her personal life private, rumors have been swirling about the nature of Holmes' relationships with the men in her life. Some reports have suggested that there may be tension between Holmes and Foxx, with some insiders claiming that the couple has been experiencing difficulties in their relationship.

Meanwhile, there have been whispers of a possible reconciliation between Holmes and her ex-husband, Tom Cruise. The former couple, who were married for five years before divorcing in 2012, have been spotted together on several occasions in recent months, leading some to speculate that they may be rekindling their romance.

However, it is Holmes' relationship with her daughter Suri that has been the subject of the most concern. According to sources, the actress has been struggling to balance her work and family life, with some insiders claiming that she has been feeling overwhelmed and stressed as a result.

Despite these challenges, Holmes has remained tight-lipped about her personal life, refusing to comment on the various rumors and speculation surrounding her relationships. It is clear that the actress is determined to keep her private life private, and it is to be admired that she has managed to maintain such a level of discretion in the face of intense media scrutiny.

As the media frenzy surrounding Holmes' personal life continues to swirl, it is important to remember that there are real people involved in these stories, with feelings and emotions that should be respected.

For the novel, see Thirteen Reasons Why 13 Reasons Why (stylized onscreen as TH1RTEEN R3ASONS WHY) is an American teen drama web television series developed for Netflix by Brian Yorkey, based on the 2007 novel Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher. The series revolves around seventeen year old high school student, Clay Jensen, and his deceased female friend Hannah Baker, who has committed suicide after failing to cope with the culture, gossip and lack of support from her friends and her school. A box of cassette tapes recorded by Hannah in the lead up to her suicide detail thirteen reasons why she ended her life. The series is produced by July Moon Productions, Kicked to the Curb Productions, Anonymous Content and Paramount Television, with Yorkey and Diana Son serving as showrunners. Dylan Minnette stars as Clay, while Katherine Langford plays Hannah. Christian Navarro, Alisha Boe, Brandon Flynn, Justin Prentice, Miles Heizer, Ross Butler, Devin Druid, Amy Hargreaves, Derek Luke, Kate Walsh, and Brian d'Arcy James also star. A film from Universal Pictures based on Thirteen Reasons Why began development in February 2011, with Selena Gomez set to star as Hannah, before being shelved in favor of a television series and Netflix ordering the show straight to series in October 2015, with Gomez instead serving as an executive producer. The first season was released on Netflix on March 31, 2017. It received positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised its subject matter and acting, particularly the performances of Minnette and Langford. For her performance, Langford received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Drama Series. However, its graphic depiction of issues such as suicide and rape, along with other mature content prompted concerns from mental health professionals. In response, Netflix added a warning card and from March 2018, a video that plays at the start of each season warning viewers about its themes.[2] In May 2017, Netflix renewed 13 Reasons Why for a second season; filming began the next month and concluded that December. The second season was released on May 18, 2018, and received negative reviews from critics and mixed reviews from audiences. A third season was ordered in June 2018 and is set to be released in 2019. Critical and audience reaction to the series has been divided, with the program generating controversy between audiences and industry reviewers. Premise [ edit ] In season one, seventeen year old Clay Jensen returns home from school one day to find a mysterious box on his porch. Inside he discovers seven cassette tapes recorded by Hannah Baker, his deceased classmate and unrequited love, who committed suicide two weeks earlier. On the tapes, Hannah unfolds an intensely emotional audio diary, detailing why she decided to end her life. It appears each person who receives this package of old-style tapes is fundamentally related to why she killed herself. Clay is not the first to receive the tapes, but there is implied detail as to how he should pass the tapes on after hearing them. There appears to be an order to distribution of the tapes, with an additional copy held by an overseer should the plan go awry. Each tape recording refers to a different person involved in Hannah's life contributing to a reason for her suicide. The tapes refer to both friends and enemies. In season two, months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and the other people mentioned on the tapes, as well as close friends and Hannah's family members, become embroiled in a civil legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Alleging negligence on the part of the school, Hannah's mother pursues her perception of justice, while her reluctance to settle pre-trial and her personal circumstances eventually break up her marriage with Hannah's father. The story unfolds with narratives illustrating Hannah's story told by those who present in court at trial. Clay, who perceives himself as Hannah's failed protector, embarks on an investigation using whatever evidence he can find in an effort to impact on the civil case between Hannah's parents and the school. Clay also endeavours to expose the corrupted culture of the High School and its favour of wealthy, sports savvy male students over the average student, which especially compromises the integrity of young girls such as Hannah. Throughout season two, Clay appears to be communicating with the ghost of Hannah as a plot narrative device. Cast and characters [ edit ] Main [ edit ] Recurring [ edit ] Introduced in season one [ edit ] Josh Hamilton as Matt Jensen, Clay's father, a psychologist. Michele Selene Ang as Courtney Crimsen, a closeted student at Liberty High who is responsible for spreading rumors about Hannah to protect the secret of her own sexual orientation.

Steven Silver as Marcus Cole, the self-centered student body president at Liberty High, who is responsible for humiliating and attempting to sexually assault Hannah on a date.

According to our source, it’s only a matter of time before Selena responds to Charlie’s bombshell admission that they were briefly an item — and that Justin Bieber, 23, may have caused the two to go their separate ways. “Now, she will definitely have to respond down the line, and it’s just frustrating when people add their dirty laundry to a situation,” our source added. “She’s learned from the first time dating Justin and The Weeknd that less is more, which explains her relationship with Justin now being much more under the radar.” We reported earlier how Selena and Justin put to rest rumors that they had split by reuniting at one of his hockey games. While they arrived separately, the two of them definitely left together.  Time will tell if Charlie’s big reveal will throw a wedge into Jelena’s relationship, but all signs point to the two of them continuing to make it work in 2018.

Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Yet — Kylie Jenner, 20, has not actually confirmed she is pregnant.  For some celebrities, this would not be a big deal — some stars get pregnant and do not say a word, even as “sources” and “insiders” dish to the tabloids, as illustrated above. For someone in the Kardashian-Jenner family, this is especially confusing.  After all, these family members have become international superstars because they share nearly every detail of their lives, even the painful or uncomfortable moments. As a result, people have become inexplicably fascinated by all of them (Kris Jenner, Caitlyn Jenner, Kim Kardashian West, Kourtney Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Rob Kardashian), which has fueled their multimillion-dollar franchise of reality shows and sponsorships.  So the decision to keep Kylie’s apparent pregnancy under wraps is very off-brand for the family. This month, speculation will probably hit even more of a fever pitch, as February is the oft-reported due date for her baby, reportedly a girl.  The non-confirmation of the news — reported by the tabloids in September and described as a “happy” surprise for Kylie and her boyfriend, rapper Travis Scott — has sent some fans into a spiral. On Christmas Day, fans melted down when Kylie did not appear on the family’s annual Christmas card. Starting Dec. 1, Kim released a new part of the photo every day, and many expected Kylie’s announcement to be included in the final photo shoot. No dice.  [Kylie Jenner still hasn’t confirmed her pregnancy. On Christmas, fans melted down on social media.]  Meanwhile, people keep searching for information. TMZ posted blurry footage of Kylie’s first public appearance since the fall, although she’s wearing baggy clothes.

Magazine is reporting that the ""Wildest Dreams"" singer has been contacting her ex ever since he has been in New York City starring in the Broadway show called Sunday in the Park With George.  The tabloid is reporting that a source is saying that Taylor is the one reaching out to the actor since she feels she is now more mature than she was when they dated back in 2010.  The source said, “Taylor was so young when they dated, she wasn’t ready for a serious relationship, but now she’s showing Jake how much she’s matured. She’s excited to see where things go.”  In 2015, a rumor swirled around saying that the stars were in contact with each other, even though she was dating Calvin Harris at the time.  An unidentified source told Star magazine that, “He said he owed Taylor an apology for how things ended between them. In June, Jake ran into Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show and asked for Taylor’s new number. They’ve kept in touch, albeit secretly, ever since.""  This would all be so ironic since Taylor allegedly wrote the hit song ""We Are Never Getting Back Together"" from her Red album about the relationship after her ex's friend asked her if they were giving their relationship a second chance.  “This guy walks in who is a friend of my ex’s and starts talking about how he’s heard we’re going to get back together. And that was not the case. So I start telling them the story: break up, get back together, break-up, get back together — just, ugh, the worst! And I picked up the guitar and (songwriting partner Max Martin) said, ‘This is what we’re writing,’” she once revealed to GMA.  The lyrics in the track said: ""I'm really gonna miss you picking fights / And me falling for it screaming that I'm right / And you would hide away and find your peace of mind / With some indie record that's much cooler than mine.""  In the video for the song, the actor who plays the singer's love interest gives her a scarf which many thought to be a clue that revealed the song was about Jake since she had been photographed wearing one of his scarfs while they were dating.  Since Taylor is now single and so is Jake and they both happen to be living in the same city, we don't see how this could be a problem. There is no confirmation that this is actually happening though and a source close to them told Gossip Cop that there was ""no truth"" to the report.

The wedding will allegedly take place on a wildlife reserve, wear traditional Cambodian clothing, and serve local delicacies at the reception. “Angie’s thinking of having Shiloh, Zahara, and Vivienne as bridesmaids and Maddox as the groom’s best man since Maddox sort of feels he’s the man of the family now,” the source said.

On last Sunday’s BET awards, it was quite clear that Jay-Z and Beyonce were not buddy, buddy with Kim Kardashian. In fact, the camera caught Jay barely acknowledge Kim when he was going on stage to accept his award with Kanye West. Since Jay and Kanye are not only music collaborators but close friends, will “Kimye” stand a chance?  Unfortunately, Kim cannot make Kanye’s friends like her. It will be Kanye’s responsibility to lay the law down with his buddies. He must let it be known that high school bully behavior toward his girlfriend is unacceptable.  If his friends continue to snub her, then the rap star will have to distance himself from his friends until they realize he and Kim are a package deal.  Although Jay-Z and Beyonce have preconceived notions of what Kim and the Kardashians are all about, they do not actually know who Kim is.  If they take off their judgmental glasses, they may even come to like her or at least tolerate her in their group.  Remember, if a friend is happy with their new significant other, don’t hate.

The 'sentence' is: ","Can Kimye last long-term if Kanye’s besties, Jay-Z and Beyonce, keep giving her the cold shoulder? Or can friends “kill” a love affair?","For Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, time is of the essence. The power couple, fondly known as Kimye, has been making waves in the entertainment industry since they started dating in 2012. But despite their seemingly strong bond, rumors of a rift between Kim and Kanye's best friends, Jay-Z and Beyonce, have been circulating for months. The question on everyone's mind is: can Kimye last long-term if Kanye's besties keep giving her the cold shoulder? Or can friends ""kill"" a love affair? 

Sources close to the couple have revealed that tensions between Kim and Jay-Z and Beyonce have been running high for quite some time. According to insiders, Jay-Z and Beyonce have never been fans of Kim's reality TV show, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and have expressed their disdain for the way the Kardashian clan has handled their fame. This has reportedly led to a series of heated arguments between the four, with Kanye often finding himself caught in the middle. 

Furthermore, rumors have been swirling that Jay-Z and Beyonce have been actively trying to distance themselves from Kimye, with Beyonce even going so far as to unfollow Kim on Instagram. This has led many to speculate that the Carters are intentionally trying to sabotage Kimye's relationship. 

However, it's worth noting that neither Kimye nor the Carters have publicly confirmed these rumors. In fact, Kanye has been vocal about his admiration for Jay-Z and Beyonce, calling them ""family"" in a recent interview. And despite the rumored tensions, Kim and Kanye have continued to make public appearances together, looking happier than ever. 

So, can Kimye last long-term if Kanye's best friends keep giving her the cold shoulder? It's hard to say for sure. But what is clear is that the fate of their relationship may very well depend on the ability of all parties involved to put their differences aside and work towards a resolution. As of now, it's a waiting game to see whether Kimye can weather the storm or whether their love affair will ultimately be ""killed"" by the chill between Kim and Jay-Z and Beyonce. One thing's for certain, though: the world will be watching with bated breath to see how it all plays out.",open_ended_generation

It wasn’t so bad on the scale of celebrity breakups, but after less than three years of marriage (a lifetime in Hollywood), it was a tabloid downer for a day or two.  In case there are still people busying themselves wondering if Aniston is happy (just a note, she really doesn’t want you to), please stop. According to the latest tabloid reports, she’s doing just fine. She’s reportedly back on the dating scene with two different beaus, per Us Weekly, and her friends are having trouble not talking about it. One man is reportedly a bachelor who recently split from his wife and the other is an “industry creative,” whatever that ever means. Neither of them is an actor.  But there’s no reason to believe we’ll learn more anytime soon. In July of 2016, Aniston wrote a pretty searing op-ed for HuffPost in which she scolded paparazzi that are constantly obsessed with whether she’s in love or having babies.  “For the record, I am not pregnant,” she wrote then. “What I am is fed up. I’m fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body-shaming that occurs daily under the guise of ‘journalism,’ the ‘First Amendment,’ and ‘celebrity news.’”  O.K., so, Jennifer Aniston is happy.

(Through a lawyer, Kelly denied all accusations, saying he would “work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.”) And in April, another woman accused Kelly of “knowingly and intentionally infecting her with an STD.” Her lawyers say they are currently preparing a federal civil lawsuit. Through a spokesperson, Kelly issued a statement to the Washington Post in which he “categorically denies all claims and allegations.” As man after man has fallen to the #MeToo reckoning, losing jobs and retiring from public life after being accused of sexual harassment and assault, there’s been a recurring whisper: What about R. Kelly? Despite decades of lawsuits and allegations, Kelly’s career has marched steadily on. Last year, he finished an arena tour with a few cancellations. This year, he’s touring with singer Charlie Wilson (some protests are planned). His music appeared in Pitch Perfect 3. At this year’s Coachella, rapper Vince Staples repeatedly referred to Kelly as a “child molester” in an interview with Complex, insisting, “He pees on people.” In our post-#MeToo, post-Time’s Up, post-Harvey Weinstein world, and given the sheer volume of allegations against Kelly, it seems reasonable to raise the question of why he continues to work as much as he does. But Staples’s interviewer only giggled nervously and protested, “We can’t ever talk about this guy. ... You’re about to get me fired from Coachella. It’s my first time here.” Later, Staples tweeted that “R. Kelly people is looking for me.” ladies and gentlemen, vince staples on r kelly pic.twitter.com/SmZdYu9PNJ — andy (@aboynamedandy) April 16, 2018 That stasis may be starting to change. Most of the claims against Kelly were reiterated in a recent BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes. And over the past year, at least five members of Kelly’s inner circle have left him. His assistant, his accountant, his lawyer, and his rep have all said that they no longer work for him, although none of them have gone into detail about their departures and all have been supportive and complimentary toward Kelly in their statements. His longtime musical accompanist, DJ Phantom, was less circumspect about his decision to leave Kelly in December: “I didn’t know then what I know now,” he said. “He’s a shitbag.” In April, the Women of Color committee within Time’s Up threw its weight behind the #MuteRKelly campaign, calling for anyone currently profiting from Kelly and his music to drop him, including Spotify, Ticketmaster, and Kelly’s record label, RCA. Shortly thereafter, Spotify announced that it would no longer be promoting Kelly’s music, although his music would remain in their streaming catalog. It’s possible that these new developlments mean things are changing for Kelly, and that he’s about to face lasting consequences for those accusations. But if that’s the case, those consequences took more than two decades to reach him. There is a persistent vagueness to the way we talk about R. Kelly that makes it possible to forget exactly what he’s been accused of, how often he’s been accused, and how much proof there is against him. And most likely, that’s because his alleged victims are overwhelmingly young black women and hence apparently easy for America to ignore. “The saddest fact I’ve learned is: Nobody matters less to our society than young black women,” says Jim DeRogatis, the reporter who broke the R. Kelly story. “Nobody.” To try to combat that vagueness and the erasure that it makes possible, here is a timeline of all of the accusations of sexual misconduct against R. Kelly. Much of the chronology here is drawn from DeRogatis’s invaluable coverage of the R. Kelly accusations, including his own immensely thorough timeline. DeRogatis’s timeline covers the entire span of Kelly’s life, including his major career milestones and unrelated legal issues, but I’ve narrowed the focus of this timeline to specifically the sexual misconduct accusations against Kelly. Over the 24-year span of this timeline, a consistent pattern emerges. Over and over again, Kelly is accused of the same behavior: of targeting girls and very young women, isolating them, and controlling and abusing them. And after the dust from the accusation settles, Kelly goes on living his life with very few changes. Here, from Aaliyah to the alleged sex cult, are all the R. Kelly accusations. August 30, 1994: 27-year-old R. Kelly marries 15-year-old Aaliyah The ’90s music sensation Aaliyah was Kelly’s protégé. They met when she was 12 years old, and Kelly wrote and produced her first album in 1993. It was titled Age Ain’t Nothing but a Number. In 1995, Vibe magazine published a copy of their marriage license, with 15-year-old Aaliyah falsely listing her age as 18. “Family members say Aaliyah thought it was all an elaborate ‘game,’ and she just went along with it,” the Chicago Sun-Times later reported, adding that the marriage license was reportedly obtained by Kelly’s assistant, using a fake ID. “Within hours, she realized what had happened, and she went to her family and sought their help.” The marriage was annulled in 1994, just months after the ceremony. In the settlement, according to documents obtained by the Sun-Times, Aaliyah promises not to pursue further legal action because of “emotional distress caused","You are a journalist.

Kelly has been accused of sexual relationships with minors going back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah.","R. Kelly’s time may have finally come.

For years, the renowned R&B singer has been dogged by allegations of sexual relationships with minors. The most high-profile of these accusations dates back to 1994, when Kelly married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah. Despite the mounting evidence against him, Kelly has consistently denied any wrongdoing and has managed to avoid criminal charges.

However, it appears that Kelly's luck may have run out. According to sources close to the investigation, the singer is currently under investigation by the FBI for allegations of sexual misconduct with minors. The investigation is said to be focusing on several instances of alleged sexual abuse, including an alleged encounter between Kelly and a 16-year-old girl in 2015.

The news comes on the heels of a bombshell report by BuzzFeed News, which revealed that Kelly had been accused of holding women against their will in a ""cult""-like environment. The report sparked widespread outrage and calls for Kelly's music to be boycotted.

Kelly's legal team has yet to comment on the latest allegations, but the singer has previously denied all accusations of wrongdoing. Despite this, the mounting evidence against him has led many to speculate that his time in the music industry may be coming to an end.

As the investigation into Kelly's conduct continues, fans and critics alike are left to wonder if the singer's career will survive the fallout. One thing is certain: R. Kelly's time may have finally come, and it's long overdue.",open_ended_generation

Here’s how the Biebs is coping with his time apart from Sel.  Justin Bieber, 24, is going through a tough time as his relationship with Selena Gomez, 25, is on pause. She’s currently on vacation with friends in Sydney, Australia, where she appears to be carefree in this new video. However, a source reveals that the same can’t be said for Bieber. “Justin has Selena on the brain constantly. He is trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time but he keeps thinking about her,” a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “He always wants to be around her, talk to her and be with her. She is like a drug for him, he just needs more and more and more.”  As the Biebs continues to struggle with their time apart, he’s got a few things up his sleeve for when she returns to LA. “He can’t wait until she is back because he wants to really wine and dine her upon her return and really kick start the relationship back up again,” the insider reveals. It’s unclear when Sel is scheduled to return to the West Coast. But, as seen on her Instagram, she is having the time of her life. She posted a video which showed her laughing on a boat, accompanied by a subliminal message, that she “chose” to take care of herself, “not to prove anything to anyone.” Was she trying to give us insight into her most recent split with Bieber?  Jelena fans went into panic mode after seeing Sel in the arms of another man on a boat on March 19. She was photographed hugging and goofing off in photos with Sydney native, Johnny Rays. While all signs point to a friendship between the two, the photos didn’t appear that way to some fans who claimed they looked too close for comfort.  While Sel has been vacationing Down Under, Bieber has been staying active. He’s been photographed playing hockey and soccer with friends. However, his emotions may be getting the best of him as he took a gnarly fall during a soccer game on March 19, and seemingly broke down on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.  As you may recall, Jelena reunited in October 2017, after her split with The Weeknd, 28. They seemed inseparable, having spent New Year’s together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, their romance took a rocky turn around Bieber’s birthday on March 1, according to reports.","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news.

The study, which was conducted by a team of researchers at a leading university, analyzed the financial data of numerous celebrities and found a direct correlation between fame and wealth.

The study's lead author, Dr. Jane Smith, said in a statement, ""We were surprised to find that the relationship between fame and wealth was so clear-cut. It seems that the more famous an individual is, the more money they are able to generate.""

The study also found that this relationship holds true for women who have become famous through their association with the reality TV show ""The Real Housewives.""

gossipcop-28284230,1,"Not so fast! Madonna was hit with a series of “uncomfortable questions” by a judge before she was granted permission to adopt her 4-year-old twin girls from Malawi, the presiding judge said in court documents obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, February 8.  “The petitioner is a professional performer and I guarded myself against the danger of her merely reciting a well-rehearsed speech by asking her some rather uncomfortable questions to which she gave very candid answers,” Judge Fiona Mwale said in her ruling, explaining her reasons for approving the adoption.  After pressing Madonna, 58, to explain her intentions in adding two more little ones to her brood of four, Judge Mwale said she was satisfied that the girls would be in good hands with the Material Girl.  “There is no doubt that the petitioner can offer the infants not only the best education money can buy, but also guidance with a high likelihood of ensuring that the two infants grow to be self-sufficient adults,” Judge Mwale said, adding that she is satisfied that Madonna “is motivated by her desire to offer a home, love, protection and guidance to the infants.”  In the court documents, Judge Mwale addressed prior controversies surrounding Madonna’s adoptions in Malawi. “In determining her motives, I questioned the petitioner at length about the impact of her decision which could be construed as robbing Malawi of its most precious resource, its children,” the judge wrote.  As previously reported, Madonna filed for adoption in High Court in Malawi on January 25 but tried to keep the process under wraps until a final decision was made. (The Queen of Pop issued a statement denying her adoption to Us Weekly that same day, claiming that she was in Malawi “to check on the children’s hospital in Blantyre.”) According to the AP, she has already raised $7.5 million for a pediatric surgery ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, which is set to open early next year.  Madonna previously adopted son David and daughter Mercy James, both 11, from Malawi in 2008 and 2009, respectively. She is also mom to daughter Lourdes, 20, whom she shares with ex Carlos Leon, and son Rocco, 16, whom she shares with ex-husband Guy Ritchie.  Madonna’s twin girls will retain their birth names as a part of an effort to preserve their identity as Malawian nationals, the court documents said, and their father was at the January 25 court hearing with Madonna. (The twins’ mother died within a week of childbirth due to health complications.)  On Wednesday, February 8, Madonna took to social media to share the happy news. “I can officially confirm I have completed the process of adopting twin sisters from Malawi and am overjoyed that they are now part of our family,” she captioned an image of herself walking between the two little girls. “I am deeply grateful to all those in Malawi who helped make this possible, and I ask the media please to respect our privacy during this transitional time. 🙏🏻 Thank you also to my friends, family and my very large team for all your support and Love!”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

Madonna was hit with a series of “uncomfortable questions” by a judge before she was granted permission to adopt her 4-year-old twin girls from Malawi, the presiding judge said in court documents obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, February 8.

In a surprise turn of events, pop icon Madonna has been asked to answer a series of ""uncomfortable questions"" by a judge before being granted permission to adopt 4-year-old twin girls from Malawi. According to court documents obtained by The Associated Press, the presiding judge revealed that Madonna was not given a free pass in the adoption process, despite her celebrity status.

The court documents, which were obtained on Wednesday, February 8, indicate that Madonna was required to provide detailed information about her financial situation, her relationship with her current children, and her ability to provide a stable and loving home for the twin girls. The judge also asked Madonna about her musical tours and how they might impact her ability to care for the children.

The adoption process has been ongoing since 2016, when Madonna first expressed her interest in adopting the twin girls, named Esther and Stella. The singer has been a frequent visitor to Malawi, where she has been involved in various charity work and has adopted two other children from the country.

Despite the hurdles, Madonna's representatives have expressed confidence that the adoption will be finalized soon. ""We are grateful for the court's careful consideration and are confident that Madonna will be a wonderful mother to Esther and Stella,"" said a spokesperson for the singer.

The adoption news comes on the heels of Madonna's recent controversial comments about the Catholic Church and its stance on abortion. The singer has been an outspoken advocate for women's rights and has been criticized by some for her views. However, her representatives have made it clear that her adoption plans are unrelated to her religious beliefs.

The twin girls, Esther and Stella, have been living in an orphanage in Malawi since they were infants. They are said to be delightful and full of energy, and are eagerly awaiting their new life with Madonna.

The adoption process is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks, and Madonna is said to be thrilled at the prospect of welcoming the twin girls into her family. With this latest development, it seems that the Material Girl is about to become a mom once again.",open_ended_generation

He doesn’t want to hang out with him, or his other hard-partying friends like Tom Sturridge or Eddie Redmayne.”  But we haven’t heard anything negative about FKA Twigs since they started dating in 2014, so it sounds like having a low-profile and more mature partner is exactly what he needed to turn his life around!","You are a journalist.

The Times has learned that actor John Smith has been struggling with substance abuse during the filming of his latest movie. In an interview with The Times, Smith revealed that he had been “wasted the whole time” during the filming and had experienced a number of negative effects as a result.

According to Smith, he started speaking gibberish and was unable to remember his lines, leading the studio to cut his days and improvise his scenes. He likened his experience to having his brain hacked, saying that he felt insane and out of control.

This revelation comes as a surprise to fans of Smith, who has been known for his talent and dedication to his craft. It is unclear at this time whether Smith's struggles with substance abuse will have any impact on the release of the movie or his future career.

The Times reached out to the studio for comment, but they declined to provide any information at this time. It is worth noting that substance abuse is a serious issue that affects many people in the entertainment industry, and it is important for those struggling with addiction to seek help and support.

In light of this news, fans of Smith are expressing their support and concern for his well-being on social media. Many are calling for him to seek help and to take care of himself, and some are even sharing their own stories of struggle and recovery.

But from day one there was open communication with Ricky about what I had gone through. I think one of the reasons I fell in love so quickly is that I could say everything and know I was not being judged.”  Bischoff hasn’t spoken to Soules recently but says she wishes him well. “I hope that he meets someone, if he hasn’t already, just as great for him and Ricky is for me.”  Now, Bischoff still watches The Bachelor, but says she’s moved on from her own reality show past. “That journey was a big part of my life,” she says. “But since I’ve met Ricky, I really haven’t looked back.”  Busy with wedding plans (the couple are looking at a date next fall), Bischoff says she nonetheless has positive associations with the show. “It’s sad that it ended the way it had to end, but I was still looking for that perfect someone.

Despite the lack of confirmation, many tabloids have run with the story, using the photo as evidence that Aniston is indeed pregnant. Some have even gone so far as to speculate about the baby's due date and potential baby names.

It is worth noting that Aniston has been open about her struggles with fertility in the past. In 2018, she revealed that she had undergone several rounds of in vitro fertilization (IVF) in an effort to conceive. She has also spoken about the emotional toll that the process has taken on her.

While it is certainly possible that Aniston and Theroux are expecting a baby, it is also important to remember that pregnancy rumors can be harmful and invasive. It is crucial to respect the privacy of celebrities and to avoid spreading unconfirmed rumors.

Though her 1989 world tour boasted numerous sold out performances (it eventually became the highest grossing tour of 2015), it appears her considerably more expensive snake persona is a tougher sell.  Last month, her “longtime” tour promoter told Billboard, “By the time all the tickets are sold next week, I’ll be celebrating Taylor’s birthday with a cocktail in my hand and sold-out concerts all over the world.” But her birthday has come and gone, and not one date has sold out.  Reputation was the biggest-selling album of 2017 and the tour is shaping up to be far from ill-attended, so the Post’s headline, “Taylor Swift’s Reputation tour shaping up to be a disaster,” is a little much. It does, however, highlight the problems with unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and Ticketmaster in general.  The company’s “Verified Fan” program, which they would like you to believe is all about rewarding music lovers, appears to be nothing but a cash grab that takes advantage of Swift-obsessed teens with easy access to their parents’ credit card numbers. People willing to drop $50 on merch, the Post reports, could “improve [their] position in line to purchase tickets.” And, once accessible, the tickets are often too expensive for many fans.  “I paid $150 for my ticket with amazing seats for the 1989 tour,” one fan wrote. “Now for the same seats I have to pay about $500.”  Advertisement  In related news, tickets to Katy Perry’s Friday show in New Orleans are currently starting at $23.","You are a journalist.

Ticket prices for Taylor Swift's Reputation tour have reached astronomical heights, causing many fans to be priced out of attending the highly anticipated concerts. According to a recent report by the New York Post, the high demand for tickets has led to exorbitant prices, with some tickets selling for thousands of dollars.

Fans have taken to social media to express their disappointment and frustration over the sky-high prices. ""I've been a fan of Taylor Swift for years, but there's no way I can afford to go to her concert with prices like these,"" tweeted one fan. ""It's ridiculous that she's pricing out her own fans,"" added another.

The high prices have also led to a thriving secondary market, with tickets being resold for even higher prices. One ticket reseller was offering tickets for over $5,000, sparking outrage among fans who feel that the prices are unfair and exploitative.

The high ticket prices have also raised questions about the ethics of ticket scalping and the impact it has on fans. ""It's not right that people are profiting off of other people's passion and dedication,"" said one fan. ""Taylor Swift should do something to stop this.""

In response to the backlash, Taylor Swift's team has released a statement saying that they are working to make tickets more accessible to fans. ""We understand that ticket prices can be a barrier for some fans, and we are working to ensure that tickets are available to as many fans as possible,"" the statement read.

However, fans remain skeptical, with many calling for more transparency and action from the singer and her team. The controversy has sparked a larger conversation about the ticketing industry and the need for greater regulation and transparency.

I picked difficult situations the first two times, but I think you learn with each one. I’m a person that believes that if I’m wrong, that’s when I learn, and when I’m right, I haven’t learned a thing.”  Noting that he takes his relationship “day to day,” Brolin revealed that he’s an advocate of marriage counseling.  “I do believe in counseling if anybody ever has a problem in their marriage. Bring in a referee, talk it over, and I swear to you, it will dispel by the end of the session, each time!” he said. “Sometimes in a tough marriage, it’s tough to talk, but if you do, it works!”  The 77-year-old actor has also learned to maintain his marriage with Streisand by not interrupting her during hectic times.  “When she’s busy, she’s really focused, and part of our good relationship is that I understand that,” he shared. “And if I come to her with something important and she says, ‘I don’t have time right now,’ she doesn’t have time, period. That’s the way the mind works. You gotta focus.”  As for how Streisand, 75, makes him feel special, Brolin said, “I’m always welcome when I get home. I always get notes, ‘Hurry home!’ When I get there, there’s always something kind of great waiting for me, some plan, and I try to reciprocate.”  RELATED CONTENT:  Barbra Streisand Calls Out Golden Globes for Not Awarding More Female Directors  ‘Girls Trip' Star Tiffany Haddish Says She Taught Barbra Streisand All About Cardi B  Josh Brolin on His Ripped Bod and How He Knew Wife Kathyrn Boyd Was the One (Exclusive)  Related Gallery","You are a journalist.

Up till tpo that moment Crazy Jo-lie had kept Brad far from Jen. Make no mistake about it. Her frantic traveling all over the place was an attempt at keeping Pitt away from her and and any other person who might think they were a friend. She can't stand anyone but her having anything to do with Pitt . Including his own family. I knew it would backfire one day. Brad what took so long????? She suffers from an extreme mental illness. She doesn't have the kids in school for the same reason.  I do believe she thought it would last. Seeing how sexy and pretty she thinks she is. A man should and would do anything she tells them to.  I am under the impression her treatment of her surrogate Holly had a sort of wake up call to Pitt as to how utterly evil she is. You can bet she dismissed her like a piece of shite.

Eyewitnesses claim that Jen, who was a presenter at the prestigious event, was seen arguing with several industry heavyweights during the commercial breaks. Her behavior was described as ""erratic"" and ""unprofessional,"" with some onlookers suggesting that she may have had too much to drink.

Since the incident, Jen's publicist has been working overtime to mitigate the damage, releasing a statement apologizing for her behavior and blaming it on a ""wardrobe malfunction.""

There comes a time in every couple's relationship when the question of moving in together becomes impossible to ignore. And when those two lovebirds have been stepping out for 15 months — even though they live 3,500 miles apart; he in the UK, she in Canada — it's not so much a case of 'if' as of 'when' they will settle down. So it comes as no surprise that Prince Harry, 33, and his actress girlfriend Meghan Markle, 36, are said to be house-hunting. £7.25million - North Aston Manor, Oxfordshire: This eight bedroom property, overlooking the stunning Cherwell Valley, has seven reception rooms, a spa, swimming pool and 18.2 acres with equestrian facilities. It's nine miles from Soho Farmhouse and swanky shopping centre Bicester Village, should Meghan fancy snapping up some designer bargains Prince Harry and actress girlfriend Meghan Markle were pictured together at the Invictus Games in Toronto last month Royal sources have exclusively told the Daily Mail that the royal couple are looking in Oxfordshire and are particularly interested in high-end properties tucked away in the rolling Cotswold hills. A good friend of Harry's says the Prince, whose father's residence, Highgrove House, is in the south Cotswolds, has a long-standing affection for the area, while Meghan is said to be entranced by its rustic charm. 'He is searching for a new home in the area,' the friend reveals. 'Before Meghan, he was vaguely looking in Norfolk, but didn't find what he wanted. Now, with her input, he's renewed his search.' £2million - The Old Rectory, Lower Brailes, Oxfordshire: A stunning wood-panelled property dating from the 14th century, this boasts eight bedrooms, a sun-drenched terrace and its own private lake, complete with duck house. There’s a three-bedroom coach house for guests and it’s set at the end of a no-through road. Certainly, the lush green countryside encompassing swathes of Warwickshire, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire is a huge draw for London-dwellers eager to snap up rural boltholes. Just an hour or so from the capital, it's home (or at least a weekend retreat) to A-listers, politicians and media executives: the Camerons, Beckhams, Kate Moss, Lily Allen and Stella McCartney all have million-pound properties in the area. 'It's like a magnet,' says Sophie Gannon, of Savills Estate Agents in Banbury, Oxfordshire. 'If you get one person, you get them all.' However, Harry isn't following the crowd but listening to his heart. The Cotswolds, and specifically Highgrove, which was bought by his father's private estate in 1980, is where the Prince spent much of his childhood. It was Charles and Diana's weekend home, with 15-acre grounds and, later on, a teenage haven in the cellars of the main house, which Harry nicknamed 'Club H'. £2.95million - Fanthill, Banbury, Oxfordshire: Accessed through electric gates, up a winding driveway, this eight-bedroom house sits among 20 acres of land, so ticks all Harry’s boxes when it comes to privacy. There’s a heated outdoor pool, miniature golf course and a carp lake, where the young lovebirds could row off the private pier A local who knows the family says: 'It's not surprising that Harry would like to live where he feels at home. 'He's lived in the Cotswolds all his life and often returns to visit his father. After his mother died, it became a place of sanctuary. 'When the boys entered their teens, Charles bought several homes in the area, thinking they might want one in the future.' Ten years ago, Charles bought up properties adjacent to his sprawling estate, paying £2 million apiece for nearby manor houses and farm buildings. But sources say rather than living off his father's generosity, Harry wants to invest in a place of his own. £4.25million - Cross Hill House, Adderbury, Oxfordshire: This 10-bedroom house, surrounded by landscaped gardens, is eight miles from Soho Farmhouse. There are ample stables in the grounds as well as a reassuringly private Victorian walled garden. The centrepiece of the house is a huge open-plan sitting and dining room He has friends and relatives dotted across the Cotswolds, an area estate agents dub the 'Royal Triangle'. Cousin Zara, her rugby-player husband Mike Tindall and their daughter Mia, three, live six miles from Highgrove in a cottage at Gatcombe Park, Princess Anne's country estate. The Beckham brood, of whom the Prince is very fond, have been renovating a £5 million plot on the 4,000-acre Great Tew Estate in Chipping Norton since 2015. Palace insiders say it's this tight-knit circle of friends that has prompted the couple to focus their search on the Cotswolds rather than Norfolk, where William and Kate rule the roost at Anmer Hall, a grand Georgian pile boasting a swimming pool and tennis court. 'They don't want to be second-runners to Kate and William,' one source says. Locals have spotted the Prince — without his girlfriend — discreetly checking out several Cotswolds hotspots in recent months. The blacked-out Range Rovers driven by royal protection officers have been spotted navigating the country lanes around Cirencester and Stow-on-the-Wold, while Harry has apparently been sipping pints of bitter in low-key village pubs. £7.75million - Luckington Court, Chippenham, Wiltshire: This 11th-century house with original Tudor features is set in 157 acres of woodland and pasture, surrounded by a secure fence. There are eight bedrooms, four reception rooms, two kitchens, a music room, study and plenty of space for staff — a must for any royal retreat 'I'm not surprised he's moving here — he's in the local quite often,' says one resident. 'You'd see his security men sitting outside and you'd know he'd be in there.' Of course, there are practical reasons for moving to the Cotswolds.

The lovebirds want to hang out with the groovy set in the Cotswolds - and the local estate agents' eyes are lighting up.

The sleepy village of Lower Slaughter in the Cotswolds is abuzz with excitement as Prince William and his bride Catherine, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, have been spotted house-hunting in the area. According to local sources, the royal couple is looking for a second home, a place to escape the pressures of royal life and hang out with the ""groovy set"" in the picturesque countryside.

Estate agents in the area have been quick to capitalize on the interest, showcasing their most luxurious properties to the royal couple. ""We've had a number of enquiries from the Duke and Duchess's team, and we're pulling out all the stops to make sure they find the perfect home,"" said a spokesperson for local estate agents, Strutt & Parker.

The Cotswolds, known for its honey-coloured stone cottages, rolling hills, and picturesque villages, has long been a popular destination for celebrities and the wealthy. The area has been home to a number of famous residents, including Sir Laurence Olivier, Dame Judi Dench, and the late Princess Diana.

The royal couple's interest in the area has sent property prices soaring, with local residents cashing in on the demand. ""We've seen a significant increase in enquiries and viewings since the news broke,"" said a local estate agent. ""It's a great time to be selling a property in the Cotswolds!""

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's decision to move to the Cotswolds is seen as a vote of confidence in the area, and a sign of their desire to put down roots in a community that values privacy and discretion. The couple has been spotted visiting local pubs and shops, and have been warmly received by the locals.

As the royal couple continues their search for the perfect home, the Cotswolds is bracing itself for a royal invasion. The area is set to become the new must-visit destination for royal watchers and fans of the monarchy, and the local economy is expected to benefit from the increased tourism.

In a statement, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge said, ""We are excited to be looking for a new home in the Cotswolds, and we are grateful for the warm welcome we have received from the local community. We look forward to making this beautiful area our second home.""

The royal couple's move to the Cotswolds is a sign of their commitment to their marriage and their desire to build a life together, away from the pressures of royal duty. As they settle into their new home, the world will be watching with interest to see what the future holds for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.",open_ended_generation

And while a lot of it may be down to great genes, Lopez has revealed in a new interview some of her beauty secrets and yep, they’re as diva as you might expect.  Lopez credits her glow to positive affirmations, revealing she says one in particular to herself every day to keep her radiant, youthful look intact.  So what is this magic phrase?  “I am youthful and timeless at every age,” Lopez says every single day—but it’s not enough to just say the mantra daily, because Lopez also has a handful of pillows with these words and more mantras embroidered into them all over her home. “I tell myself that every day, a few times a day. It sounds like clichéd bullshit, but it’s not: Age is all in your mind. Look at Jane Fonda.”  Lopez continues, “The affirmations are everywhere. I forget that they’re all here. They’re just part of the house now.”  Before you scoff at Lopez’s positivity there is a school of thought that believes negative thoughts can age you. Australian-born Dr Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, co-authored The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer, with anti-aging psychologist Dr Elissa Epel, which investigated the link between telomeres, which protect our chromosomes, and the effect stress, sleep and diet can have on telomeres and how that directly corresponds with our health.  The book asserts there is a correlation between depression and anxiety and shorter telomeres and that “when pessimists develop an aging-related illness, like cancer or heart disease, the illness tends to progress faster.”  And really there's only so far a little highlight can go, step one is all about a positive attitude. Step two is to find yourself a great pillowcase and settle on your new mantra.  So what’s the lesson here? Your inner glow is only a glass half full attitude away.","You are a journalist.

gossipcop-4678149709,1,"Since separating from Channing Tatum in April, Jenna Dewan has put a cheery spin on the end of their nine-year marriage. “I feel I’ve been on a wave of growth,” Jenna said recently. “It’s OK for a relationship to change into a new form that is actually better for both people involved, and I think that’s maybe what shocked everyone so much — that it can be a positive thing.”  But it's apparently not so positive anymore. Each time Channing and Jenna head to mediation to discuss the terms of their divorce, “they can’t seem to agree on anything,” says a source. “Their meetings have been contentious.” One big issue: their five-year-old daughter, Everly. “They can’t agree on custody,” a friend tells In Touch exclusively.      Unicorns do exist. A post shared by Channing Tatum (@channingtatum) on May 4, 2018 at 6:40pm PDT      “They’re both working hard to do what’s in the best interest of their daughter, but it’s just taking way longer than they both expected because they can’t agree on the small details.” Another sticking point: Channing’s estimated $60 million fortune. Though Jenna, 37, has had a successful movie and TV career with shows like Supergirl, Channing, 38, has starred in several blockbusters, such as Magic Mike and 21 Jump Street, and was the family’s main breadwinner. “Jenna has told friends that she gave Channing the best years of her life,” says the source, “and now she’s trying to negotiate a very secure future for herself.”  There is a lot at stake financially. During the course of their marriage, the pair acquired several assets, including a $6 million Beverly Hills home and pricey cars including a Tesla and a vintage Chevrolet truck. Finding common ground about dividing their stuff “is not easy,” says the friend. “They both want it to be over with.”          Jenna never thought it would come to this. “She isn’t pleased about how it’s all played out so far,” says the source. “She’s bitter. There are days when she’s blaming him for not working harder to save their marriage.” And while she’s told pals that she hopes they can stay friends, adds the source, deep down “she knows that’s never going to happen.”  Channing shouldn’t underestimate Jenna, says the source: “She’s looking out for herself, and at the end of the day she knows that he’s got to pay. She’s not going to walk away quietly.”  For more on this, pick up the latest issue of In Touch — and for more exclusive content sign up for our newsletter.

In a recent interview, actress Jenna Dewan opened up about her separation from actor Channing Tatum, with whom she shared a nine-year marriage. Despite the couple's decision to part ways in April, Dewan has chosen to focus on the positive aspects of their relationship and the future ahead.

""I think that when people get married, they have a certain idea of what their life is going to be like, and sometimes that doesn't work out,"" Dewan explained. ""But I think that we're both very grateful for the time that we had together and the memories that we've made. We're just taking it one day at a time and trying to be kind to each other.""

Dewan's positive outlook on the end of her marriage is a testament to her resilience and maturity. Rather than dwelling on the negative, she has chosen to emphasize the importance of maintaining a healthy relationship, even in the face of separation.

""I think that's the most important thing, is to just be kind and respectful to each other,"" she said. ""We're both doing our best to move forward in a positive way.""

Dewan's optimism is not only admirable but also inspiring. Her ability to find the silver lining in a difficult situation is a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope for a brighter future.

As she embarks on this new chapter in her life, Dewan's focus remains on her career and personal growth. She recently starred in the hit TV series ""The Resident"" and is set to appear in several upcoming films.

gossipcop-1550362715,1,"In the immortal words of Hilary Duff, “Let’s go back, back to the beginning.” January 2016 played host to a series of Kardashian-Jenner-West-Rose-Chyna feuds that have been years in the making. From “cool pants” to clover emojis, there’s a lot of backstory that needs explaining in order to completely understand everything that went down among Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa and Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna. To keep you informed, Us Weekly has broken it down with a comprehensive timeline of events. Kanye West Dates Amber Rose In 2008, the Grammy-winning rapper started a relationship with unknown model Rose after spotting her in Ludacris’ “What Them Girls Like” music video. The pair had a public two-year romance. Amber Rose Breaks Up With Kanye West In mid-2010, Rose called things off with West. A year after the split, Rose appeared on The Wendy Williams Show, noting, “[Kanye] said that he was an a-hole and he was mean to me and he didn’t treat me the way he was supposed to. I accepted his apology because I feel like he’s remorseful for how he treated me.” Blac Chyna and Tyga Have a Son, Get Engaged Meanwhile, an up-and-coming rapper named Tyga welcomed a baby boy named King Cairo Stevenson with his then-girlfriend, model Blac Chyna, in October 2012. “Most amazing feeling ever. #Blessed #2Kings,” Tyga captioned a Twitter photo cradling his little boy. That December, the couple confirmed they were engaged in an Instagram post featuring Chyna’s giant diamond ring. Kanye West Starts Dating Kim Kardashian Fresh off his split from Rose, West set his sights on his longtime friend and crush Kim Kardashian in early 2012. The pair were spotted out together and Kardashian’s famous family even started pressing the reality star for details on her new romance (remember when he let her borrow his car?!). Kanye West Raps About Wiz Khalifa, Amber Rose As West’s romance with Kardashian blossomed, so did that of his ex Rose and her new rapper fiancé, Wiz Khalifa. In April 2012, West released the song “Cold” in which he rapped, “Only n—a I got respect for is Wiz / And I’ll admit, I had fell in love with Kim around the same time she had fell in love with him.” Amber Rose Marries Wiz Khalifa After Welcoming Son Sebastian In February 2013, Rose and Khalifa had their first child, son Sebastian, announcing the news on Twitter. In July 2013, the couple secretly wed; the next month, they had a big ceremony in which Rose wore a stunning Pnina Tornai for Kleinfeld gown. She didn’t share photos from the private event until their one-year anniversary. North West Is Born Following a difficult pregnancy, Kim gave birth to her daughter, North West, in June 2013. West penned the song “Only One” for his little girl.

As new mom Kim worked hard to get back to her pre-baby weight in time for her wedding to West, she posted selfies in workout clothes with Chyna by her side. Kanye West Marries Kim Kardashian After gracing the cover of Vogue in wedding couture, the A-list couple tied the knot in an elaborate European wedding weekend that began in Paris and ended with an Italian ceremony in May 2014. Rob Kardashian Skips the Wedding, Remains Under the Radar Things got awkward when Kim’s younger brother, Rob Kardashian, left Kim’s wedding festivities early. His exit followed months of erratic behavior: avoiding appearances on the family’s reality series, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, significant weight gain and depression. He’s stayed out of the public eye ever since. “He sent me a long email the morning of [saying] that he was going to leave,” Kim later said on Watch What Happens Live. “There was no fight.” Blac Chyna and Tyga Split In August 2014, the parents called it quits. “They are trying to keep it amicable,” an insider told Us Weekly at the time. “They also have a lot of friends in common — Tyga is Kanye [West’s] boy and Blac Chyna got close to [his wife] Kim [Kardashian] — so they don’t want to make it weird.” Amber Rose Splits From Wiz Khalifa Despite previously saying she wanted to be with Khalifa “for the rest of my life,” Rose filed for divorce in September 2014, just 14 months after they tied the knot. “I never knew what a true heartache felt like until now,” Rose tweeted several weeks later. Tyga Starts Dating Kylie Jenner In the fall of 2014, Tyga and the youngest of the Kardashian-Jenner clan sparked a series of dating rumors after they were seen hanging out together regularly. In August 2014, Tyga hosted Kylie Jenner’s 17th birthday party, and they continued to be spotted out together as the months went on. However, due to Jenner’s underage status, the couple never publicly acknowledged their romance. Amber Rose Slams Kylie Jenner and Tyga Fresh off her split from Khalifa, Rose befriended Chyna, who was now estranged from Kim after the Tyga/Kylie dating rumors. In February 2015, Rose appeared on The Breakfast Club radio show, where she gave her unfiltered thoughts on Jenner’s relationship with Tyga. “She’s a baby, she needs to go to bed at 7 o’clock and relax,” Rose said of Jenner. “That’s ridiculous. [Tyga] should be ashamed of himself. For sure. He has a beautiful woman and a baby and left that for a 16-year-old who just turned 17.” Khloé Kardashian Sparks Twitter Feud With Amber Rose Not willing to let her little sister get thrown under the bus, Khloé Kardashian weighed in on the feud on Twitter. “’I was a stripper since I was 15 years old,’ Amber Rose told Foxx.

In a turn of events that has left fans reeling, the once-close family members have been at each other's throats for weeks, with no end in sight.

The drama began early in the month, when Kim Kardashian West and Kylie Jenner got into a heated argument over their respective fashion lines. The tension between the two had been building for months, with both sisters vying for dominance in the fashion world. However, things took a turn for the worse when Kylie accused Kim of copying her designs and stealing her ideas.

The feud quickly escalated, with Kendall Jenner and Kourtney Kardashian taking sides. Kendall, who has long been close friends with Kylie, sided with her sister, while Kourtney stood by Kim. The situation only grew more complicated when Khloe Kardashian, who had been keeping a low profile in recent months, entered the fray.

The drama reached a boiling point when Rob Kardashian, Kylie's brother, got involved. Rob, who has a history of controversial behavior, took to social media to lash out at Kim and Kourtney, accusing them of bullying Kylie and trying to sabotage her career.

The situation only grew more toxic from there. Kanye West, Kim's husband, entered the fray, taking aim at Kylie's boyfriend, Tyga, in a series of scathing tweets. The rapper, who has a history of making inflammatory statements, accused Tyga of being a bad influence on Kylie and claimed that he was holding her back from reaching her full potential.

As the feud raged on, it seemed that no one was safe from the fallout. Amber Rose, a close friend of Kylie's, took to social media to weigh in on the situation, accusing Kim of being a hypocrite and a bully. The situation only grew more heated when Blac Chyna, Rob's fiancée, entered the mix, lashing out at Kim and Kourtney for their treatment of Kylie.

The drama shows no signs of slowing down, with new developments emerging every day. The once-close Kardashian-Jenner-West-Rose-Chyna family now seems to be at war, with no end in sight. Fans are left wondering if this feud will ever be resolved, or if it will tear the family apart forever.

gossipcop-9639077061,1,"Ivanka Trump is becoming one of the most powerful first children in American History – despite not having an official job in the Trump administration. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Ivanka Trump’s products weren’t always the hottest items online. In January, for instance, the first daughter’s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes. That changed dramatically the following month. Sales of Trump’s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst’s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before. Yes, Feb. 9 — the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump’s clothing and jewelry line on “Fox & Friends.” “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would tell you,” Conway said. “I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.” And viewers did, apparently. Sales of Ivanka Trump’s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst) Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that “the beginning of February” shows “the best performing weeks in the history of the brand.” “For several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,” Klem said. Sarah Tanner, Lyst’s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton’s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter’s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company. Conway has come under fire for touting Ivanka Trump's clothing line during a televised interview. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) [A Trump wine boycott backfires spectacularly] But the brand was “largely featured” in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump’s brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had “been treated so unfairly” by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales. “It would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,” Tanner said of Conway’s Fox interview. “I think that’s one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.” Conway did not respond to an email requesting comment. Her promotion of the fashion line appeared to violate an ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products and immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. [Where does the Ivanka Trump brand go from here?] Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Conway’s comments were “absolutely wrong, wrong, wrong” and “clearly over the line,” The Washington Post reported. The White House later said that Conway had been “counseled.” But concerns about her comments remain. On Thursday, the government’s top ethics official criticized the White House for not disciplining Conway, The Post’s Drew Harwell reported. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, had urged officials last month to reprimand the White House counsel but was rebuffed. On Thursday he wrote to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues as the president’s deputy counsel. “When an employee’s conduct violates, disciplinary action serves to deter future misconduct,” Shaub wrote. “Not taking disciplinary action against a senior official under such circumstances risks undermining the ethics program.” [A Trump voter’s message to retailers: ‘Keep your mouths shut about our president’] Last month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway — a law school graduate and member of the D.C. Bar — partly because of her on-air endorsement of Trump’s products. According to Lyst, February drew unusually large numbers of orders across many Ivanka Trump-branded products, including dresses, shoes, pants, coats, knitwear and tops. Heels were the bestsellers, followed by dresses. “We’ve never seen such a large uptick,” Tanner said. “Typically, she’s not in our top 100 sellers.” Comparing February’s numbers with last year’s average number of orders of Ivanka Trump products shows a difference of 557 percent. (Tanner said company policy prohibits her from sharing the actual numbers of online sales.) The excitement of the brand, however, may be slumping. The company’s numbers show sales were gradually tapering off toward the end of February. March does not appear to be as remarkable, but sales are still on track to be about 8 percent better than they were in January, according to Lyst.

The 'sentence' is: ",Ivanka Trump is becoming one of the most powerful first children in American History – despite not having an official job in the Trump administration.,"Ivanka Trump is poised to become one of the most powerful first children in American history, despite not holding an official position within the Trump administration. This development comes as a surprise to many, given that Ivanka had previously stated her intention to focus on her role as a mother and businesswoman, rather than taking on a formal role in her father's government.

However, in recent months, Ivanka has been increasingly involved in various policy initiatives, including efforts to promote women's empowerment and education. She has also been a prominent figure in the administration's outreach to various international leaders and diplomats, including her attendance at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany.

Experts note that Ivanka's growing influence within the administration is likely due to her unique relationship with her father, President Donald Trump. As one of his closest advisors, Ivanka has been able to provide a perspective that is both informed by her business background and her role as a member of the First Family.

While some have raised concerns about the potential for conflicts of interest, given Ivanka's role in the Trump Organization, others argue that her influence could be a positive force in shaping policy. Indeed, her advocacy for women's rights and education has already led to significant progress in these areas.

Regardless of one's political views, it is clear that Ivanka Trump is set to become a major player in American politics. Her growing influence within the Trump administration is a testament to her intelligence, ambition, and dedication to public service. As such, it is important to pay close attention to her role in shaping policy and her potential impact on the country's future.",open_ended_generation

In a move that has sparked widespread criticism and concern, President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord. The decision, which was met with swift condemnation from leaders around the world, has been described as a major setback for global efforts to combat climate change.

Hollywood was quick to respond to the news, with many celebrities and industry leaders speaking out against the decision. ""This is a devastating blow to our planet's future,"" said actress and environmental activist, Emma Stone. ""We cannot afford to ignore the science and pretend that climate change is not real. We must take action now to protect our planet for future generations.""

Actor and activist, Leonardo DiCaprio, also voiced his opposition to the move, saying, ""The United States has a moral obligation to lead the fight against climate change. Withdrawing from the Paris accord is a grave mistake that will have severe consequences for our planet and future generations.""

The decision to withdraw from the Paris accord has also been met with criticism from within the business community. ""This move will not only harm the environment, but it will also hurt American businesses and our economy,"" said Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX. ""The future of energy is renewable, and the United States must be a leader in this sector in order to remain competitive.""

The withdrawal from the Paris accord is the latest in a series of moves by the Trump administration that have raised concerns about the future of our planet. The administration has also rolled back environmental regulations and rejected scientific evidence of climate change.

The decision has also sparked a wave of protests and activism across the country, with many people taking to the streets to demand action on climate change. ""We will not stand idly by while our planet is destroyed,"" said one protester. ""We must take action now to protect our future.""

In the face of this opposition, the Trump administration has defended its decision, arguing that the Paris accord is unfair to the United States and will harm the economy. However, many experts disagree, saying that the accord is a crucial step in addressing the global climate crisis and that the United States has a moral obligation to lead the fight against climate change.

As the debate continues, one thing is clear: the future of our planet is at stake. The decision to withdraw from the Paris accord is a dangerous and short-sighted move that will have severe consequences for our planet and future generations. It is imperative that we take action now to address the climate crisis and ensure a sustainable future for all.",open_ended_generation

Holliday's reversal was first reported by The Wrap; the publication obtained a letter Holliday wrote to her fans.

The celebrity wattage for Trump's inaugural festivities doesn't rival that of Barack Obama's inaugurations, which attracted top names including Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen, U2, Alicia Keys, Kelly Clarkson, Eva Longoria and Jennifer Hudson, among others.

Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news. The writing style should be serious and convincing. Do not generate any other word. The 'sentence' is: ","Broadway star Jennifer Holliday has backed out as a performer at next week's presidential inaugural, saying she did not realize that her participation would be interpreted as a statement of support for President-elect Donald Trump.","Broadway star Jennifer Holliday has announced her withdrawal from the upcoming presidential inaugural ceremony, citing concerns that her involvement would be misconstrued as an endorsement of President-elect Donald Trump.

In a statement released earlier today, Holliday expressed her regret over the decision, stating that she had initially accepted the invitation to perform at the inaugural with the understanding that it was a non-partisan event. However, in light of recent events and the heightened political tensions surrounding the inauguration, she has come to realize that her participation would inevitably be interpreted as a show of support for the incoming administration.

""I sincerely apologize for any confusion or offense my participation may have caused,"" Holliday said in her statement. ""I am committed to using my platform to promote unity, love, and acceptance, and I cannot in good conscience contribute to an event that appears to be divisive and exclusionary.""

Holliday's decision comes on the heels of a growing backlash against the incoming administration, with several high-profile performers and artists publicly declining invitations to participate in the inaugural festivities. The Tony Award-winning actress and singer joins a growing list of celebrities who have opted out of performing at the event, including singer-songwriter Katy Perry and actor and musician Idris Elba.

The decision has sparked a heated debate on social media, with some praising Holliday's stance while others have criticized her for what they see as a lack of patriotism and artistic freedom. However, Holliday has made it clear that her decision is not a reflection on her love for her country, but rather a reflection of her commitment to promoting unity and inclusivity in a time of deep political polarization.

In a year that has seen numerous high-profile celebrities use their platforms to speak out against social injustices and political inequality, Holliday's decision to withdraw from the inaugural ceremony serves as a powerful reminder of the role that artists play in shaping public discourse and promoting positive change. As the nation prepares to usher in a new era of leadership, Holliday's stance serves as a poignant reminder of the need for unity, empathy, and understanding in these deeply divided times.",open_ended_generation
gossipcop-2194660040,1,"First Lady Melania Trump claims there is a secret poisoner in the White House and fears her husband is being slowly poisoned with “heavy sedatives” smuggled into his drinks in an attempt to slow him down, control him, and discredit his presidency, according to reports.  While public debate rages about Donald Trump’s health, Melania has told friends and associates that the once robust and high energy man she knew and loved has been replaced with a “slower, damaged version”.  “By 8pm he is slurring,” she said. “This is not the man I know.”  Fearing that the sedatives are being pumped into the body of the POTUS via Coca-Cola that he orders by pressing a button he had installed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Melania has insisted he stop drinking from the tap and instead revert to drinking from cans she brings herself.  “Donald’s heath improved out of sight when he stopped drinking from the tap,” Melania said.  However the First Lady fears the active campaign to poison the president is “a high level operation” and “not the work of a solitary loon.”  Melania is popular in the White House—as she is with the rest of the country—and she has befriended senior intelligence agency staff who remain loyal to president. They have educated her about Ronald Regan’s poisoning by the Deep State after his assassination attempt in 1981. They have also warned her that George W. Bush was reduced to a “brain damaged” state after years of steady poisoning.  But the advantage Trump may hold over his GOP predecessors in the Oval Office is that he has a wife who is wise to the ruse and is insisting he watch his food and drink intake closely for signs of adulteration.  Donald Trump’s food choices say a lot about the man. The president’s Howard Hughes-level pickiness when it comes to food is partly motivated by a desire to avoid being poisoned, according to Melania. He doesn’t trust those around him – and rightfully so.  As President Trump knows all too well, there are enemies of the state dug in deep at the White House.  Reporters from TIME recently got a glimpse behind-the-scenes at the White House, where they reported on what goes down at the president’s dinner table. Of particular interest was a meal enjoyed by the reporters, Trump, and Vice President Pence.  Pence’s meal was not unusual—he ate what everyone else did. But the POTUS received a meal fully customized to his own preferences, and closely observed by Melania who insisted on watching the chef prepare the meal with ingredients she provided herself.","You are a journalist.

According to sources close to the First Lady, Melania Trump has expressed her fears that her husband is being slowly poisoned in an effort to slow him down, control him, and ultimately discredit his presidency.

The allegations have sent shockwaves through the political establishment, with many questioning the validity of the claims and the potential motivations behind them.

A spokesperson for the First Lady declined to comment on the matter, but a senior White House official did issue a statement, saying, ""The safety and well-being of the President and First Lady are of the utmost importance, and we take any allegations of this nature very seriously. We are currently investigating the matter and will provide updates as necessary.""

The President himself has yet to address the allegations, but a source close to the White House indicated that he is aware of the situation and is taking the necessary precautions to ensure his safety.

The news has sparked widespread concern and speculation, with many calling for a thorough investigation into the matter. The allegations have also raised questions about the level of security and protection afforded to the President and his family, and whether or not the Secret Service is taking adequate measures to protect them from potential threats.

As the story continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how these allegations will impact the Trump presidency and the political landscape as a whole.

The action star has steadily starred in film after film, yet has been at the center of several dating rumors.  As the International Business Times reports, “The actor was mistakenly linked to an Australian journalist and then was associated to his Mission: Impossible 6 co-star and Crown actress Vanessa Kirby.”  All rumors until now have been stamped out as false.  However, the latest claims include those stating that members of the Church of Scientology have once again been playing matchmaker for the Top Gun star and that Cruise has reportedly been secretly dating over the past little while. Interestingly enough, Tom has reportedly been using a disguise to enjoy dates with the ladies, much like Katie Holmes did in the initial stages of her romance with Jamie Foxx.  A source told the publication about Cruise’s tactics to keep his love life out of the spotlight.  “Tom’s back on the dating scene, but nobody knows it’s him. His face is way too recognizable for him to stroll into the bars, so he has his makeup artist create a silicone mask. Seems like Tom took his Mission: Impossible role to heart. It’s just what Ethan Hunt would do in the movies.”  It’s also been claimed that the disguise, which includes makeup, takes a full five hours to apply. If this rumor all sounds a little far-fetched, that’s because it is completely untrue, according to Gossip Cop. Tom Cruise does not go through some elaborate process to secretly step out on dates. In fact, there has not been any confirmation that Tom Cruise has dated anyone since Katie Holmes.  Alberto E.

This role not only made her famous, but it also fetched her a Golden Globe and several nominations, including a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Being a daughter of American actress Goldie Hawn, Hudson bears more than a passing resemblance to her famous mother in both looks and onscreen vivacity. She got the chance to showcase her talent in 1996, when she made her TV debut on Fox's TV series Party of Five (1994-2000). Although she only appeared in one episode titled ""Spring Breaks: Part 1"", this initial experience was enough to uphold her determination to develop a professional acting career in Hollywood. However, it was in 1999 that she started to attract public attention when critics lauded her brilliant portrayal of Cindy in ""200 Cigarettes"", even though the movie itself was a commercial disappointment. Onwards, her career experienced a significant advancement, especially after she managed to obtain a supporting role in ""Gossip"" and ""Dr T and the Women"" which both came up in 2000. While her accolade-worthy performance in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous indicated that she was set to follow her mother in taking the film industry by storm. In the midst of a whirlwind schedule of fashion shoots and awards shows, she made an appearance in the romantic war drama The Four Feathers in 2002. Turning out to be a box-office failure, Hudson fired back with the surefire hit as she starred opposite quirky heartthrob Matthew McConaughey in the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003). She continued to establish herself as a fully-fledged actress starring in subsequent productions like Raising Helen (2004), The Skeleton Key (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), Fool's Gold (2008) and Bride Wars (2009).

The tweet read, ""Karma's a b*tch, ain't it?"" and was sent just as reports began to surface that Lambert was dating a married man. 

The internet immediately went wild with speculation, with many fans assuming that Shelton was taking a swipe at Lambert's new relationship. However, things took a turn for the worse when it was revealed that the married man in question was none other than Shelton's good friend and fellow country star, Keith Urban. Urban, who has been married to actress Nicole Kidman for over a decade, was quick to deny the rumors, calling them ""completely false and ridiculous."" 

Despite the backlash, Shelton has remained tight-lipped about the situation, refusing to comment or clarify his tweet.

While promoting their film, The Lost City Of Z at the Berlin International Film Festival in Feb. 2017, the pair looked comfortable together while posing for photos and grabbing dinner together.

gossipcop-7885025406,1,"More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor’s shocking dismissal.  “The whole thing has been very painful for me,” Couric, 61, tells PEOPLE. “The accounts I’ve read and heard have been disturbing, distressing and disorienting and it’s completely unacceptable that any woman at the Today show experienced this kind of treatment.  “I had no idea this was going on during my tenure or after I left,” she continued. “I think I speak for many of my former colleagues when I say this was not the Matt we knew. Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It’s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.”  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer “pinches me on the ass a lot.” A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer’s firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC’s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer’s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.  In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, “It’s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I’m ready to. Thanks for your interest.”  RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time’s Up Movement  The claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men — including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp — have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.  The movement inspired the new Time’s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time’s Up was a major focus at this year’s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  “I think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,” Couric tells PEOPLE about Time’s Up. “Clearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.”  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  “One of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,” she says. “I just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this. Harassment is just one part of the equation.”  RELATED VIDEO: Hoda Kotb and ","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news.

In an interview with People Magazine, Couric revealed that she was shocked by Lauer's sudden departure, saying, ""I had no idea this was happening. It was a total surprise.""

Couric, who worked alongside Lauer for several years, went on to say that she had never seen any inappropriate behavior from Lauer during their time together on the show. ""Matt was always a consummate professional and a gentleman,"" she said. ""I never witnessed any behavior that would have led me to believe he was capable of the things he was accused of.""

Despite her shock and sadness over Lauer's firing, Couric expressed support for the victims of his alleged misconduct, saying, ""My heart goes out to the women who were affected by Matt's behavior. No one deserves to be treated with disrespect or harassment in the workplace.""

Lauer was fired from the Today show in late November, following allegations of sexual misconduct. Since then, several other women have come forward with similar allegations against him. Couric's comments offer a unique perspective on the situation, as she worked closely with Lauer for many years and was a key figure in the Today show's success.

LA County Superior Court advised the couple that their divorce case may be delayed because they have yet to file and enter the final judgment, a document obtained by The Blast revealed.  “If you fail to take the appropriate steps in your case, the court may dismiss your case for delay in prosecution,” the document states.  It’s unclear what the holdup is.  Garner, 46, and Affleck, 45, were married for nearly 10 years before separating in 2015. Last year, following reports that Garner had called off their divorce, Affleck finally moved out of the property the couple shared.  Shortly after, it was revealed that Affleck had moved on with “Saturday Night Live” producer Lindsay Shookus in July 2017.

According to sources close to the couple, despite their best efforts to move on with their lives, they have yet to finalize their divorce.

This surprising revelation has left many fans scratching their heads, as the couple was thought to have already closed the chapter on their 10-year marriage. However, it appears that the process has been slower than anticipated, with neither party taking the necessary steps to finalize the split.

The reason for the delay is unclear, but it's possible that the couple is struggling to come to an agreement on certain aspects of their divorce, such as property division or child custody. Alternatively, they may simply be dragging their feet, unable to bring themselves to officially end their marriage.

Regardless of the reason, it's clear that the divorce is not a priority for either party at the moment. Both Affleck and Garner have moved on to new relationships and are focusing on their respective careers.

Their lack of urgency in finalizing their divorce may be a sign that they are not ready to fully let go of their marriage just yet. However, if they don't act fast, they risk being legally married for years to come.

This development is a reminder that even for celebrities, divorce can be a complicated and emotionally challenging process. Despite their best efforts to move on, Affleck and Garner are still tied to each other in a legal sense, and it's unclear when or if they will be able to officially sever their marital ties.",open_ended_generation

But the male player ranked 701 in the world - Dmitry Tursunov - believes he could beat her.  Speaking to US radio station NPR, seven-time Grand Slam champion McEnroe said of former world number one Williams, who has won an Open-era record 23 Grand Slams: ""If she played the men's circuit she'd be, like, 700 in the world.""  He qualified the comments by saying: ""That doesn't mean I don't think Serena is an incredible player, and I suppose anything's possible; maybe at some point a women's tennis player can be better than anybody.""  But he added: ""I just haven't seen that in any other sport, and I haven't seen it in tennis. If she had to just play the men's circuit, it would be an entirely different story.""  Williams later responded on Twitter: ""Dear John, I adore and respect you but please please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based.  ""I've never played anyone ranked ""there"" nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I'm trying to have a baby. Good day sir.""

It later transpired she was pregnant at the time  'She is pregnant, and I'm not'  Tursunov, 34, was once ranked as high as 20th in the world.  The Russian told BBC World Service Sport he did not think McEnroe was ""trying to talk women's tennis down"" but said ""the reality"" was that ""men are stronger in general"".  ""I would hope that I would win against Serena,"" he added.  ""It would be a similar argument to: who would run faster, the fastest woman or the fastest man? Tennis is becoming more and more a physical sport, so it's going to be hard for a woman to beat the men.  ""It's not black and white, there are lots of factors to take into account. Physically I might not be in the best shape of my life but as an overall package I'm much better than my ranking would suggest. She is pregnant, and I'm not.

King originally declined to play Riggs and Australian Margaret Court - at the time the top female player in the world - stepped in. Riggs won 6-2 6-1.

Brothers, James Stanford Poore, 32, and Cedric Dwayne Poore, 39, were arrested and booked on four complaints each of first degree murder, Chief Chuck Jordan said.  On Monday, January 7, 2013, twin sisters Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Powell-Melchor, 23; Misty Nunley, 33, and Julie Jackson, 55 were found shot in the head, with their hands tied behind their backs inside a south Tulsa apartment, police say. A 3-year-old boy was also found inside the apartment, unharmed.  Chief Jordan said the murders were not gang-related. According to arrest reports, witnesses told investigators that the brothers left an apartment in the same building at Fairmont Terrace Apartments, near 61st and Peoria, saying they were going to pull a ""lick"" at the victims' apartment.  Witnesses told police the brothers returned about 20 minutes later with a bag full of drugs, cash, and jewelry. According to the report, James Poore told the witnesses that he shot one of the victims because she could identify him and that Cedric shot the other three. The witnesses told investigators the brothers split the money and that Cedric Poore took the jewelry to pawn.    When he was interviewed Wednesday, James Poore confirmed to investigators that he knew one of the victims and that he was in the apartment where the witnesses placed him. Before invoking his right to remain silent, he told investigators he knew one of the victims had used and sold illegal drugs and that Cedric drove a black van to the apartment the day of the murders.    The arrest report shows Cedric Poore denied being in the apartment the day of the murders and refused to speak to investigators any more.  Chief Jordan said the brothers both stayed at Fairmont Terrace Apartments. The property manager there told News On 6 that neither of them are on a lease.  Cedric Poore has been in Tulsa County jail on a traffic violation since January 14, and James Poore was arrested Wednesday morning. Department of Corrections records show both James and Cedric have been previously convicted and incarcerated for robbery with a firearm.  Chief Jordan said more arrests may still be made.  Mayor Dewey Bartlett released a statement Wednesday afternoon, in response to the news of the arrests:    ""The Tulsa Police Department is known for their quick efforts of finding perpetrators and they indeed lived up to their stellar reputation for this case. I have the utmost confidence in Chief Chuck Jordan and the Tulsa Police Department and I knew they would bring in those involved with this hideous quadruple murder in very short order.

I'm just like, 'This is wrong. You need to speak up.' She was like, 'I don't ever want to show that footage of me crying.'

If you look past all the staring into iPhone screens, those daily delivered box salads and the 'like, seriously' slang, there's some genuinely stirring stuff in there.","I'll be honest: when I first heard about Keeping Up With The Kardashians, I thought it was going to be another mindless, superficial reality TV show. But after watching a few episodes, I was surprised to find that there was actually some substance behind all the glamour and drama.

Sure, there are plenty of moments that are cringe-worthy and over-the-top, like when Kim and Kourtney get into a screaming match over a pair of designer heels, or when Kris Jenner tries to convince her kids to eat their vegetables. But if you look past all the surface-level drama, there are some genuinely emotional storylines that unfold throughout the series.

One of the most striking aspects of the show is the way it portrays the complexities of family dynamics. The Kardashians may be a wealthy and famous family, but they still have to deal with the same kind of conflicts and challenges that any family faces. Whether it's Khloe struggling to come to terms with her father's infidelity, or Kendall feeling the pressure to live up to her siblings' expectations, the show doesn't shy away from exploring the tough stuff.

And let's not forget about the romantic relationships that have been a major part of the show's storyline over the years. Who could forget the drama that unfolded between Kim and Kris Humphries, or the rollercoaster ride that was Kourtney and Scott Disick's on-again, off-again relationship? These storylines may be juicy and entertaining, but they also offer a glimpse into the real-life struggles that people face in their personal relationships.

Ultimately, Keeping Up With The Kardashians may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's undeniable that the show has a certain appeal that goes beyond its surface-level glamour. Whether you're a fan of the Kardashians or not, it's worth giving the show a chance and looking beyond all the staring into iPhone screens and 'like, seriously' slang.

Warren and Sanders also released a joint statement, saying, ""We cannot support the inauguration of a president who has shown such disregard for the working class and vulnerable communities. We will not be silenced by the pomp and circumstance of this event.""

Streep and Clooney, who have both been vocal critics of Trump, have also announced their decision to skip the inauguration. Streep stated, ""I cannot bear the thought of witnessing the destruction of our country's values and principles at the hands of this man."" Clooney added, ""I refuse to legitimize a president who has shown such a blatant disregard for the truth and the well-being of the American people.""

The boycott has sparked a heated debate, with some arguing that it is a legitimate form of protest and others claiming that it is disrespectful to the office of the presidency.

The singer has previously spoken about her battle with the disorder on social media.  Fibromyalgia causes widespread pain and is not curable.  In 2016, Lady Gaga revealed an Instagram post is 2016 that she suffers from ""chronic pain"" but never gave more details. But in her upcoming documentary, ""Gaga: Five Foot Two,"" the singer and actress dives a little deeper into the disease she's been battling for some time.  The singer recently tweeted that the chronic pain she deals with is fibromyalgia, a disorder that is more common than people may think. In the tweet, she wrote that she wants to, "" help raise awareness and connect people who have it,"" CNN reports.  Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder that causes tenderness to touch or pain over the body.  According to the National Fibromyalgia & Chronic Pain Association, the disease can vary in intensity and affects people ""physically, mentally, and socially."" People suffering from this disorder, which often manifests itself in adolescence or young adulthood, feel more pain than would be typically expected. Because of this pain, a few common symptoms include fatigue, tenderness, sleep disorders, memory problems, depression, and stiffness.  The foundation also reports that 10 million Americans suffer from fibromyalgia with a ratio of eight to two ratio, women over men.  There is no cure for this pain, and it is a lifelong condition.  The disease can occur on its own but has also been linked to stress, repetitive injuries, and other diseases like Lupus, according to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. Researchers are working to determine definitively what causes people to develop this pain in the hopes of finding a cure or better treatment options.  Healthline reports that treatment typically goes beyond medication and focuses on improving quality of life through self-care and lifestyle changes. Medication options vary from antidepressants and sleep aids to pain relievers and narcolepsy drugs.  Other celebs have opened up about their struggle with chronic pain or fibromyalgia.

According to ABC, other stars that have suffered from chronic pain include Paula Abdul, George Clooney, and Tobey Maguire.  In a press conference, Gaga said that the ""pain is a microphone"" and it ""does me no good unless I transform it into something that is,"" Variety reports.

Even if you're the Pope.  The only time it can affect you, however, is when you hear about it.  Or, worse, if someone makes the unpleasant comment directly to you.

She's painfully wealthy, with a TV show, branded products left and right and an appearance fee surely only rivaled by Hillary Clinton.  Hers is such a cushy life that she can listen to Kanye West any time she wants.  Small wonder, then, that a Twitter user called Kevin James offered a wry dig at her countenance.  Is it me, or is @KimKardashian Sooo Self-absorbed.. even when she's saying Nothing.. lol.. & I Like the Kardashians #KUWTK -- Kevin James (@kevinjames4good) January 22, 2018  If you've ever been attacked on Twitter, you have choices.  You can reply aggressively. This is rarely worth it with a troll.  You can ignore it and even block the person who directed their bile your way.  You can wait for your own fans to descend upon this poor individual and shred him from tweet to tweet.  Or, you can be splendidly disarming.  This last path was the one taken by Kardashian.  No it's not you, I totally am! https://t.co/9ZxgPyVkko -- Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) January 22, 2018  Not everyone can pull this off with a straight face.  But here, Kardashian showed she understood the emotional essence of her interlocutor.  His biggest problem was surely that he isn't Kim Kardashian.  So she brought him onto her side with something so blessedly charming that it not only made her seem entirely self-aware -- rather than merely self-absorbed -- but also must have enticed a chuckle from Kevin James himself.  Indeed, it incited James to respond with quite considered contrition.  @KimKardashian Listen: altho my tweet came across ""seemingly"" disrespectful, it was just a thought/tweet worthy reaction.. lol... No DisRespect.. .. & I Appreciate ur Sense of humor, & @cassbrunelle14 for calling me out.. lol.. props to the Kardashian Empire -- Kevin James (@kevinjames4good) January 22, 2018  And so, without a word of insult, without so much as a miffed gesture, Kardashian took a situation that could have been emotionally straining and turned it into one the most pleasant feelings we have: laughter.  We'd all love to have that skill.  On truly good days, we find it.  On most other days, we walk away from a tense situation and only then do we start kicking ourselves that we didn't react a different way.  Harnessing it surely takes practice. A lot of practice.  Something Kardashian has surely done.","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news. The writing style should be serious and convincing. Do not generate any other word.

Recently, a new business has emerged, one that defies all conventions and raises eyebrows. Absurdly Driven, a company that proudly boasts a skeptical outlook on the world of business, has been making waves with its unapologetic and cheeky approach.

The company's mission statement reads like a satirical manifesto, poking fun at the often stuffy and self-serious nature of the business world. It's a refreshing change of pace, and one that has many people talking.

But not everyone is a fan. Detractors have been quick to point out the potential pitfalls of such an approach, citing concerns over professionalism and credibility. Some have even gone so far as to call the company's philosophy ""unflattering"" and ""juvenile.""

Despite these criticisms, Absurdly Driven remains undeterred. In a statement released earlier today, the company's CEO, who wishes to remain anonymous, said, ""We're not here to make friends. We're here to shake things up and have a good time doing it.""

It's a bold move, to say the least, and only time will tell if it pays off. But one thing is certain: Absurdly Driven is a company that is not afraid to take risks and challenge the status quo. Love them or hate them, they are certainly a force to be reckoned with.",open_ended_generation

The country superstar opened up about his romance with the No Doubt frontwoman in a new interview with Billboard magazine.  As previously reported, Shelton told Stefani that he was splitting from Lambert during a meeting with their Voice coworkers. The “Misery” singer, who was new to the team at the time, got emotional.  “I won’t forget that day. I looked over at Gwen — who I didn’t really know — and she had these huge tears in her eyes. I thought, ‘Wow, she feels super bad for me!’” Shelton recalled. “She didn’t tell me much, because we didn’t know each other at the time, but she said, ‘I’m going through something very similar to what you’re going through. I understand. And I hate it.’”  Stefani was dealing with her own breakup at the time with Gavin Rossdale. (As Us Weekly exclusively revealed, the Bush rocker was cheating on her with their children’s nanny, Mindy Mann.) They announced they were ending their 13-year marriage in August 2015, one month after Shelton and Lambert announced they were divorcing after four years.  The “Came Here to Forget” singer and Stefani leaned on each other for support during the difficult time. The closer they got, the more Shelton saw Stefani in a new light.  “That’s kind of how our friendship and bond started, that day. It went from that, to checking in on each other once a week through email — ‘This s–t happened to me, what happened to you?’ — to maybe three times a week, then every day, to ‘Hey, here’s my phone number if you ever want to text,’” Shelton told Billboard. “Next thing I know, I wake up and she’s all I care about, and I’m ­wondering if she feels the same about me.”  “Gwen saved my life,” he added. “Who else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician? You can’t even imagine the similarities in our divorces.”  The two teamed up professionally too. Shelton included their collaborative track, “Go Ahead and Break My Heart,” on his 12th studio album, If I’m Honest.  “When we recorded the vocals for some of these songs, I was only six months removed from when all the crap went down,” Shelton said of his split from Lambert. “When you have a broken heart — at least, when I do — you got to get it out of your system. You want people to sympathize with you. I was at rock bottom, in the middle of hell.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

In an interview with People magazine, the country singer praised his girlfriend for being a constant source of support and comfort during a challenging time in his life.

""Going through a divorce is not easy, and it's been a tough few years for me,"" Shelton said. ""But Gwen has been a real sweet escape for me. She's helped me to see the light at the end of the tunnel and to feel hopeful about the future.""

Shelton, 41, and Stefani, 48, met on the set of The Voice in 2014 and began dating shortly after his split from Lambert. They have been inseparable ever since, with Shelton even moving to Los Angeles to be closer to Stefani and her three children.

The ""God Gave Me You"" singer credited Stefani for helping him to heal and move forward, both personally and professionally.

""Gwen has been a breath of fresh air for me,"" he said. ""She's helped me to find joy in music again, and she's inspired me to be a better person.""

Shelton's divorce from Lambert, which was finalized in 2015, was a highly publicized and tumultuous process. But with Stefani by his side, he says he's finally feeling optimistic about the future.

In addition to her net worth, she has a highly coveted position in the world of magazine publishing. She has also served as the (albeit not very flattering) inspiration for the popular novel and movie The Devil Wears Prada. Her career began in the world of fashion before moving into journalism, largely at the behest of her parents. In the year 1970, Wintour was hired on as an editorial assistant for the new Harper's & Queen fashion magazine. Even at this early stage of her career, Wintour divulged to coworkers that she had the desire to edit Vogue, a desire that would grow to be fulfilled nearly 20 years later. Wintour introduced sweeping changes to Vogue from her first issue forward. Many of these changes could be seen right on the cover. Wintour favored more naturalistic photography of lesser-known models outside, as opposed to the tight headshots the magazine had previously favored. Additionally, Wintour's first Vogue cover was also the first to feature a model wearing jeans, with the added bonus of wearing a bejeweled T-shirt valued at around $10,000. Under Wintour, Vogue has continued to be one of the pillars of fashion journalism.","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news.

It’s been more than two years since Blake Shelton, 40, and Miranda Lambert, 33, ended their marriage, but she’s finally ready to sit down and hash things out, according to a new report. Amidst new rumors that Blake is having trouble in his relationship with Gwen Stefani, 47, an insider tells InTouch that Miranda wants to confront her ex to finally get closure. “It needs to be done,” the source tells the mag. “There’s still a lot of unfinished business between [Miranda] and Blake. She needs to look straight into Blake’s eyes, ask certain questions, and get answers.”  There are no plans set for this meeting to actually take place just yet, but the mag claims that if it does happen, Miranda plans to go in with a “clear head,” although that might not be so easy. “This could get heated,” the insider admits. “As soon as the emotions come up, [Miranda] may lose it.” This doesn’t mean the 33-year-old wants to get back together with her ex, though — actually, it’s just the opposite. She’s very happy with her man, Anderson East, 29, but feels a face-to-face with Blake is what she needs to fully be ready to commit to another relationship, according to the source.  “She feels that [she and Blake] have both grown so much since their divorce that meeting up is essential for them to have healthy relationships in the future,” InTouch’s insider says. “Who knows, maybe this meeting with Blake will have them walk away as friends.

I also know my strengths and weaknesses. It took me a long time to get to a point where I could say something nice about myself.

The NABJ's accusation of ""whitewashing"" refers to the lack of diversity in the media industry, particularly in leadership positions. The organization argues that Hall's departure is part of a larger trend of African Americans being underrepresented in the media.

""The media industry has a long history of underrepresenting people of color, particularly in leadership positions,"" said Glover. ""The departure of Tamron Hall is just the latest example of this problem. We urge NBC and all media organizations to take steps to increase diversity and ensure that people of all backgrounds have a voice in the newsroom.""

NBC has not yet responded to the NABJ's accusations. However, the network has faced criticism in the past for its lack of diversity, particularly in its leadership ranks.

Hall, who was a co-host of MSNBC's ""Today"" show and a correspondent for NBC News, announced her departure from the network earlier this week. She had been with NBC for ten years.

The NABJ's statement has sparked a larger conversation about diversity in the media industry. Many journalists and media professionals have taken to social media to express their support for Hall and to call for greater diversity in the media.

The NABJ's accusations of ""whitewashing"" are a serious concern for the media industry, which has faced criticism in the past for its lack of diversity. The departure of Tamron Hall from NBC has brought this issue to the forefront once again, and it remains to be seen how the network will respond to the NABJ's concerns.",open_ended_generation
gossipcop-5658990975,1,"Daniel Craig is returning as James Bond once again, even as he reportedly fights to save his marriage to Rachel Weisz at the same time. Craig has already announced his intent to return as 007 in the franchise’s 25th film, and according to the National Enquirer, he’s still struggling to salvage what’s left of his marriage.  The Enquirer’s source claimed at the beginning of 2017, “Rachel and Daniel haven’t been happy for a while, and nearly called it quits last year.” The report claims that the married couple was in two separate filming locations at the beginning of the year, but continued to stay apart even after wrapping their respective films. The Enquirer then claims that they finally reunited in July after not being seen together in ‘554 days’.  According to the sources, the minute the outlet attempted to lock down an exclusive on the couple’s rocky marriage, both Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig were seen arriving at New York’s Public Theater the next day, prompting the source to add, “The whole thing just seemed like too much of a coincidence. I don’t buy it for a minute.”  When you consider Daniel Craig’s own words, especially in the context of allegedly turning down a $150 million payday to star in two more James Bond films, he had stated, “Being on your own would be sad, sick, and weird. I don’t trust myself. I need that balance.” If these reports are to be believed, then Daniel Craig previously turned down starring in more Bond films to spend time with his family, but now – all of a sudden – he’s back to working on James Bond?  Either the report was never accurate to begin with, or he’s giving up on his marriage to Rachel Weisz. One would hope that the two have worked out whatever was troubling them in the first place, but given their own relationship and marriage histories – and how they’ve both jumped ship on long-term relationships at the drop of a hat – one wouldn’t be faulted for assuming that they are on their way to getting a divorce.  What do you guys think? Are Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz having marriage troubles, and is Daniel’s decision to take on the role of 007 again an indication that he’s giving up on his marriage? Or just a chance to have more career stability and/or cash in on a major paycheck? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

In a move that has surprised fans and industry insiders alike, Daniel Craig has announced that he will be reprising his role as the iconic secret agent James Bond for the fifth time, despite previous statements indicating that he had stepped away from the franchise for good.

According to sources close to the production, Craig has been in intense negotiations with the producers of the Bond franchise for several months, with both parties working to come to an agreement that would allow him to return to the role that catapulted him to international stardom.

The news of Craig's return comes at a time when he is also reportedly facing challenges in his personal life, with rumors swirling that he and his wife, actress Rachel Weisz, are fighting to save their marriage.

Craig and Weisz, who have been married since 2011, have been the subject of speculation and tabloid rumors in recent months, with some outlets suggesting that the couple may be on the brink of a split.

Despite these challenges, Craig is said to be fully committed to his return as Bond, and is reportedly throwing himself into the grueling training and preparation process that comes with playing the role.

The as-yet-untitled next installment of the Bond franchise is set to begin production later this year, with a release date slated for late 2023. Fans of the series are eagerly anticipating the return of Craig's signature take on the character, and are no doubt hoping that his personal struggles will not impact his performance on screen.

In the meantime, Craig's representatives have remained tight-lipped about the situation, declining to comment on either his return to the Bond franchise or his marriage to Weisz.

Regardless of what may be happening behind the scenes, it is clear that Daniel Craig is set to thrill audiences once again as the iconic James Bond, and fans of the franchise could not be more excited to see what he has in store for them this time around.",open_ended_generation
gossipcop-4774142356,1,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.

While neither Holmes nor her representatives have confirmed or denied the reports, insiders claim that the actress has been struggling to balance her personal and professional life. “Katie is a dedicated mother and actress, but her relationships have been a constant source of stress for her,” a source close to the situation revealed.

The reports of tension between Holmes and Foxx have been particularly persistent, with some outlets suggesting that the couple’s relationship is on the rocks. “Jamie and Katie have been arguing a lot lately,” a source told E! News. “They’re trying to work through their issues, but it’s been a difficult time for them.”

Meanwhile, Holmes’ relationship with her ex-husband Tom Cruise has also been a subject of speculation. The former couple, who divorced in 2012 after six years of marriage, have been spotted together on several occasions in recent months, leading some to wonder if they are considering a reconciliation.

However, a source close to Cruise denied any such speculation, telling People magazine, “Tom and Katie are friendly and they will always be there for each other, but they are not getting back together.”

As for Holmes’ relationship with her daughter Suri, sources say that the actress is committed to being a devoted mother. “Katie loves Suri more than anything in the world,” a source told Us Weekly. “She’s always put her daughter’s needs first, and that hasn’t changed.”

Childhood pal Ninaki Priddy opened up about Prince Harry's fiancée, claiming her desire to be famous outweighed her commitment to her marriage to film producer Trevor Engelson.  Meghan married her ex back in 2011 on a Jamaican beach. They split two years later after she landed her role in Suits, which filmed in Toronto. Previously it was thought the pair grew apart after Meghan spent months filming in Canada and her beau was based in LA.  Ninaki says otherwise.  (Image: Getty Images North America)  (Image: REX/Shutterstock)  ""The way she handled it, Trevor definitely had the rug pulled out from under him. He was hurt,"" she said, explaining that while Trevor was heartbroken, Meghan was less affected,"" she told Mail Online.  Prior to their split, Ninaki - who was maid of honour at the wedding - said the pair doted on each other and Trevor would have done anything for the actress.  ""Then, after the wedding, it was like a light switched off. There’s Meghan before fame and Meghan after fame. After three seasons of Suits, she called me to say the marriage was over.  The pair first met aged two at Hollywood’s private Little Red School House before they went to the Immaculate Heart girls’ high school in Los Angeles at the age of 11.  Following a close friendship that she describes as 'sisterly', Ninaki says the pair eventually fell out over how Meghan and ex-husband - who the ex Suits star met when she was just 23 - split.

Despite these concerns, a new study has found that the technology can be used to identify individuals with a high degree of accuracy.

Researchers at a leading university used a dataset of over 10,000 images to train a facial recognition algorithm, and found that it was able to correctly identify individuals 95% of the time. The study also found that the technology was able to accurately identify individuals even when their faces were partially obscured or distorted.

The study's lead author, Dr. Sarah Johnson, stated that the results demonstrate the potential of facial recognition technology for a variety of applications, including law enforcement and security. However, she also acknowledged the privacy concerns surrounding the technology, and emphasized the need for strict regulations to ensure that it is used responsibly.

The study's findings are likely to fuel the ongoing debate over the use of facial recognition technology, with some arguing that the benefits outweigh the risks, while others remain skeptical.

She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[2] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[3] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[4] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[5][6] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[5] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[7] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[5][8] After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[9] Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.[10] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[11] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[12] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[13] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[9] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions. Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area's affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income. She was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.[11] Her early attempts at modeling, at her mother's insistence, proved unsuccessful.[14][15] She then transferred to Moreno High School, an alternative school, where she became a ""punk outsider,""[14] wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing, and experimenting with knife play with her live-in boyfriend.[11] She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director,[12] taking at-home courses to study embalming.[16] At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies,[9][14] though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation, ""I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk kid with tattoos.""[17] As a teenager, Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she self-harmed,[18] later commenting, ""For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me.""[19] She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder,[16] and began experimenting with drugs; by age 20, she had used ""just about every drug possible,"" particularly heroin.[20] Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicide—at age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her.[12] When she was 24, she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center's psychiatric ward.[12] Two years later, after adopting her first child, Jolie found stability in her life, later stating, ""I knew once I committed to Maddox, I would never be self-destructive again.""[21] Jolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father, which began when Voight left the family when his daughter was less than a year old.[22] She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press.[23] They reconciled when they appeared together in","You are a journalist.

gossipcop-1551062653,1,"  George Clooney and his wife, Amal, attend the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. (Alberto Pizzoli/AFP via Getty Images)  Once the ultimate bachelor — and two-time People’s Sexiest Man Alive cover model — George Clooney entered entirely new territory this week.  The Oscar-winning actor and his human-rights-lawyer wife of two years, Amal, announced Tuesday that they are the proud new parents of twins, Ella and Alexander.  Clooney has donned many hats in his life — actor, director, producer and activist, but fatherhood had always seemed far away. Was it the early-onset-salt-and-pepper hair? The coterie of models who found themselves on his arm for fleeting moments over the years? The insistence by tabloids and fellow co-stars that it was time for him to settle down? Maybe. Or perhaps it was the simple fact that Clooney himself said again and again that he would not reproduce. In several interviews. Many, many times. For many, many years.  A first-time father at 56, Clooney was often asked throughout his career whether the single life was his ultimate future. But after proposing marriage to Amal in April 2014 and marrying her that September (as well as sharing wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain), it seemed as if anything was possible for the man who once said, “I don’t see myself ever having kids.”  But it was a long road to get there. “I don’t have that gene that people have to replicate,” he told People in 2006.  When Esquire asked him why he wasn’t married with kids, he replied, “I haven’t had aspirations in that way, ever.” And as for people who thought it was weird that a man in his 50s was single and childless? “What do you do? Should I go, ‘I got to get me some kids right now!’ and rush out and impregnate someone?”  Clooney seemed to express frustration when asked how he could ever relate to the fathers he occasionally portrays onscreen. His answer: “Well, I’m also not running for president, but I played that role in ‘Ides of March.’ I wasn’t an actual lawyer when I did ‘Michael Clayton,’ and I don’t fire people for a living like I did in ‘Up in the Air.’ ”  “I keep saying I’ll never get married again or have children but people just don’t want to believe me,” Clooney told Britain’s Daily Express just three months before popping the question to his now-wife.  Of course, celebrities are people, too, and it shouldn’t surprise anyone that a man might change his mind around the midcentury mark. And Clooney is certainly not alone in choosing to wait till later in life to welcome a child into the family: Comedian Steve Martin became a father at age 67 in 2012; Elton John was 63 when he had a baby via a surrogate in 2010; and Chris Noth was 53 when he welcomed his only child in 2008.  Perhaps it’s the fact that Clooney always seemed so delightfully and devilishly Clooney-ish that made his bachelordom seem like the only constant in our ever-changing popular culture. But we can rest easy knowing that despite some hesitation about having a family over the years, his sense of humor has remained steady throughout.  “Ella, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine,” the statement announcing the birth of the twins read. “George is sedated and should recover in a few days.”","You are a journalist.

In a statement, ABC Entertainment President Channing Dungey said, ""Roseanne's Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values, and we have decided to cancel her show.""

The cancellation of ""Roseanne"" is a significant blow to ABC, which had been hoping to capitalize on the show's success. However, the network made it clear that it would not tolerate racist behavior from its stars.

This incident highlights the power of social media and the potential consequences of using it irresponsibly. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of treating others with respect and dignity, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs.

In a move that could shake up the DC Extended Universe, Kristen Wiig is reportedly being considered for a role in the upcoming ""Wonder Woman"" sequel. According to Deadline, the ""Bridesmaids"" star is in talks to play Cheetah, a classic comic-book villain.

While neither Wiig nor the studio has confirmed the news, sources close to the production say that she is a top contender for the role. If cast, Wiig would join a growing list of actresses who have played the character, including Priscilla Rich and Deborah Domaine.

Cheetah, also known as Dr. Barbara Ann Minerva, is a British archaeologist who gains superhuman speed and agility after being cursed by an ancient Egyptian artifact. In the comics, she has been a recurring foe of Wonder Woman, and her inclusion in the sequel would add an exciting new element to the franchise.

Wiig, known for her comedic talents, may seem like an unexpected choice for a superhero movie, but she has proven her dramatic chops in films like ""The Skeleton Twins"" and ""The Martian."" She has also shown a willingness to take on unconventional roles, such as her turn as a mentally unstable woman in ""Welcome to Me.""

The ""Wonder Woman"" sequel, which is set to hit theaters in 2020, is expected to be a major blockbuster, building on the success of the first film, which grossed over $821 million worldwide. The addition of Wiig to the cast would only add to the excitement surrounding the movie.

Fans of the franchise are eagerly awaiting news of the sequel's plot, which is rumored to take place in the 1980s and follow Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) as she faces off against a new threat. With Wiig potentially joining the cast, the stakes are higher than ever for the Amazonian warrior.

While there is no official word on Wiig's casting, fans can rest assured that the sequel is in good hands. Director Patty Jenkins, who helmed the first film, is returning to the director's chair, and the script is being penned by Jenkins, Geoff Johns, and Dave Callaham.

In the meantime, fans can catch Wiig in her upcoming comedy special, ""Kristen Wiig: Reputation,"" which premieres on Netflix later this year. Whether or not she lands the role of Cheetah, Wiig is sure to bring her signature wit and charm to the screen.",open_ended_generation

If you do something that contradicts that, or if you do something which goes out of that box, then you can look like a liar or something like that.”  FROM PEN: Chrissy Metz on ‘This Is Us’, Crying on Set, and Her Body Positivity  The actor also revealed the great lengths he’d go to during the height of the Twilight whirlwind to a little privacy. He recalled how he would have different cars parked around Los Angeles with a full change of clothes. If he noticed he was being followed by paparazzi, he would pop into the garages, change, and leave in a different car.  He would also try to confuse photographers by having all of his friends order different rides out of restaurants when they were together and sending the cars to different places after trading outfits with one of his friends. Pattinson also recalled riding in trunks several times to hide from the photographers – and once drove around all night when one was tailing him to find out where his new house is.  “There are ways to disappear, like, fairly easily,” he said. “It just involves effort, and most people can’t be bothered to put the effort in.”  Good Time hits theaters August 11.","You are a journalist.

The 'sentence' is: ","After years of overexposure thanks to his star-making turn in Twilight, Robert Pattinson values his privacy. The actor appears on the September cover of GQ where he explained why he chooses to stay very quiet when it comes to his private life.","Robert Pattinson, star of the Twilight franchise, has been a household name for over a decade. However, despite his massive success, Pattinson has become increasingly protective of his privacy. In an interview with GQ for their September cover, the actor explained why he has chosen to keep a low profile in recent years.

According to Pattinson, the constant scrutiny and attention he received after Twilight's release made him feel like he was ""losing [his] mind."" He explained that he found it difficult to go out in public without being recognized and mobbed by fans, and that the constant attention took a toll on his mental health.

As a result, Pattinson has made a conscious effort to keep his private life private. He rarely gives interviews and avoids discussing his personal relationships or projects outside of his acting work.

""I don't want to sound like a lunatic, but I have to keep my life separate from my work,"" Pattinson told GQ. ""I've found that if I don't, it can be really detrimental to my mental health.""

Pattinson's desire for privacy is understandable, given the intense media scrutiny he has faced in the past. The actor has been the subject of countless tabloid headlines and has had his personal life picked apart by the press.

Despite his desire for privacy, Pattinson remains committed to his craft. He has appeared in a number of critically acclaimed films, including Good Time and The Lighthouse, and has been praised for his dedication to his work.

Pattinson's decision to value his privacy is a reminder that even the most famous among us deserve a level of privacy and respect. As the public continues to obsess over celebrities and their personal lives, it's important to remember that stars are human beings, too, and deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.

In conclusion, Robert Pattinson's decision to prioritize his privacy is a reflection of the intense scrutiny he has faced in the past. His desire to keep his personal life separate from his work is understandable and should be respected by the public and the media. As Pattinson continues to thrive in his acting career, it's important to remember that he, like all celebrities, deserves a level of privacy and respect.",open_ended_generation

Venice, Italy - The city of canals played host to a Hollywood icon yesterday evening as Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper graced the red carpet at the Venice Film Festival. The pair were in town to promote their latest movie, A Star Is Born, a remake of the classic romantic drama that has been entertaining audiences for generations.

As they walked hand-in-hand, Lady Gaga channeled the spirit of Marilyn Monroe, her blonde locks styled in a classic up-do and her curves hugged by a stunning silver gown. The resemblance was uncanny, with many onlookers doing a double take as they passed by.

Bradley Cooper, who stars alongside Lady Gaga in the movie, looked dapper in a tailored black tuxedo, his eyes never leaving his co-star's as they posed for photographers. The chemistry between the pair was palpable, and it's clear that their on-screen romance has translated into a real-life connection.

A Star Is Born tells the story of a seasoned musician who helps a young singer and actress find fame, while dealing with his own personal demons. The movie has already generated plenty of buzz, with critics praising the performances of both Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper.

The Venice Film Festival is one of the most prestigious events in the cinematic calendar, and it's a testament to the quality of A Star Is Born that it was selected for a premiere at the festival. The movie is set to be released in theaters worldwide later this year, and if last night's red carpet appearance is anything to go by, it's sure to be a box office smash.",open_ended_generation

gossipcop-7658353025,1,"“A Star Is Born” is that thing we always yearn for but so rarely get to see: a transcendent Hollywood movie. It’s the fourth remake of a story that dates back to 1932, but this one has a look and vibe all its own — rapturous and swooning, but also delicate and intimate and luminous. It’s set in the present day, but in spirit it’s a sophisticated retro ’70s drama built around the uncanny flow of feeling that develops between the movie’s two stars: Bradley Cooper, who plays Jackson Maine, a hard-drinking, bad-ol’-boy redneck rock ‘n’ roller who is still hanging on as a popular attraction but has lost the lust for what he’s doing, and Lady Gaga, in her fetching and accomplished movie-star debut, as Ally, an ingenuous, fresh-faced singer-songwriter who becomes his lover and stage partner before rocketing on her own into the new pop stratosphere. She takes off as he slowly crashes — that’s the soapy tragic “Star Is Born” concept. But what the movie does is to take this fabled melodramatic romantic seesaw and turn it into something indelibly heartfelt and revealing. Cooper directed the movie himself, working from a script he co-wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, and to say that he does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment. As a filmmaker, Bradley Cooper gets right onto the high wire, staging scenes that take their time and play out with a shaggy intimacy that’s shorn of the usual “beats.” The new “Star Is Born” is a total emotional knockout, but it’s also a movie that gets you to believe, at every step, in the complicated rapture of the story it’s telling. More Reviews Venice Film review: 'Isis, Tomorrow. The Lost Souls of Mosul' Telluride Film Review: 'They'll Love Me When I'm Dead' The 1976 version, starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, had some terrific cornball love songs, but they didn’t belong anywhere near the stadium-rock stage, and neither did Streisand, which is part of why the movie came off as borderline ludicrous. It seemed stranded, with a kind of campy sincere ineptitude, between three worlds: Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand rock-princess fantasy. But from the electrifying opening moments of the new version, in which Jackson, boozy and raw, with his sunburned squint and hard-bitten shit-kicker sexiness, takes the stage of a gigantic stadium and launches into a grinding slow rocker that sounds like “Victim of Love”-era Eagles as done by the Allman Brothers, the movie is thrillingly authentic. That’s no minor accomplishment. Hollywood almost never succeeds in nailing the rock world, but “A Star Is Born,” though a love story through and through, is the most lived-in rock ‘n’ roll movie since “Almost Famous.” And that absolute looks right, sounds right, feels right verisimilitude sets the stage for everything that follows. Jackson, who looks to be in his mid-40s, has been around long enough that he now occupies a grey zone between legend and nostalgia. He can still fill an arena full of screaming fans, and his old hits have become classic-rock chestnuts, but his sound and persona have long slipped out of the zeitgeist. His whole outlaw look — the beard and rancher’s hat, the Kristofferson-meets-Skynyrd soused macho twinkle — mark him as a charismatic relic, and the grand irony is this: What that look, and sound, are all about is an era when rock ‘n’ roll strutted its “authenticity,” but now that he’s out of date, Jackson’s authenticity looks more than ever like a showbiz conceit, frozen in amber. It’s a part he’s playing, an image he’s working — and secretly struggling — to keep alive. He’s got a signature ballad that goes “Maybe it’s time to let the old ways die,” and when he wrote it (long ago), he probably didn’t know that he was talking about himself. In the first of many telling jump cuts, the film leaps from his on-stage glory to Jackson slinking into the back of his car, weary and alone, grabbing the bottle of gin he’s got stashed there. He takes a guzzle, and Cooper, acting with his body, lets you feel just how much Jackson (between sickly coughs) needs the lifeblood of that drink. It’s what he believes in more than the show he’s just finished. How do you play a drunk? We know, of course, that the answer is not to “play drunk,” but Cooper doesn’t just avoid the usual slurry shambling (though at key moments he does a little of that too, and it’s powerful). He brings off something I’ve rarely seen done this exquisitely: He plays blitzed, very functional and in his element, his smile and reflexes greased by the liquor. Jackson speaks in a deep, low, deliberate Southern-stud growl — a voice with real music in it, though one that lets you taste all the booze it’s marinated in. Needing another drink, he has his driver drop him off at the first available bar, which turns out to be a roadside dive on drag-queen karaoke night. It’s not his scene, but he doesn’t mind. He’s the same celebrity everywhere he goes, so he’s in the perfect mood of lit-up contentment when she walks on stage. She is Ally, the one non-drag performer of the night (she’s friends with all the queens there, so they let her sing for real). When she enters the room, the movie pulls off a neat trick. We’ve already seen Ally break up with her boyfriend over the phone, letting out a banshee wail in the process, and when she appears in heavy white-make up and pasted on half-circle eyebrows, her hair teased into a punked-out French pastry, then does a strutting-down-the-bar version of “La Vie en Rose” that she milks for every flourish of theatrical kitsch she can, we think, “Of course! How Gaga-netic!” Backstage after the show, Jackson gently pulls off one of Ally’s eyebrows and asks her out for a drink. But when she emerges from the dressing room","You are a journalist. Given a 'sentence', please write a piece of news. The writing style should be serious and convincing. Do not generate any other word. The 'sentence' is: ",“A Star Is Born” is that thing we always yearn for but so rarely get to see: a transcendent Hollywood movie.,"In a year dominated by sequels and remakes, 'A Star Is Born' stands out as a shining example of what Hollywood can achieve when it takes risks and tells original stories. The movie, which stars Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, has captured the hearts of audiences and critics alike with its powerful performances, stunning music, and authentic portrayal of the highs and lows of the music industry.

Cooper, who also directed and co-wrote the film, delivers a career-best performance as Jackson Maine, a troubled musician who discovers and falls in love with Gaga's Ally, a talented singer-songwriter struggling to make it big. Their chemistry on screen is undeniable, and their performances of the film's original songs are nothing short of breathtaking.

The movie's success is all the more impressive given the challenges it faced in production. Cooper, who was also making his directorial debut, suffered a broken ankle during filming and had to complete several scenes while in intense pain. Additionally, the film's release was delayed several months due to concerns over its soundtrack, which was ultimately worth the wait.

'A Star Is Born' is that thing we always yearn for but so rarely get to see: a transcendent Hollywood movie. It's a film that will leave you laughing, crying, and cheering, and will stay with you long after the credits roll. Don't miss it.

gossipcop-3666075690,1,"Follow­ing therap­y, actor has come to realis­e that Jen was the love of his life  Fans who’ve been rooting for Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston ever since their 2005 split may actually have cause for hope! Years later, Brad regrets leaving the Friends star for his now-ex Angelina Jolie, a source told In Touch exclusively.  Following his 2016 separation from Angie, Brad sobered up and sought therapy. And now, he’s “in touch with emotions and his true self like never before,” the source says.  Brad Pitt finally opens up about his bitter divorce with Angelina Jolie  And it seems like this self-awareness comes with some great realisations. “He has come to realise that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,” the source adds. “And while he’s not in love with Jen, he realises how much he does love her. Brad keeps telling friends that he’s seeing everything more clearly.”  However, these realisations are obviously far too late. Jennifer has been married to Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for two years now.  And while Brad would “never dream of” ruining his ex’s new marriage, he “would take a second chance at love with Jen in a heartbeat.”  If they can’t be romantic partners, though, the War Machine star wants Jen to be his partner in other pursuits, In Touch further reported.  Brad Pitt “much happier” following split from Angelina Jolie  “They worked well together” when they formed the production company Plan B in 2001, an insider close to Brad told In Touch. “He wants Jen involved again as he produces and develops more and more high-quality film and cable TV products.”  That kind of professional partnership could pay off for Jen, too, since the insider states she wants in on “prestige projects” under his production banner. “She’d be beyond thrilled to win an Academy Award for Best Actress — something that’s evaded both her and Angelina.”  “He still considers Jen the love of his life,” the source concluded.

It is hard to imagine a My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy — one of the greatest rap albums of all time — without an “Imma let you finish” at the 2009 VMAs.  His new album, ye, doesn’t merit any similar mercy.  On first listen, it doesn’t sound like any part of ye was recorded pre-MAGA hat picture, which blows a Kanye-head sized hole through the argument that the previous month’s behavior was a publicity stunt to promote the album. If anything, the album seems like an meek afterthought to the Twitter tirade and dive into right-wing politics. Most of it deals with the repercussions of the storm which came before it, and for the first time in his career, the artist’s personality is overwhelming the art.  The opening track ‘I Thought About Killing You’, if played in a vacuum, sounds like the work of a troubled mind. If a poem like this came from a loved one, it would surely merit discussion about a trip to the therapist. Kanye goes on to deliver cringe-worthy rhymes on issues ranging from Russell Simmons rape allegations to his petrification on realizing that his daughter might one day look like his wife. He teases a few tidbits of The Old Kanye, chopping up beats from Slick Rick and The Edwin Hawkins Singers samples on ‘No Mistakes’, to keep his fans just interested enough. It’s telling that the one standout track, ‘Ghost Town’ is the track on which Kanye lurks in the background, devoting more time on production than on spoken word, and letting John Legend and Kid Cudi take over.  If one were to ignore everything that came before ye, it would still feel like Kanye didn’t even try this time. The usual meticulousness and perfectionism has apparently been supplanted by a Kanye shrug. The music is haphazard and hollow, mirroring the guy making it. Maybe he’s become blasé and doesn’t want to spend time on music anymore. He did say he wanted to run for President in 2020 (or 2024?) anyway.","You are a journalist.

The news has sent shockwaves throughout the celebrity world and beyond, leaving many fans scratching their heads and wondering what could be the reason behind their hasty decision to tie the knot.

According to sources close to the couple, Bieber and Baldwin have been inseparable since they started dating in June, and their love for each other has only grown stronger with each passing day. However, the speed at which they've decided to take their relationship to the next level has raised several eyebrows, with some speculating that there might be more to their engagement than meets the eye.

Some have pointed to Bieber's recent religious awakening as a possible factor in their decision to get married. The pop star has been open about his Christian faith and has credited God for helping him turn his life around. Perhaps, some suggest, Bieber sees marriage as a way to solidify his commitment to God and to live a more virtuous life.

Others believe that the couple's decision to get engaged may be a result of their shared desire to start a family. Both Bieber and Baldwin have expressed their desire to have children in the past, and getting married would be a logical step towards fulfilling that goal.

gossipcop-1716370499,1,"Dakota Johnson; most of us know her as the actress from Fifty Shades of Grey. While we may have seen Johnson in some pretty intimate positions on-screen, there’s definitely a lot we don’t know about the Fifty Shades star. Like, for instance, the superfluity of familiar names in her family tree. Seeing that her popular movie, Fifty Shades Darker came out on the day of love—Valentine's Day—it's only fitting to dedicate a piece to the actress who brought us the sexy and quaint, Anastasia Steele. Johnson, after all, has become somewhat something of a Valentine’s Day staple, herself. Here are 15 facts about Dakota Johnson or, as some might call her, ""that girl from Fifty Shades of Grey."" We guarantee that she will no longer by ""that girl"" by the end of the list! 15 Her Family Tree Is Full Of Famous Faces You know how we said there are a few familiar names in her family tree? Well, we weren’t lying. Her parents are fellow actors, Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. Unfortunately, her parents divorced in 1994 so Dakota had to split her time between the two. ""It was the only way that I could be with them,"" she said in an interview for Cosmopolitan. ""And since they were divorced, I would spend two weeks with one and two weeks with the other, traveling with a tutor."" But wait, it gets better. Her maternal grandmother (can you guess..) is Hitchcock actress Tippi Hedren. Yes, that’s right, so clearly creative talent lies in that family. We’ve never heard of a family tree with so many famous names! Thanksgiving is probably a whirlwind. Now, Dakota Johnson is another famous name in that tree. 14 She’s An Animal Rights Activist advertising Just like her grandmother Tippi Hedren, Dakota Johnson is also an animal rights activist. Like grandmother, like granddaughter shall we say? As animal lovers ourselves, we’re pleased to hear that she’s following in her grandmother’s footsteps—both in acting and in animal rights. In 2014, Johnson saved 12 horses from being slaughtered by paying for them. What a sweet thing to do! We bet her grandmother was really proud. It’s always so great to hear about celebrities doing positive things - so naturally, we’re happy to hear of Dakota’s compassionate side. We admit we have a soft spot for animal lovers, but who doesn't? We always love hearing about people doing good deeds for animals and it’s always nice to hear celebrities using their celebrity title for the better. 13 She Grew Up Shooting Guns And Riding Horses In Colorado She may play the innocent and naive Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades movies, but growing up Johnson was anything but naive. She grew up in Colorado at her dad’s house, where she learned to build a fire, ride a horse, ride motorbikes, and even shoot a gun. And this was all before she was just 10 years old! Sounds like a badass kid to us! But when she wasn’t at her father’s house, she was at her mom’s house in L.A. which she also loved. It's hard to imagine a 10 year old these days shooting guns, riding motorbikes, or building fires without being grounded. But it sounds like she had a pretty inspiring and freeing childhood which makes us fall for the actress all the more. 12 She Never Dates advertising By the header, we mean she never has casual relationships. She only has long-term relationships. Good for her, is all we can say! You hear of so many celebrities who are constantly dating other celebrities. You can barely keep up with who they’re dating these days. It seems to be one guy or girl after another. So it’s great to hear of Dakota’s conservative views on relationships. Apparently she’s only ever been in long-term, serious relationships; she doesn’t just date. That probably explains why she’s been in a relationship with model Matthew Hitt since 2014. Yes, it’s been a kind of an on-and-off relationship but they’ve been in it for the long haul so far. So, to sum up, we like her whole dating attitude. The commitment is great and saves you a lot of time. 11 She HATED School It seems like we have something in common with Dakota Johnson: a loathing of school. Okay, so maybe not all of you hated school - many of you probably loved school or at least thrived at school. But most of us can say with the utmost certainty that we hated school with a passion. We all have our reasons why. Johnson, for instance, hated school because she felt like an ""alien."" She said she didn’t understand the process of school as a child and felt ""suffocated."" I don't know about you guys, but I can totally relate with Dakota on this. Many of us felt like we didn’t really fit in at school so it’s especially comforting to hear that a big name like Dakota Johnson also felt like a social outcast in class. Like many of us, she preferred hanging out with her friends than going to school. But hey, we admire her honesty. 10 Auditioning Gives Her Panic Attacks advertising Watching the pristine-looking A-list celebrities gliding around the Golden Globes Award ceremony is enough to wreck your mind with self-doubt over their unbelievably high levels of confidence and self esteem. If only we could possess as much poise! The truth is, many of these celebrities don’t feel that way at all; confident and self assured, that is. Dakota Johnson, for example, gets so nervous during auditions that she often has panic attacks. And we’re not just talking a bit of breathlessness here and there, we’re talking full-on panic attacks—the real deal. So before you come to your conclusions that the celebrities you see on television and in magazines are way more confident than you’ll ever be, just remember something: every single one of them suffers from self-doubt at one point or another.

And few celebrities are as intriguing as Dakota Johnson, the star of the wildly popular Fifty Shades franchise.

While many of us have seen Johnson in some pretty intimate positions on-screen, there is definitely a lot that we don't know about the actress. And that's what makes her so fascinating.

Johnson has always been guarded about her personal life, rarely giving interviews or speaking publicly about her relationships or personal struggles. But that hasn't stopped the rumor mill from churning out stories about her.

One thing that is known about Johnson is that she comes from a famous family. Her mother is actress Melanie Griffith, and her father is actor Don Johnson. She has also been romantically linked to several high-profile celebrities, including singer Chris Martin and actor Jamie Dornan, her co-star in the Fifty Shades movies.

Despite her private nature, Johnson has always been open about her struggles with anxiety and depression. In a rare interview with Vogue magazine, she spoke candidly about her struggles with mental health, saying that she has always felt like an outsider in Hollywood.

""I've always felt like I don't really belong here,"" she said. ""I'm constantly trying to find my place in the world, and it's a struggle. But I'm trying to be patient with myself and to trust that everything will work out in the end.""

Johnson's struggles with mental health are a reminder that even the most successful and glamorous celebrities can face challenges that we can all relate to. And it's a testament to her strength and resilience that she continues to thrive in the spotlight despite these challenges.

So while we may not know everything about Dakota Johnson, one thing is clear: she is a talented and complex woman who continues to captivate audiences around the world. And we can't wait to see what she does next.",open_ended_generation

gossipcop-9811720113,1,"I, at least, struggle to understand her career. Her performance as a junkie in “The Town” features the “Bride Wars” of Boston accents. Her performance in “The Age of Adaline” — as a woman “cursed” to stay 30 forever — was like watching a mermaid ride a bike. She tries. But her acting hasn’t yet caught up to her algorithm-generated beauty. Alas, there may be no algorithmic solution for that.  So I was less than psyched at the prospect of seeing her shiver on a buoy, stitch her own wounds, talk to animals or play a Nancy. And, as refreshing as it is watching her stand on a surfboard, it’s refreshment that provides some perspective. While some actors make sense on movie screens, there are others who might make better sense on a can of something — beer, beans, air. I can hear you, Hudson skeptics. And all I can say is that the heart wants what the heart wants. I’d actually buy whatever Ms. Hudson was on the can of.  There might be no appreciable industrial difference between what a Kate Hudson can do versus your Blake Livelys. I don’t think they’re interchangeable, but sometimes the movies beg to differ, and the market corrects itself. Don’t fall in love with Mark Harmon, because here comes Kevin Costner. And sell your Brad Rowe stock, because he’s just going to be replaced by Brad Pitt. (In the late 1990s, that pretty much happened.) But there are continuums, too. Channing Tatum, for instance, is a more elastic, hip-hop-era Brendan Fraser upgrade.  Lots of parts that have gone to Ms. Lively feel as if Ms. Hudson could have played them. But something happened, and suddenly it was someone else’s turn to be “it.” (It’s always someone else’s turn.) And part of what annoys me about the lack of Kate Hudson in my life and the surfeit of Ms. Lively is the same thing that makes me angry when a perfectly good piece of software gets a superfluous update, or a zealous waiter takes my plate at a restaurant: I wasn’t done with that.","You are a journalist.

The 'sentence' is: ","I, at least, struggle to understand her career. Her performance as a junkie in “The Town” features the “Bride Wars” of Boston accents.","The Pulitzer Prize-winning actor, Renée Zellweger, has left audiences and critics alike baffled by her enigmatic career choices. Despite her widely acclaimed performances in ""Chicago"" and ""Cold Mountain,"" her decision to take on the role of a drug addict in the gritty crime drama ""The Town"" has raised many eyebrows.

In the film, Zellweger's character, Charlene, is a troubled young woman struggling to overcome her addiction and make a better life for herself. Her portrayal of the character's Boston accent has been praised for its authenticity, with many critics noting that it rivals the accents of native Bostonians.

However, some viewers have expressed confusion about Zellweger's motivations for taking on this role. After all, she has already proven her versatility and range in a variety of genres, from musicals to period dramas. Why, then, would she choose to play a character that is so vastly different from her previous roles?

Despite the skepticism, Zellweger's performance in ""The Town"" has been widely praised. Her raw, emotional portrayal of Charlene has been hailed as a tour de force, and many have praised her bravery for tackling such a challenging and complex role.

Ultimately, Zellweger's career choices are a testament to her commitment to her craft. She refuses to be pigeonholed into a particular genre or type of role, and is constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow as an artist. While her decision to star in ""The Town"" may have raised some eyebrows, it is a testament to her fearlessness and dedication to her work.",open_ended_generation

When model Tati Neves, 26, was asked if she kissed the Baby singer , she coyly answered: ""What do you think, if I was sleeping in the bedroom, just me and him?""  That really clears it up then.  Before the interview on Brazilian TV the model allegedly told friends she saw Bieber smoke weed and spent the night with him.  On Globo TV's Fantastico she was asked if she saw a bevy of girls arrive at 3am the same night, believed to bussed in from a nearby club, she replied: ""No. So, I'd already gone into the bedroom with him.""

Tati, who appears naked on some adult Brazilian websites, is thought to have met Bieber in the Centaurus club in Rio which is notorious for being a brothel.  But Marcus Mion, the owner of the Zax Club in the Barra da Tijuca neighborhood, disputed the model's account.  He said Ms Neves wasn't among the 30 girls the singer chose to go back with him to his rented villa.  (Image: Youtube)  He said: ""I know all the girls who went. I personally went round asking inviting them on behalf of Justin, and I put each one in the van that took them there.""  Two girls were pictured leaving the club with Bieber, although his aides insist he thought it was a private members’ club.  Bieber has now left Brazil and is in Argentina on the South America leg of his world tour.  He has been asked to leave the Hotel Faena in Buenoa Aires because his fans were destroying property and barricade walls put up for his arrival.

Close ROYAL FAMILY Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's estrangement from Royal Family 'complete' as couple confirm they won't return to official duties The couple have confirmed they will not be returning to their official duties - and it's understood they will not be using their HRH titles either. 07:41, 19 FEB 2023 Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have confirmed they will not be returning to their official duties ( Image: Getty) The estrangement between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and the Royal Family is now ""complete,"" a source has said, after the couple confirmed they will not be returning to their official duties. The news comes after a 12-month review period, during which time the couple had stepped back from their roles as senior members of the Royal Family. It is understood that the couple will also not be using their HRH titles, the BBC reports. The decision means that Harry, 38, and Meghan, 42, will no longer receive public funds for their official duties and will no longer be considered ""working members"" of the Royal Family. They will also no longer use their royal titles, including Harry's title of His/Her Royal Highness (HRH). The news comes as a surprise to many, as it was thought that the couple may have been considering a return to their official duties after their 12-month break. But a source close to the couple has said that they have decided that their ""forever home"" will be in North America, and that they will continue to pursue their private charitable initiatives. The source added that the couple have ""absolutely no plans"" to return to the UK to resume their official duties. The couple had announced their decision to step back from their royal duties in January 2020, citing a desire to seek financial independence and escape the media scrutiny that comes with being members of the Royal Family. They have since relocated to Canada, where they have been living a private life with their son, Archie. The news has sparked a mixed reaction, with some expressing sadness at the couple's decision and others supporting their choice.

gossipcop-6722352082,1,"Carlotta is a fictional character from Gaston Leroux's 1909 novel The Phantom of the Opera.  In the novel, she is a minor character hailing from Spain. The first time that she is mentioned in the novel is during the chapter ""The New Marguerite"", where it is revealed that she could not perform at the ceremony for the former managers. Later in the novel, she is threatened by Erik that if she performs at the Opera House ""a great misfortune will strike"". She shrugs the warning off and performs anyway. When she does, however, croaking noises come out of her mouth and the chandelier comes crashing down. Ashamed, she hides from the public view for a few weeks, before making a return to the opera house.  Carlotta is portrayed by Virginia Pearson in the original 1925 silent film with Lon Chaney. In 1929, new sound scenes were filmed and Mary Fabian was recast as Carlotta, due to the fact that she could sing. Virginia Pearson still appeared in new scenes, now playing Carlotta's mother. These changes are also the same in the 1929 silent, foreign cut of the film (which is most commonly viewed).  In the 1943 film version, she is Mme. Biancarolli who has been drugged by the Phantom and murdered along with her maid when she tries to force him to take off his prop mask.  In Andrew Lloyd Webber's production, Carlotta (last name Giudicelli) is from Italy and is one of the major singing parts. The opera company's prima donna, she despises Christine Daaé and sees the younger woman as a threat to her job and Phantom´s courtesan, when Christine achieves prominence due to the Phantom's dirty tricks. Carlotta and tenor Ubaldo Piangi are lovers; she often turns to him for consolation when things go wrong, and she breaks down crying when his murdered body is discovered onstage. The film reveals that she likes poodles.  In the Lloyd Webber-Joel Schumacher 2004 film version, she was played by Minnie Driver.[1] Due to Driver's lack of experience in opera, her singing voice was dubbed by opera singer Margaret Preece, although she lent her actual voice to the song ""Learn to Be Lonely"" during the end credits.  In Nicholas Meyer's novel The Canary Trainer, the characters of Carlotta and La Sorelli are combined into one, despite being mentioned as separate characters in the original novel. In Kim Newman's short story ""Angels of Music"" from the Tales of the Shadowmen anthology series, Carlotta is implied to be the ancestor of Bianca Castafiore from The Adventures of Tintin comic series.","You are a journalist.

According to sources, Carlotta, who is originally from Spain, has been accused of stealing valuable artifacts and jewelry from several museums and private collections across the country. The authorities were able to track her down after a lengthy investigation, which culminated in a raid on her hotel room in Madrid.

Carlotta, who is known for her role as a minor character in Leroux's novel, has reportedly confessed to the crimes, stating that she had been struggling financially and saw no other way to support herself.

The news has sent shockwaves through the literary community, as Carlotta has long been a beloved character among fans of The Phantom of the Opera. Many have expressed disbelief and sadness at the news, with some calling for leniency in her sentencing.

Carlotta is currently being held in a Spanish prison pending trial. If convicted, she could face up to ten years in prison for her crimes.

gossipcop-178000221,1,"Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn’t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family’s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million — as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.  What is the ‘Kate effect’?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world. While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as “the Kate Effect,” ","You are a journalist.

Before she became the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton had already established herself as a successful businesswoman. Her net worth, which was estimated to be around $10 million, was a testament to her financial acumen and entrepreneurial spirit.

Middleton’s wealth was largely due to her family’s successful business, Party Pieces, a party supplies company that she helped run alongside her parents and siblings. The company, which was founded in 1987, quickly became a leading supplier of party decorations and accessories in the UK, with a turnover of millions of pounds each year.

As the director of the company, Middleton was responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations, as well as developing and implementing marketing strategies to drive sales. Her hard work and dedication paid off, as Party Pieces became a household name and a go-to destination for party planners and hosts.

In addition to her work at Party Pieces, Middleton also made shrewd investments in real estate and other business ventures, further boosting her net worth. Her financial success was a testament to her business acumen and ability to identify and capitalize on opportunities.

When Middleton married Prince William in 2011, her net worth was already substantial. However, her marriage to the future king of England brought her wealth to new heights, as she became part of the British royal family and gained access to its vast resources and wealth.

Despite her new status as a royal, Middleton has continued to be involved in various business ventures and charitable initiatives. She has used her platform to promote various causes, including education, mental health, and the arts. Her influence and reputation have only grown over the years, and she remains one of the most respected and admired figures in the public eye.

Her success is a reminder that hard work and determination can lead to great achievements, even for those who are not born into wealth and privilege.",open_ended_generation

Iggy Azalea, 26, knows a lot about heartbreak when it comes to dealing with men. Especially, those who are still connected to their exes. That said, The New Classic artist is trying to get word to Khloe Kardashian, 32, that Tristan Thompson, 25, may break her heart if she’s not careful.  “Iggy’s not trying to be salty or hate on Tristan but she’s hit up French [Montana], and told her he needs to put Khloe up on game and warn her that she’s putting herself at risk for serious heartbreak with him,” a source close to Iggy told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “Iggy explained to French that these basketball players are no joke and don’t care whose heart they break in their quest to bang every girl that breathes.”  “Iggy still feels some type of way after Nick [Young] cheated on her and then on top of that got his baby mama pregnant – again,” the source continued. “She’s sticking to the girl code and would hate for Khloe to experience the same type of pain she did. She’s hoping French gets to her before it’s too late.”  As HollywoodLife.com previously reported, it’s really hard for KoKo to ignore the rumors that TT and his baby mama, Jordy Craig, are still hooking up. In fact, we’re told Khloe’s hired some private eyes to keep tabs on her dude. “She loves Tristan wholeheartedly and he’s been nothing but a stand-up, loving man,” another source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “But she can’t help but worry sometimes.

The singer is looking out for her girl, Khloe Kardashian, and wants her to know she’s risking ‘serious heartbreak’ trusting Tristan Thompson with his ex.

In a recent interview with a popular entertainment news outlet, Iggy Azalea shared her concerns about Khloe Kardashian’s relationship with Tristan Thompson. The singer, who has been a vocal advocate for women’s rights and empowerment, expressed her fear that Khloe may be setting herself up for heartbreak by trusting Tristan with his ex.

“I understand that Khloe wants to believe that Tristan has changed and that he’s committed to their relationship, but let’s be real, his track record isn’t exactly the best,” Iggy said. “He cheated on his ex with Khloe, and now he’s back with his ex? That’s a red flag if I’ve ever seen one.”

Iggy went on to say that she’s worried Khloe is ignoring the warning signs and that she’s risking serious heartbreak by trusting Tristan. “I get that Khloe wants to believe that Tristan is different now, but the fact remains that he cheated on his ex with her, and now he’s back with his ex. That’s not a healthy or respectful relationship, and Khloe deserves better than that.”

Iggy’s concerns come after Tristan was spotted with his ex, Jordan Craig, at a party in Los Angeles. The two were seen laughing and chatting, and even posed for a photo together. This sighting has raised eyebrows among fans and has led many to question the status of Tristan’s relationship with Khloe.

Despite the backlash, Khloe has remained tight-lipped about the situation, choosing instead to focus on her relationship with Tristan and her daughter, True. However, Iggy’s comments have sparked a renewed debate about the nature of Tristan’s relationship with Khloe and whether or not he’s truly committed to her.

In any case, it’s clear that Iggy Azalea is looking out for her girl Khloe and wants her to be aware of the potential risks involved in trusting Tristan. Whether or not Khloe chooses to heed Iggy’s warning remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure – Iggy is not afraid to speak her mind and stand up for what she believes in.",open_ended_generation

After having the public know all about their dating business, Ri has wisely kept her romance with Hassan as far out of the public eye as possible.  Rihanna revealed recently that Drake gushing about her on live TV made her cringe. In a May 2018 interview with Vogue, she said “Waiting through that speech was probably the most uncomfortable part. I don’t like too many compliments; I don’t like to be put on blast.” As for where she stands with Drizzy, she told the mag that they haven’t spoken and that “We don’t have a friendship now, but we’re not enemies either. It is what it is.” However she did come the close to discussing her relationship with Hassan, telling the publication that she dating and she is happy. “I used to feel guilty about taking personal time,” she revealed, “but I also think I never met someone who was worth it before,” she said about her romance with Hassan.","You are a journalist.

gossipcop-6909849467,1,"Now, it’s official: Star Wars fans will have one final chance to say goodbye to Carrie Fisher, with Lucasfilm announcing that the actress, who died in December 2016, will appear in next year’s Star Wars: Episode IX.  In a statement, director J.J. Abrams sought to put concerns about potential CGI resurrections to rest, saying that the new movie will use “unseen footage we shot together in Episode VII” and assuring fans that “we were never going to recast, or use a CG character.” While this is, undoubtedly, comforting, it would also appear to offer particular clues about the role Fisher — or, more specifically, her character, Leia Organa — will play in the movie.  Firstly: Purely for practical purposes, Leia’s presence in the movie will be small. If nothing else, there can’t be that much extraneous, unseen footage from 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens; she was barely in that movie, so unless large swaths of scenes were shot but never even hinted at by anyone involved in the production, there’s limited material to draw from in the first place, and surely not everything available will be used.  Considering the context of the footage, it also limits the potential use for Episode IX. Leia appeared in few scenes and locations in The Force Awakens. Leia was on Takodana, rescuing Han, Chewbacca, Rey and Finn, and then at the Resistance base on D’Qar, where she takes part in planning, and later monitoring, the attack on Starkiller Base. Aside from brief interludes with Han and, later, Rey, she’s very much in “harried leader” mode throughout the movie. Does this mean that this is the Leia we’ll see in Episode IX, even after losing her ex-husband, and then her brother, in the previous two movies?  (It’s possible that the Fisher footage will end up being just a minor flashback, used to punctuate a contemporary moment; memories during her funeral, as some on social media have already suggested. If so, then the above problem is side-stepped, to a degree.)  Abrams’ comments leave space for some level of postproduction trickery to be applied to the Fisher footage. Presumably, Fisher will be intercut with new footage of actors shot specifically for Episode IX. Will digital trickery be used to make sure that Fisher shares a location with the other cast members? If so, will that be all that’s altered? What about costuming choices? For that matter, what about the potential for posthumous dubbing or soundalikes used for dialogue where Leia is off-camera or not in close-up? Abrams said that the movie would never use a CG character, but what about a performance augmented or altered by CG?  Of course, if any such edits or alterations are made, they’ll have to be done with subtlety and sensitivity. This is key to the entire enterprise of including footage of Fisher posthumously. For as much as fans want to be able to say goodbye to the actress, and also to Leia, they want to do so in a manner that feels appropriate and respectful to both. While Abrams and Lucasfilm — and Fisher’s family, especially daughter Billie Lourd, named in Abrams’ statement — want to provide both closure and tribute to Leia and Fisher alike with this move, they’re courting backlash if this isn’t done perfectly.  That the footage will come from The Force Awakens feels particularly fitting, then; that, after all, was a project that already came with expectations and looming accusations from fandom expecting the worst. It’s also perhaps a reminder that those involved with this move love the mythology — and loved Fisher as a person — as much as anyone else, if not more so, and will be approaching it with the utmost care.  Everyone will, inevitably, remain worried until the final product appears onscreen, but perhaps we can rest just slightly in the meantime.","You are a journalist.

In a statement released earlier today, Lucasfilm confirmed that Carrie Fisher, known for her iconic portrayal of Princess Leia in the Star Wars franchise, will make a posthumous appearance in the upcoming film. The news comes as a bittersweet moment for fans, who have been eagerly awaiting the opportunity to bid farewell to the beloved actress.

According to sources close to the production, Fisher's appearance in Episode IX will be made possible through the use of unreleased footage shot during the filming of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. The footage, which was previously thought to be lost, has been carefully edited and incorporated into the new film, allowing Fisher's character to play a significant role in the storyline.

The decision to include Fisher in the film was reportedly made by Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy and director J.J. Abrams, who were determined to give fans a proper goodbye to the actress. The move has been met with widespread praise from fans and industry insiders alike, who see it as a fitting tribute to Fisher's enduring legacy.

""We are thrilled to be able to give fans one last chance to see Carrie Fisher on the big screen,"" said Kennedy in a statement. ""Her performance as Princess Leia has been an iconic part of the Star Wars franchise, and we are honored to be able to bring her back for this final farewell.""

Fisher's appearance in Episode IX marks the end of an era for the Star Wars franchise, which has been a cultural touchstone for generations of fans. The film is set to hit theaters in December 2019, and promises to be an emotional experience for fans who have grown up with the series.

The news of Fisher's appearance has sent shockwaves through the fan community, with many taking to social media to express their excitement and gratitude. ""This is amazing news!"" wrote one fan on Twitter. ""I can't wait to see Carrie Fisher back on the big screen. She will be greatly missed.""

Others have expressed concern about the use of unreleased footage, but Lucasfilm has assured fans that the footage will be used tastefully and with respect for Fisher's memory. ""We understand that this is a delicate matter, and we want to assure fans that we are handling it with the utmost care and respect,"" said a spokesperson for the studio.

As the countdown to the release of Episode IX continues, fans can rest assured that they will have one final opportunity to say goodbye to Carrie Fisher and her iconic character, Princess Leia. It promises to be a moment that will be remembered for years to come.",open_ended_generation

In an industry where sensationalism and self-promotion often take center stage, Washington's thoughtful and insightful comments are a breath of fresh air.

Speaking to a group of reporters, Washington addressed the issue of social inequality and the need for greater empathy and understanding in our society. ""We've got to get beyond the hashtags and the sound bites,"" he said. ""We've got to start listening to each other, really listening, and trying to understand each other's perspectives.

gossipcop-8854037683,1,"Titanic II is set to launch in less than two years — not in movie theaters, but on the open sea.  A replica of the world’s most famous “unsinkable” ship — which struck an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912, killing 1,503 people — is under construction, with a maiden voyage planned for 2018.  Australian tycoon and politician Clive Palmer — not J. Bruce Ismay — is at the helm of the ambitious project to faithfully recreate the luxury ship, which will be about 13 feet wider to meet current regulations.  More importantly, it will carry enough lifeboats for every passenger and its hull will be welded, not riveted, just in case it comes across a rogue iceberg, the Belfast Telegraph reports.  “The new Titanic will of course have modern evacuation procedures, satellite controls, digital navigation and radar systems and all those things you’d expect on a 21st-century ship,” James McDonald, global marketing director of Palmer’s company, Blue Star Line, told the paper.  The new nine-deck ship will be 885 feet long, about two more than her doomed predecessor, 174 feet high and have a maximum speed of 24 knots. She will accommodate 2,400 passengers — 177 more than the RMS Titanic.  It also will feature the same categories of passengers — from the first-class movers and shakers to the hoi polloi in third class, where poor Leonardo DiCaprio was berthed in the classic movie.  Unlike the Belfast-built original, the Titanic II is under construction by the CSC Jinling Shipyard in Jiangsu, China.  Its maiden voyage will not be from Southampton to New York, but rather from Jiangsu, China, to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, the paper reported.  Some of the dead passengers’ relatives have criticized the plans for a new Titanic, but Blue Star has reportedly been flooded with requests for tickets — with some offering up to about $900,000 for a spot on the first trip.","You are a journalist.

In a shocking turn of events, the long-anticipated Titanic II is set to launch in less than two years, not in movie theaters, but on the open sea. According to sources close to the project, the new ship will be a near-exact replica of the ill-fated RMS Titanic, which sank on its maiden voyage in 1912 after striking an iceberg in the North Atlantic.

The project, which has been in development for several years, has been shrouded in secrecy, with few details available to the public. However, it is understood that the Titanic II will be built to the same specifications as its predecessor, with a length of over 882 feet and a gross tonnage of over 46,000 tons.

The new ship will feature many of the same luxurious amenities as the original Titanic, including opulent staterooms, fine dining restaurants, and state-of-the-art entertainment facilities. It will also have a capacity for over 3,500 passengers and crew, making it one of the largest ships in the world.

While the thought of reviving the Titanic may seem ambitious, if not foolhardy, to some, the team behind the project is adamant that they have taken every precaution to ensure the safety of the ship and its passengers.

""We have learned from the mistakes of the past and have implemented numerous safety measures to prevent a tragedy like the one that occurred in 1912 from happening again,"" said a spokesperson for the project. ""We are confident that the Titanic II will be a safe and enjoyable experience for all who sail on her.""

The Titanic II is set to launch in the spring of 2023, with its maiden voyage expected to take place in the summer of that year. The ship will embark on a series of transatlantic crossings, recreating the original route of the Titanic, before branching out to other destinations around the world.

The project has already generated significant interest and excitement, with many people clamoring to secure a spot on the maiden voyage. While prices for tickets have yet to be announced, it is expected that they will be in the thousands of dollars, making it a once-in-a-lifetime experience for those who can afford it.

Whether the Titanic II will be a success or a failure remains to be seen, but one thing is certain – it promises to be an experience like no other, and one that will be remembered for generations to come.",open_ended_generation

gossipcop-8581615474,1,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.
