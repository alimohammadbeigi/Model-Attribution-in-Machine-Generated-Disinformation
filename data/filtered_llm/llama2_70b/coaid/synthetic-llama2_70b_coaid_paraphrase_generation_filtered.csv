The mayor's order, which was issued on July 29, exempted government activities, including travel for work, from the 14-day self-quarantine requirement. Members of Congress fall under this exemption.  The meme also fails to note that the mayor's order was issued in response to the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the District of Columbia and was intended to help slow the spread of the virus.  The mayor's office also clarified that the exemption for government activities was included in the order to ensure that essential services and functions of the government continue without disruption.

The mayor of Washington, Muriel Bowser, did not exclude members of Congress from the 14-day quarantine mandate following their visit to John Lewis' funeral in Georgia, as has been claimed in Facebook posts that have gone viral. The mayor's directive, which was released on July 29 in response to the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in Washington, D.C., actually exempted government activities, such as work-related travel, from the quarantine requirement. This exemption, which was already in place, also applies to members of Congress. The mayor's office emphasized that the purpose of the order was to help slow the spread of the virus and that the exemption for government activities was necessary to ensure the continuation of essential services and functions of the government.",paraphrase_generation

The 'passage' is: ",Election years in the United States coincide with major disease outbreaks.  ,"In the 1918 flu pandemic, for instance, the virus spread rapidly during the midterm elections.
Similarly, in 2009, the H1N1 virus emerged just before the spring elections.
In 2014, enterovirus D68, which causes respiratory illness, swept across the country during the midterm elections.
The 2018 midterms saw yet another outbreak of a mysterious polio-like illness.
It seems that election years are a breeding ground for disease. 

The reason for this may be that political campaigns bring people together, providing an opportunity for viruses to spread.
Furthermore, election years often see increased travel and mobility, which can also contribute to the spread of disease.
It is essential for public health officials to be vigilant during election years to prevent the spread of disease. 

In the United States, election years are often associated with the outbreak of various diseases. For example, the 1918 flu pandemic spread rapidly during the midterm elections, while the H1N1 virus emerged just before the spring elections in 2009. In 2014, enterovirus D68, which causes respiratory illness, swept across the country during the midterm elections, and the 2018 midterms saw an outbreak of a mysterious polio-like illness. It appears that election years provide a conducive environment for the spread of diseases, possibly due to the increased gathering of people during political campaigns and the heightened travel and mobility associated with election seasons. As such, it is crucial for public health officials to be vigilant during election years to prevent the spread of diseases.",paraphrase_generation

However, some airlines are still operating, and many are offering discounts to fill their planes. this has led to a situation where some people are choosing to fly even though they are not sure if it is safe. there have been reports of people wearing masks and gloves on planes, and some airlines are providing masks to passengers. despite these precautions, the risk of transmission on planes is still a concern.

Flying during the pandemic has become a risky and unpredictable endeavor. airlines and airports are taking precautions, but the risk of transmission is still present. many people are choosing to avoid flying altogether and opting for other modes of transportation instead.


According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to result in a significant loss of revenue for the airline industry this year, with a predicted loss of 29.3 billion. This is due to the large number of flight cancellations and decreased passenger numbers in countries such as South Korea, China, and Italy. As a result, many airports around the world have become increasingly empty. However, some airlines are still operating, and some are offering discounts to fill their planes. Despite precautions being taken, flying during the pandemic remains a risky and unpredictable endeavor, and many people are choosing to avoid it altogether and opt for other modes of transportation such as trains or buses instead.
