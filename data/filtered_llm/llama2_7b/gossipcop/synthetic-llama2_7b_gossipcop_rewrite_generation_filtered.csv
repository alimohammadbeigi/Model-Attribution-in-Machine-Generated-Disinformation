gossipcop-2266317886,1,"Mark March 21, 2016 on your calendar. Dancing With the Stars will return for its 22nd season with Len Goodman back where he belongs, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champ, and a baby boy or girl for Allison Holker. There's much to look forward to, but not before we close out this season one last time with everything that happened after the finale! (In case you missed it, you can read our recap of the best and worst moments here .) Almost an hour after Tom Bergeron declared Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough the winners of season 21, Bindi was still in disbelief, shouting from the top of her lungs, ""I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!"" Her exuberance and genuine nature endeared her to literally every one on set, but no one more so than Derek. ""It's just so special with Bindi,"" he told reporters backstage. ""She's a champion of life."" Bindi shared the same sentiment, telling those in the ballroom that she gained another brother in Derek. In case you needed further proof that the two are friends for life, consider this: Derek's hopping on a plane to Australia in a couple weeks ""to tackle crocodiles and get my official khakis!"" The Houghster may have nabbed his sixth Mirrorball trophy, but it was his partnership with Bindi that undoubtedly made it his favorite season. ""There's not a thing I would change about this season,"" he told Glamour post-show. ""There's not a week I would change, a dance I would change, and that was a very calming, very peaceful feeling. The show is a completely different show than the first time I won, and to win at this level and the standard that this show has been raised to, it's been incredible."" While Bindi and Derek make the press rounds in New York City, it's no secret that she's itching to get back to her hometown down under. ""I can't wait to get back to all the animals, continue all the conservation work, and carry on in my dad's footsteps."" Season 21 runner-ups Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter were understandably disappointed not to win the big prize, but they both praised Bindi and Derek for their phenomenal journey this season. ""Bindi was the whole package,"" praised the red-haired stunner. ""She and Derek had a beautiful partnership."" Still, ""it's bittersweet in may ways. Did I really want this to be my first Mirrorball? Absolutely. I would be lying if I said I didn't. But Bindi was undeniable this entire season. She grew so much, and she's just such a beautiful person you can't help but be captivated by her. Both [she and Nick] are winners, and I truly believe that."" Echoed Nick: ""It was just such a pleasure to be here. I didn't expect to get anything, so anytime something great happened in the competition, it was a pleasant surprise to me."" So what's up next for Nick? Well, aside from getting ready for Baby Boy Carter , his solo album ( All American ) drops today, and he has a movie coming out next year that he wrote and directed. As for third-place contestant, Alek Skarlatos , he'll be heading on the DWTS Tour this winter, but his immediate plans are much simpler: ""I can't wait to get on the plane tonight to eat. A lot."" But what about his dating life? Any updates on that? ""It's been pretty crazy, honestly. [I haven't had time] for many dates lately."" Added Lindsay: ""I'll be his wing woman on tour!"" During all the hectic action backstage, Allison Holker was a ball of energy, especially for someone six month's pregnant. ""I feel incredible!"" gushed the pro. ""Dancing around with a baby that's the size of a football in your belly is never an easy task, but it's been amazing. Although I never expected to see myself in a sparkly costume on the Dancing With the Stars stage six months pregnant!"" Allison (and husband tWitch) will find out the baby's gender on December 10, ""which is our anniversary too."" In case you're wondering, she'll reveal whether it's a boy or a girl on social media shortly thereafter! In the meantime, Allison's prepping for her first Thanksgiving in charge of the turkey as long as the nerves don't get the best of her. ""I heard you have to brine it, but I don't even know what that means!"" she laughed. ""I'm watching The Chew to learn techniques!"" One of the biggest stories backstage was the announcement that Len Goodman would be returning to the judges' table next season, and the news was heralded with much excitement from the pros. ""I can't wait,"" admitted Mark Ballas . ""I love Len. We missed him this season. It was definitely different, [so it will be] good to have him back in the driver's seat."" Allison Holker felt the same way: ""I think Len Goodman was the heart and soul of Dancing With the Stars and was such a great leader at the judges' table, along with Bruno, Carrie Ann, and Julianne."" Casting is currently underway for season 22. If Mark Ballas gets his wish, he'd love to have girlfriend BC Jean compete as a contestant. ""She would be great, but you know [the producers] would probably mess with us and give her to Derek!"" Mark joked. So what was B.C.'s take on this idea? ""Yeah, and we'd probably win,"" she laughed of the possibility of being paired with Mark's best friend and honorary brother. Speaking of Derek, Mark told us backstage that getting to perform with BC (who he called ""the love of my life"") while Derek and Bindi danced was his favorite part of the evening. ""It was just amazing, cool, and unique. I've been on this show nearly 10 years in a row, and I've never experienced something like that.

gossipcop-2761931201,1,"Lou Rocco/Getty Images  How Michael Strahan’s net worth was built  Michael Strahan has grown his wealth through 14 years of playing pro football and his second career as a talk-show host.  The son of an Army major, Strahan grew up in Germany and did not play competitive high school football until his senior year when his parents sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in Texas.  The former defensive end played well enough to earn a scholarship to Texas Southern University. By his senior year of college, he had set a record for sacks, which got the attention of the NFL.  In 1993, the New York Giants drafted Strahan as the 40th overall draft pick. Over the next 14 seasons, he became the league’s all-time quarterback sack leader, played in the Pro Bowl and helped the Giants defeat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII.  Upon retiring in 2008, Strahan concentrated on his off-field talents. In 2012, he became Kelly Ripa’s “Live! With Kelly” co-host, replacing longtime host Regis Philbin. Four years later, he left the show and joined ABC’s “Good Morning America”; it took more than a year for “Live” to announce Ryan Seacrest as its new co-host.  Strahan also serves as a Fox NFL Sunday analyst during the football season.  As of May 2017, Strahan’s net worth was $65 million, with a salary of $17 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.

gossipcop-7392274516,1,"They both looked so happy, and so relaxed. They were beaming as they said their vows, and luckily, no one came forward to provide any reason that they might not be married. (This is always an exciting moment in a ceremony.) It was an extraordinary mix of tradition and modernity, of centuries of history and up-to-the moment flourishes. Oprah was here, and so was Meghan’s mother, an African-American social worker who wore a conventional mother-of-the-bride outfit and also a nose stud. It somehow looked charming and just right. The entire royal family was here, along with a complement of English aristocrats and important personages. The music was stately and beautiful. The setting was awe-inspiring. There was a flotilla of clergymen, an extraordinary mélange including the archbishop of Canterbury and — in a striking inclusion in this most ancient of places — the head of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Curry. Chosen to give the address to the congregations, Bishop Curry, who is African-American, quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His voice rising and falling with emotion, he made a big, generous, impassioned case for love as the most important thing there is, in religion and in life. His address came after a reading by Lady Jane Fellowes, Harry’s aunt (her sister was Diana, Princess of Wales) that was both full of joy and a signal, it seemed, that the sadness in Harry’s life since his mother’s death had finally lifted. It was a passage from the Song of Solomon: “Arise my love, my fair one, and come away; for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The dress was a success: sculptural simplicity. Photo Our fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, is also watching, and she has a quick take for us on Meghan Markle’s dress. It was absolutely simple: pure and sculptural, in double bonded silk cady with a wide boatneck, long sleeves and sweeping train. It was Meghan Markle’s wedding dress. It was by Clare Waight Keller, a British woman and the first female designer of Givenchy. And it was everything people had hoped. This was not a Cinderella choice, not one that spoke of fantasy or old-fashioned fairy tales. Instead, it placed the woman proudly front and center and underscored Ms. Markle’s own independence. At the same time, it celebrated female strength, promoted a local designer and reached a hand across to Europe (where Ms. Waight Keller has a day job). The five-meter veil was of silk tulle, with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads and organza, and contained embroidery representing the flora of all 53 Commonwealth nations. Video And it was entirely a surprise. In all the rumors that had swirled around The Dress, from Ralph & Russo to Stella McCartney, Ms. Waight Keller’s name had never come up. In the end, Ms. Markle outthought us all. As this starts, long may it continue. And the After-Party Dress The newly minted Duke and Duchess of Sussex departed Windsor for their evening reception at Frogmore House in a very James Bond fashion. The duchess wore a second dress by designer Stella McCartney. You can read our fashion critic Vanessa Friedman’s reaction here. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A good time was had by all (even before the cocktails). Photo Unlike a lot of weddings — and certainly unlike Kate and William’s wedding, just seven years ago — the guests inside hung out in the aisles, air-kissing and gossiping. It’s a great royal-and-celebrity cocktail party! (Sadly without cocktails.) Kate and William’s wedding was solemn, stately, stuffy, full of dignitaries, politicians, and the sort of boring personages known here as the great and the good. But this looked totally fun for the guests — even more fun than, say, the Academy Awards — because no one was competing for anything and no one was forced to talk about their outfits to television reporters. Part of the change in tone is down to the passage of time and to how much Britain, or perhaps the royal family, has changed in the last few years. Another reason, of course, is that Harry, being the second son and not a future king, has the freedom to be more relaxed, less constrained by tradition, and less conventional than his brother. This wedding has nothing to do with dynasty, or ensuring the security of the royal line. (We hope they have kids! But only because it’s fun to have kids, not because it would be some sort of international crisis if they did not.) This wedding had everything to do with two people who are totally into each other and wanted to have a great big happy celebration. Oprah, Beckhams and Clooneys, oh my! Photo One of the great excitements about any wedding, of course, is the moment you learn who has been invited and who has not. Meghan and Harry’s list was kept secret, until the very moment that dozens of mysterious figures started to enter St. George’s Chapel. It was very exciting. There was none other than Oprah Winfrey, in a snug pink dress, a pair of very cool sunglasses and a massive broad-brimmed hat spectacularly festooned with flowers. If anyone qualifies as American royalty, it is surely Oprah, with her ability to transcend race and background, and her great gift for openness and emotional candor.

They have always done such a good job of wearing appropriate outfits, smiling tastefully and saying nothing. There was Charles Spencer, the Earl of Althorp, Diana’s brother, perhaps known best for his active love life and his impassioned attack on the British media after his sister’s death. It turned into Celebrity Central. George and Amal Clooney made their stately, Hollywood-y entrance (She was in yellow with an interesting train). David and Victoria Beckham, a.k.a.

She’s Had Relationships With Several Male Celebrities Lovato, like most notable celebrities, have dated other people in the industry. According to Pop Sugar, she dated The Cab frontman Alex DeLeon from 2008-09, and later based the breakup song “Catch Me” on him. Lovato also had brief flings with Trace Cyrus (Miley’s older brother) in 2009 and Joe Jonas, her self-proclaimed “BFF,” in 2010. Her most notable relationship to date, however, has been with Valderrama, whom she dated from from 2010 to 2016. In an interview with Latina magazine, Lovato discussed what attracted her to the That 70’s Show actor: When I dated white guys, it wasn’t as passionate as my relationship with Wilmer. Maybe that’s just Wilmer. But I do believe that Latin people are just more expressive, more passionate with their emotions. He’s very manly, and he can be stubborn like Latino men can, but he’s protective and he cares so much and loves so hard. I’ve been blessed enough to have him in my life, and not just as my man, but also my best friend. Since her breakup from Valderrama, Lovato’s been seen with MMA fighter Guilherme “Bomba” Vasconcelos and Abedini. 3. Ruby Rose Claims that She & Lovato ‘Hooked Up’ in 2013 In 2013, model and actress Ruby Rose turned heads when she tweeted that she had a lesbian tryst with Lovato. “I’m like the one person demi has slept with that didn’t sell on naked photos of her so eff off,” Rose tweeted out. She went on to say “Think ill take a few days off social media whilst @ddlovato’s friends attack me for being a ‘scorned ex-lover’ get over it! I liked the hair.” Furthermore, a source for Life & Style said that Rose and Lovato dated for two years while the singer took a break from her relationship with Valderrama. A post shared by Ruby Rose (@rubyrose) on Aug 13, 2017 at 1:32pm PDT Lovato addressed these claims in a 2015 interview with Complex magazine. “Rumours are rumours, and people are going to spread them,” she said. “You can believe what you want, but no, I was not in a relationship with her. By the way, love is fluid.” The singer added “Whether there’s been rumours with one specific person or not, that’s all that matters. Humans are humans, and when you connect with somebody on a spiritual level it doesn’t matter. I don’t want people to ever look at the past or rumours or anything and try to figure me out.” 4. She Won the GLAAD Vanguard Award for Promoting LGBTQ Equality While Lovato may be keeping her personal life under wraps, she has made no effort to hide her support for the LGBTQ community. The singer has been so supportive, in fact, that she was given the GLAAD Vanguard Award in 2016, which, according to the GLAAD website, is “presented to media professionals who have made a significant difference in promoting equality and acceptance.” The award was given to her by close friend and former Camp Rock co-star Nick Jonas. “Demi Lovato has consistently used her platform as a successful artist to send messages of acceptance and support to LGBT people everywhere,” said GLAAD President & CEO Sarah Kate Ellis. “She is an extraordinary ally who is committed to helping young people embrace who they are and live the lives they love.” During her acceptance speech, Lovato said “You should always love yourself for who you are,” she said. “The skin that you are in, whether you identify with it and are afraid to tell people, just go for it.

When asked by Complex about the song, Lovato responded, “I’m not denying it or confirming it. I’m just in a place where I’m feeling very free.” She added, “I think it’s important to be honest with yourself and with your fans, but also to be respectful of people’s feelings and to not just throw it out there and be like, ‘Oh, I’m gay!’ or ‘I’m straight!’ It’s like, I’m just me, and that’s it.” When it comes to Lovato’s sexuality, one thing is for sure: she’s keeping us all guessing. Demi Lovato has sparked rumors of a new romance with Lauren Abedini, a Los Angeles-based DJ who goes by the stage name Kittens. While there’s yet to be any confirmation from Lovato or Abedini’s representatives as to whether they’re dating, fans on social media have been eager to voice their support. Demi Lovato has been open about her support for the LGBTQ community, and has even won the GLAAD Vanguard Award for promoting equality. However, when it comes to her own sexuality, the singer remains tight-lipped, only saying that she’s feeling “very free.”",rewrite_generation
gossipcop-5319163677,1,"Come December, it's become near tradition over the past few years for everyone to complain about how the previous 12 months have been the worst ever. This year, however really, really feels like it. This year has been a barrage of bizarre and bummer headlines that at times it's felt like some dystopian nightmare.  It's been so bad that the Kardashian-West clan have just decided to end 2016 early. Yes, Kim and Kanye have decided to cancel all public and professional commitments for the end of the year and plan to maintain their social media blackouts as well. To be exact, a flack told Page Six that Kim and Kanye “plan on taking the rest of 2016 off and spending time as a family.""  Which, frankly, we wish we all could do, don't we?  Is it possible for President Obama's last major act to be an executive decree for us to just all get a chance to chill out and recuperate for the remaining 26 days left in this bummer of a year? Sure, there's no political safeguarding against any potential additional music legends from dying or preventing any further tragedies and disasters from happening or ensuring that some new odd Zika-like disease pops up, but there's got to be something? How about the ""Netflix and Chill Act?"" Just an order that all Americans get to spend the next month relaxing and catching up on any television series they may have missed this year.  Of course, when it comes to Kim and Kanye it's understandable that they've decided to literally cancel the rest of their 2016. Kim was still in the midst of recuperating from being robbed at gunpoint in Paris when her husband Kanye was hospitalized following a very public breakdown.

Kanye was released from an L.A.-area hospital last week after spending more than a week receiving treatment for exhaustion. Kim West was reportedly by his side throughout the entire ordeal and now wants to make sure Kanye continues to receive therapy and treatment now that he's out of the hospital.

Hopefully, a rested and healthier Kim and Kanye can get back into form and provide us with the not-quite-as-tragic-as-this distractions we'll probably desperately need in the new year.

In fact, the source adds, ""Kim is still very much in 'mama bear' mode with Saint and North.""  Which is to say she's still very focused on taking care of her two young children.

My rewrite: As the year draws to a close, it's becoming increasingly apparent that 2016 has been a particularly challenging one for many of us. From the unprecedented number of celebrity deaths to the seemingly endless stream of political upheaval, it's been a non-stop barrage of bad news. Even the Kardashian-West clan, who have been known to exude an aura of invincibility, have been hit hard. Kim was robbed at gunpoint in Paris, while Kanye was hospitalized following a public breakdown. It's little wonder, then, that they've decided to take the rest of the year off. According to a source close to the family, Kim is still taking things ""very slow"" and is focused on taking care of her two young children. It's a sentiment that many of us can relate to, as we struggle to come to terms with the events of the past 12 months. Unfortunately, it's unlikely that 2017 will bring any respite from the turmoil. As such, it's more important than ever that we take the time to recharge and regroup. Perhaps, as a society, we could benefit from a collective ""Netflix and Chill Act,"" allowing us all to take a much-needed break from the constant barrage of bad news. In the meantime, we can only hope that Kim and Kanye are able to find the peace and tranquility they so desperately need.",rewrite_generation

The groom, Prince Harry, is a member of the British royal family; the bride, Meghan Markle, is an American and former actress.[note 1] On the morning of the wedding, Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, conferred upon him the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. On her marriage, Markle became Duchess of Sussex.[1] The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, officiated at the wedding using the standard Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony published in Common Worship, the liturgical text of the Church of England.[2][3] Announcement of engagement [ edit ] Prince Harry is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. He and Meghan Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the Canadian-American legal-drama television series Suits, have been in a relationship since 2016, having first met in July 2016.[4] The relationship was officially acknowledged on 8 November 2016, when a statement was released from the royal family's communications secretary addressing the ""wave of abuse and harassment"" directed toward Markle.[5] Harry and Meghan attending church on Christmas Day, 2017 On 27 November 2017, Clarence House announced that Prince Harry would marry Markle in the spring of 2018.[6] They were engaged earlier the same month in London, with the Prince giving Markle a bespoke engagement ring made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, consisting of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection.[7] At the same time, it was announced that they would live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace following their marriage.[8] The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh expressed their delight at the news, while congratulations came in from various political leaders, including the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[8] During the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace's Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[9][10] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[7][11] Markle is the second American[note 2] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[12] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[13][14][15][16][17] Under the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign's consent in order to marry. Harry was fifth in line at the time of his engagement.[18] The Queen's consent was declared to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 14 March 2018.[19][20] Although Markle attended a private Catholic school in her early years, she is not Roman Catholic.[21] On 6 March 2018, she was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at St. James's Palace.[22] Although Markle was divorced, the Anglican Church has permitted marriage to divorced persons with a living spouse since 2002.[23][24] After the engagement, Markle began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[25] She will retain her U.S. citizenship during the process,[26] but Kensington Palace have indicated that the decision on whether she will retain dual nationality has not yet been made.[25] Retaining U.S. citizenship is expected to create tax complications.[27] The couple was invited to celebrate Christmas 2017 with the royal family at the Queen's Sandringham estate.[28] The official engagement photographs were taken by Alexi Lubomirski (a former assistant to Mario Testino) at Frogmore House, and were issued by Kensington Palace on 21 December 2017.[29] To mark the wedding of Harry and Meghan, the Royal Mint produced an official UK £5 coin, showing the couple in profile.[30] In May, a set of commemorative postage stamps, featuring the couple's official engagement photographs, was issued by Royal Mail.[31] Wedding [ edit ] Planning [ edit ] Preparation for wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Unlike the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the wedding day of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was not declared a bank holiday.[32] The wedding was on the same date as the FA Cup Final, which Prince Harry's brother William normally attends in his role as President of the Football Association.[33] Holding the royal wedding on a weekend is a break with the royal tradition of having weddings on a weekday.[34] On 12 February 2018, Kensington Palace announced that the ceremony would commence at 12:00 Midday BST. Venue [ edit ] The wedding took place on Saturday, 19 May 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor.[35] The chapel had previously been the venue for the weddings of Prince Harry's uncle, the Earl of Wessex, as well as that of his cousin, Peter Phillips, and for the blessing of the marriage of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, Harry's stepmother.[36] Cost [ edit ] The royal family announced that they would pay for the wedding.[37] The costs for the cake, the florist, and the catering have been estimated to be £50,000, £110,000, and £286,000 respectively,[38] and the overall cost is expected to be around £32 million.[39] The security costs are expected to be lower than those of the 2011 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.[40] The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead has reportedly spent £2.6 million on cleaning the town and roads.[40] It has been predicted that the wedding will trigger a tourism boom and boost the economy by up to £500 million.[41] Wedding attire [ edit ] The wedding invitations specified a dress code for men of ""Dress Uniform, Morning Coat","You are a journalist.

Venue [ edit ] The wedding took place on Saturday, 19 May 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor.[35] The chapel had previously been the venue for the weddings of Prince Harry's uncle, the Earl of Wessex, as well as that of his cousin, Peter Phillips, and for the blessing of the marriage of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, Harry's stepmother.[36] Cost [ edit ] The royal family announced that they would pay for the wedding.[37] The costs for the cake, the florist, and the catering have been estimated to be £50,000, £110,000, and £286,000 respectively,[38] and the overall cost is expected to be around £32 million.[39] The security costs are expected to be lower than those of the 2011 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.[40] The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead has reportedly spent £2.6 million on cleaning the town and roads.[40] It has been predicted that the wedding will trigger a tourism boom and boost the economy by up to £500 million.[41] Wedding attire [ edit ] The wedding invitations specified a dress code for men of ""Dress Uniform, Morning Coat","or Lounge Suit"" and for women of ""Day dress with a hat.""[42] The Queen wore a light blue coat and a matching hat designed by Angela Kelly, her personal dresser, to the wedding.[43] The bridesmaids and page boys wore a white gazar dress with a peter pan collar and a pleated skirt designed by Ralph Lauren.[44] The bride wore a Givenchy wedding dress with an 16-foot long train and a five-metre-long veil.[45] The dress was designed by Clare Waight Keller, the first female designer to create a wedding dress for a British royal bride.[46] The dress was made from a double-bonded silk organza and featured a high neckline and a sleeve design that resembled the late Princess Diana's wedding dress.[47] The veil was made from a 16-foot-long delicate tulle, hand-embroidered with floral designs in silk and gazar, and featured a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk.[48] The dress and veil were kept in place with the Cartier Halo Tiara, a loan from Queen Elizabeth II.[49] The bridal bouquet consisted of 57 white roses, 16 of which were fragrant, as well as sprigs of myrtle, a symbol of love and marriage, and a sprig of royal roses.[50] The bridesmaids carried a smaller version of the bouquet, with the page boys carrying a smaller version of the bridesmaids' bouquets.[51] The wedding rings were made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, and were made from a piece of Welsh gold, gifted to Harry by the Queen.[52] The ceremony [ edit ] The wedding ceremony was conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, in the chapel of St George, Windsor Castle, at 12:00 Midday BST on 19 May 2018.[53] The ceremony lasted for approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes.[54] The couple exchanged personal vows during the ceremony, which was also attended by 600 guests, including 200 members of the public.[55] The service was broadcast live on BBC One and ITV, with a peak audience of 18.9 million viewers in the UK.[56] The ceremony included readings from the Reverend Jonathan Sacks and the Reverend Michael Curry, the former being a former Chief Rabbi and the latter being the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States.[57] The choir consisted of 19 singers and the organist, who performed music including ""This Little Light of Mine"" and ""The Power of Love"".[58] The ceremony also included a blessing from the Archbishop of York, John Sentamu, who read from the Book of Proverbs.[59] After the ceremony, the couple emerged from the chapel for a brief appearance on the West Steps of the castle, where they shared a kiss and greeted guests.[60] The newlyweds then left the castle in a carriage procession through Windsor Town, accompanied by a detachment of the Household Calvary and the Grenadier Guards, as well as a flypast by the Royal Air Force.[61] The couple and their guests then attended a reception at St George's Hall, Windsor Castle, hosted by the Queen.[62] The evening reception was held at Frogmore House, a Grade I listed building in the Home Park, Windsor, which is owned by the Queen and has been used for various royal events, including Prince Harry and Markle's engagement photographs.[63] The menu included a variety of canapés, including smoked salmon, wild garlic and dill, and chicken and vegetable skewers, as well as a three-tiered cake made by the London-based cake designer, Violet Bakery, which was decorated with flowers and greenery.[64] The couple also danced to a performance by the American singer-songwriter, Ben E. King, who performed his hit song, ""Stand by Me"".[65] Reception [ edit ] The evening reception was hosted by the Queen at St George's Hall, Windsor Castle, after the wedding ceremony.[66] The reception was attended by around 200 guests, including the couple's close friends and family, as well as members of the royal family and select guests from the wedding ceremony.[67] The reception featured a three-course meal, with the first course consisting of a choice of either smoked salmon, served with a lemon and herb dressing, or a vegetarian option of a quiche with a tomato and basil salsa.[68] The second course was a choice of either roast beef or vegetarian Wellington, with a side of roasted vegetables, and the third course was a selection of cheeses and chocolates.[69] The cake was made by the London-based cake designer, Violet Bakery, and was decorated with flowers and greenery.[70] After the reception, the couple departed for their honeymoon, reportedly to Namibia.[71] Post-wedding [ edit ] After the wedding, the couple spent their honeymoon in Namibia, where they went on a safari and stayed at the luxury lodge, Hoanib Skeleton Coast Camp.[72] They returned to the UK in July 2018 and resumed their royal duties.[73] The couple will split their time between the UK and North America, with Markle maintaining her ties to the US and Canada, where she was born and raised.[74] The couple's first joint engagement after the wedding was on 1 June 2018, when they visited the Hornsey Road Jewish Primary School in London to learn about the school's Holocaust education program and to plant an oak tree in the school's grounds.[75] The couple also visited the Royal Marines Training Centre in Lympstone, Devon, on 15 June 2018, to learn about the training and development of the Royal Marines.[76] Notes [ edit ] ^ a b The bride is an American and a former actress, whereas the groom is a member of the British royal family. ^ The wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was held on 19 May 2018 in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in the United Kingdom.",rewrite_generation

gossipcop-8055383376,1,"Yes, the headline sounds extremely insane, but then again this is Teresa Giudice we’re talking about here!  According to a new report, the Real Housewives of New Jersey star is planning to cash in on her husband Joe Giudice’s deportation proceedings.  If you recall, it was reported weeks ago that a judge had ruled that Joe should be deported upon his release from prison, where he is currently serving a 41-month-prison sentence for bank and wire fraud. Well now, sources are telling Radar Online that Bravo has offered Teresa $500,000 to film a special about his deportation.  “Teresa was offered big bucks to film a special about Joe’s deportation and she agreed to do it,” an insider revealed. “Half a million dollars to share the story on camera.”  And this story is believable because this isn’t Teresa’s first rodeo when it comes to cashing in on her crimes legal drama!  “It is going to be like the other specials when she was in prison and will show how she and Joe and the girls are handling the scary prospect of Joe getting deported,” added the source.  IS TERESA BEGGING PRESIDENT TRUMP TO STOP JOE’S DEPORTATION?  Earlier this year, an Immigration official confirmed that “records show that an immigration judge ordered Mr. Giudice be removed from the United States on March 14, 2018.”  A source close to Teresa adds that she needs the Bravo money as Joe tries to appeal the deportation order.  “Teresa will do anything for the money. She never stops thinking about taking care of her girls and she agreed to this so that they would have money for college. She is a good mom and wants to provide for her children,” the source stated.  Joe will reportedly be turned over to ICE custody upon his March 2019 release, although it is likely he could be released earlier than March which would mean an earlier deportation back to Italy.  UPDATE – Teresa is denying this report. Her attorney, James Leonard, tells the Gossip Cop website that she has no current plans to do a spinoff show about Joe’s possible deportation.

The 'passage' is: ","Yes, the headline sounds extremely insane, but then again this is Teresa Giudice we’re talking about here!  According to a new report, the Real Housewives of New Jersey star is planning to cash in on her husband Joe Giudice’s deportation proceedings.  If you recall, it was reported weeks ago that a judge had ruled that Joe should be deported upon his release from prison, where he is currently serving a 41-month-prison sentence for bank and wire fraud. Well now, sources are telling Radar Online that Bravo has offered Teresa $500,000 to film a special about his deportation.  “Teresa was offered big bucks to film a special about Joe’s deportation and she agreed to do it,” an insider revealed. “Half a million dollars to share the story on camera.”  And this story is believable because this isn’t Teresa’s first rodeo when it comes to cashing in on her crimes legal drama!  “It is going to be like the other specials when she was in prison and will show how she and Joe and the girls are handling the scary prospect of Joe getting deported,” added the source.

She has no plans to do any shows with Bravo right now and is focusing on her family and her legal issues,” said Leonard.  So there you have it.  If you were thinking of watching a special about Teresa and Joe Giudice’s deportation drama, you may want to think again.  It looks like the Real Housewife is not going to be cashing in on this story after all.  After all, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.  The story seems like a perfect storm of drama, intrigue, and greed.  And it’s not like we haven’t seen Teresa do this before.  Remember when she was convicted of fraud and served time in prison?  That’s when she filmed her famous “Real Housewives of New Jersey” special, which was reportedly worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to her.  So it’s not like she’s new to this game.  And if you think about it, why wouldn’t she take advantage of the situation?  If Joe is going to be deported, she’s going to want to make as much money as possible off of it.  And if that means doing a spinoff show, then so be it.  It’s not like she’s going to be the first reality star to cash in on a family crisis.  So if you’re looking for more drama and intrigue from the Giudice family, keep an eye out for updates on this story.  And who knows, maybe Bravo will offer Teresa another spinoff show.  After all, they can’t seem to get enough of her.  And neither can we!  As always, stay tuned for more updates from the world of reality TV.

Scheduling a day for romance is as joyful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon.  We’re in Stanley’s on St Andrew’s Street in Dublin, downstairs in the wine bar. It’s an unplanned outing after an impromptu cry of “Let’s go out, but not to our usual place”. I’ve eaten here before, and enjoyed it except for some oversalted fish. This is a second chance. They don’t come easily.  But two things happened after the previous review. First, a man who was at the next table wrote to me to say how much he loved Stanley’s. He had no vested interest, but was talking as a well-dined eater about town. Later, I found out that chef and co-owner Stephen McArdle had something more important on his hands than my dinner that night. His son had been born hours before.  If that doesn’t earn a second chance, nothing will. So we’re tucked in at a small table under the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted a soft green. There’s a candle in a wax-crusted wine bottle on the table and high-class jazz standards on the sound system.  For the moment, it feels like we’re not in Dublin. We could be in a city anywhere and lucky enough to find a place we’ll remember fondly when we get home.  The menu is chalked up on the wall and Liam has already ordered some cod croquettes, balls of soft fluffy fish in crispy lagging jackets sitting in a small puddle of silken house mayonnaise.  The star of Stanley’s is Morgan Vanderkamer. She’s the sommelier here. But don’t let that put you off. Bad sommeliers are pretentious up-sellers, there to push diners towards the wallet-busting bruisers on the wine list. Vanderkamer has taken the nonsense out of the role and will open your mind to new ideas about what to drink with your food. If you thought sherry was for fogeys and posers, she will change your mind. So we have ice-cold glasses of manzanilla to cut through the fluffy cod croquettes. We are in excellent hands.  The main event is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. We’re going with an oloroso, the ruby-coloured sherry that gets its colour and kick from time and ageing. There are two on the menu, Vanderkamer says. One is good; the other is “amazing”, and priced accordingly, she warns. With a €16 plate of food between us, we push the sherry cask out and live it large on the oloroso at €13 a glass. It is a good decision.  There’s a small farmyard on that €16 charcuterie plate: generous slices of duck ham, smoked cured slices of moist pink meat. The duck ham is the soulmate of the apricot puree dotted on one side of the plate. The sharp pickled gherkins sing with the “bacon and cabbage”, a slice of ham hock terrine wrapped in crinkly soft leaves of bright-green savoy cabbage.

The pear and vanilla sauce, in a small ramekin, takes the sweetness of the liver to another even more decadent place.  Just in case there isn’t enough on the plate (there is), we’ve ordered a plate of the bean and chorizo stew. The beans are in fact chick peas – but that’s even better in my book – and the chorizo has been minced to a small rubble that sits on top of the soupy mix.

Amidst rumors that the actress is marrying a British businessman, she’s put permanent roots down in California by purchasing the massive Cecil B.

It’s been rumored for weeks that the 41-year-old had plans to purchase Cecil B. DeMille’s historic mansion, and now, she’s bit the bullet, putting down a $25 million offer, according to TMZ. The amount was reportedly accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow.  Cecil’s home, which he lived in until his death in 1959, is considered one of the greatest properties in L.A., and Angie will have some famous neighbors, including Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman and Ellen Pompeo. There’s tons of space for the six kids, too — the house boasts 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, plus a spacious backyard.  This huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53. The possibility of that big move happening seemed even more likely after reports surfaced on April 12 that Angie had met and fallen in love with a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.

I’m not changing the way that I used to be, I just want to have fun and get rowdy.”    But with nearly all remaining members of One Direction releasing new music of their own within weeks of each other, this song is not the only opportunity Payne has had to make his thoughts on his bandmates known. Speaking with Music Choice, he complimented Niall Horan’s new singles, but Harry Styles, not so much. “I’ll be honest with you, it’s not my sort of music. It’s not something I’d listen to,” he said. But he did have a quick save: “I think he did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. That’s the way I’d put it best, I think.” Liam also noted that Harry would probably say the same about his music since Harry doesn’t listen to hip-hop. “My song’s more ‘Rack City’ and his song is more of a different era to something I’d listen to, I guess,” he said. “Strip That Down” does feature a rapper, Migos’s Quavo, but a redux of the only song of note that Tyga has ever made it is not.","You are a journalist.

I’m not changing the way that I used to be, I just want to have fun and get rowdy.”    But with nearly all remaining members of One Direction releasing new music of their own within weeks of each other, this song is not the only opportunity Payne has had to make his thoughts on his bandmates known. Speaking with Music Choice, he complimented Niall Horan’s new singles, but Harry Styles, not so much. “I’ll be honest with you, it’s not my sort of music. It’s not something I’d listen to,” he said. But he did have a quick save: “I think he did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. That’s the way I’d put it best, I think.” Liam also noted that Harry would probably say the same about his music since Harry doesn’t listen to hip-hop. “My song’s more ‘Rack City’ and his song is more of a different era to something I’d listen to, I guess,” he said. “Strip That Down” does feature a rapper, Migos’s Quavo, but a redux of the only song of note that Tyga has ever made it is not.","Liam Payne is following in the footsteps of Zayn Malik by distancing himself from his former group, One Direction, and making his solo debut with a diss track aimed at his former bandmates. On his first single, ""Strip That Down,"" he boldly declares his independence from the boy band, singing ""I used to be in 1D, now I'm out free."" He also expressed his disinterest in Harry Styles' new music, stating that it's not his style and that he wouldn't listen to it. However, he did offer a diplomatic response when asked about Styles' music, saying that he thinks Styles did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. Payne also noted that Styles would likely say the same about his own music, given that he doesn't listen to hip-hop. Despite the apparent feud, Payne's single features a collaboration with Migos's Quavo, suggesting that he is open to working with other artists in the hip-hop genre. Overall, Payne's solo debut marks a significant departure from his time in One Direction and signals his intention to forge his own path in the music industry.",rewrite_generation

gossipcop-4796409702,1,"Kim Kardashian is allegedly “phasing out” mom Kris Jenner, particularly when it comes to her responsibilities as her longtime manager, amid reports Kim is ready for a total image overhaul after returning to the spotlight following her October robbery.  That’s according to a new report by Radar Online, who’s claiming that the mother-daughter duo could be caught in a nasty feud as a source alleged that Kardashian has had somewhat of an epiphany during her time away from the spotlight and allegedly has now opened her eyes to see how Jenner “used her” to build the Kardashian brand.  According to the site, Kim is ready to project a very different image from the uber-glamorous money flaunting Kardashian fans used to know and is allegedly ready to kick mom Kris to the curb, at least professionally, in order to do so.  A source alleged to the site this week that Kim now “seems to be thinking that Kris used her to get where she is today,” which Radar Online is alleging could have led to a nasty feud between Jenner and her daughter as well as the reality star reportedly making a pretty big business decision when it comes to her mom.  “[Kim] will never think of [Kris] in the same way again,” the source said of Jenner’s supposed drama with her daughter amid reports she believes Jenner has been “using” her for years.  The site then went on to report that Kim is now in the process of projecting her new toned-down image amid the feud claims with Kris, revealing that Jenner may no longer play such a big part in Kardashian’s career going forward.  “Kim hired a transition team to make sure that she gives off a different image than she did previously,” the source said of Jenner and her daughter potentially parting ways professionally, claiming that “part of this process includes phasing out [Kris’s] management.”  While Kris and Kim have not commented on the claims, this isn’t the first time it’s been reported that Kardashian may be looking to distance herself from Jenner, at least professionally, in the wake of her October robbery in Paris.  Radar Online claimed back in October that Kim Kardashian had grown wise to Kris Jenner’s “money making machine” after taking some downtime at the end of 2016, alleging at the time that Kim has been so busy with her career that she’s failed to realize how much Jenner, who is often referred to as her “momager,” had been controlling her life and career.  “Kim never realized how much [Kris] and the money-making machine was controlling her until this robbery,” an insider told the site of Kardashian’s feelings about Jenner at the time, months before it was reported that the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is allegedly looking to “phase out” Kris from her career.  “Kim is just starting to think that maybe Kris’s intentions were not pure all along,” continued the source in October, adding that Kim has been doing a lot of thinking about her father Robert Kardashian while taking some time away which has allegedly helped her to get wise to Kris’s seemingly relentless pursuit of fame for herself and her family.  “[Kim] told her family that she wanted to be the girl that her father wanted her to be and not the girl that she became with Kris’s help,” a source revealed last year, just months before it was reported that a feud could be brewing between Kardashian and Jenner.

Kourtney Kardashian, who is currently expecting her fourth child, has sparked fresh speculation about her personal life after being spotted with her former flame, Justin Bieber. According to sources, the reality TV star was seen stepping out with the pop star at a popular Hollywood nightspot, The Peppermint Club, while her sister Kim Kardashian was away in Dubai. This development comes after In Touch Weekly reported that Kourtney is expecting her fourth baby, with the identity of the father remaining unclear. It is worth noting that the eldest Kardashian sister has a history of dating high-profile celebrities, including Scott Disick, with whom she has three children, and Younes Bendjima, who is also believed to be the father of her unborn child.  However, a source close to the family revealed that tensions are running high between Kourtney and Scott, who is allegedly unhappy about his ex's reunion with Justin. The insider claimed that Scott went ""completely MIA"" in Dubai and that no one knew where he was, leading to speculation that he may have been avoiding the situation.  Furthermore, Radar Online reported that Scott told Kourtney that he is not her ""babysitter,"" adding fuel to the rumors of a rift between the pair. This latest development is particularly interesting given that Kourtney and Justin were last seen together in December 2015, when they were spotted at a Los Angeles restaurant, The Nice Guy, before enjoying each other's company at a karaoke club.  Given their history together, it is unsurprising that Kourtney would turn to Justin for comfort, especially given her reported regret over rekindling her relationship with Scott.  As for Scott, it appears that he is still struggling to come to terms with his split from Kourtney, and the recent developments in her personal life only serve to further complicate matters.  As the Kardashian-Jenner clan continues to navigate their complex web of relationships, one thing is clear: drama is never far behind.",rewrite_generation

And I think California is on the front lines of that.”  Parton, who has a home in Tennessee, said she spends most of her time in California working on her business ventures, including her theme parks and restaurants.  “But when I see what is happening there, I can’t help but think of the words of the Bible. God is not mocked, for whatsoever a man sows, that shall he also reap.”  In conclusion, Dolly Parton believes that California is being punished by God for its sins, and predicts that the state will suffer even greater disasters in the future.

The rumor mill has been churning out some misleading information about Barbadian sensation Rihanna. A recent video circulating online, entitled ""Rihanna: 'If Jesus Hasn't Answered Your Prayers, Try Satan,'"" published on the World News Today YouTube Channel on December 2, 2017, has sparked controversy and outrage among Rihanna's fans and followers. The video claims that during a speech at the renaming of a street in Bridgetown, Rihanna made statements that are entirely fabricated and untrue.  According to the video, Rihanna allegedly said, ""If Jesus hasn't answered your prayers, try Satan."" However, this is not what Rihanna actually said during her speech.  The Prime Minister of Barbados, the Rt. Hon. Freundel Stuart, was quick to intervene and address the false claims, confirming that Rihanna did not make any such remarks.  Despite the video's attempts to mislead the public, numerous news outlets were present at the event and captured Rihanna's actual speech, which was entirely innocuous and did not contain any controversial statements.  In fact, Rihanna encouraged the audience, which included her friends and family, and numerous dignitaries, to believe in their dreams and have faith in God. She shared her personal journey and experiences, emphasizing the importance of faith and perseverance in achieving one's goals.  It is important to note that fake news and misinformation can have serious consequences, and it is crucial to verify the authenticity of any information before sharing or believing it. In this case, the facts are clear: Rihanna did not make the statements attributed to her in the fake video, and her actual speech was a heartfelt and inspiring message of hope and encouragement.  As always, it is essential to approach information with a critical and discerning mindset, and to rely on credible sources when sharing or consuming news and information.",rewrite_generation

Miley's Wrecking Ball video, which features her swinging naked on a wrecking ball, has been viewed over 19 million times in its first 24 hours.

""I'm always going to be known for that video,"" she said. ""It's something I can't escape.""  Despite her regrets, Miley has found inspiration for her latest music video, Malibu, from her relationship with fiancé Liam Hemsworth. The pop star, who rekindled her romance with Liam in 2015, said that her new album is influenced by her love for him. ""I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you,"" she said on Australian radio station The Kyle & Jackie O Show. ""I feel like I've found my person, and I want to make music that makes him happy.""

While Miley may regret some of her past actions, it's clear that she has found happiness and inspiration in her relationship with Liam.

gossipcop-2682199068,1,"Reverend Swadley – the local wedding priest and friend of the Pitt family – has confirmed to friends that the A-list couple recently spent a week with Brad’s family, discussing detailed plans for a wedding.  It’s believed the loved-up stars had flown to Missouri because Jen was desperate to reconnect with Brad’s mum, Jane, who she’d developed a very close bond with throughout the time of their first marriage.  During the seven-day visit, it’s been revealed that Jane orchestrated a meeting with the family priest Reverend Swadley – hoping it would be the gentle push Brad and Jen would need to make their reignited relationship official once again.  ‘Reverend Swadley met Jen recently at a family function that Brad’s mum, Jane, threw at their family home in Missouri,’ a close friend of the pastor’s told New Idea exclusively.  ‘Jen accompanied Brad home on the trip and attended church services with the family as well as joining Brad at meetings at the now-retired reverend’s home, who Brad reconnected with after he decided to find himself and renew his faith, following his split from Ange.  ‘He remarked at how at ease Jen was with his family, who clearly adore her, and how everyone said how much she’s been missed and how happy they all were to have her back in Brad’s – and their – lives.’  The source goes on to reveal that Reverend Swadley spoke at length with Brad and Jen about getting married as soon as possible, in Missouri, in a small ceremony, with just local friends and family present.  ‘Reverend Swadley revealed how in love Brad and Jen were and how they planned to officially wed as soon as their divorces were finalised, with him agreeing to conduct the ceremony and welcome them both back into the church,’ the friend of the pastor told New Idea.  Reverend Swadley revealed to our source that it was clear Jen loved seeing Brad’s family again, spending long days talking and laughing for the first time since their 2005 divorce.  ‘Jen spent five days reconnecting with Brad’s parents, brother and sister and many of his childhood friends who he remains close to,’ a friend of the pastor reveals.  Brad Pitt's parents are nothing but supportive Getty  ‘He said Jen kept saying how grateful she was that they’d been brought back together. And how they’ll both be baptised later this year before they officially wed – with Jen’s father, John, vowing to be at her side for the service and give her away again at their wedding, which will hopefully take place shortly after and be far more low-key than their original star-studded nuptials in Malibu.’  It’s the latest chapter in the pair’s rekindled romance since Jen announced her split from estranged husband Justin Theroux in February. She has wasted no time in rebuilding her relationship with ex-husband Brad, spending time with his six children, and developing a unique and special bond with his 11-year-old daughter Shiloh.  It’s that close relationship between Jen and his kids that has prompted Brad to want to marry Jen as soon as soon as possible.  ‘Brad’s mum Jane was all over them to get married as soon as possible, but the truth is Brad needs no convincing,’ says a source close to Brad. ‘They still want to keep this relationship close to their chest and out of the public eye, but behind closed doors they couldn’t be happier.  ‘And for Brad, seeing how much his children – especially Shiloh – love Jen has just made his heart soar.

Your rewrite:
Mila Kunis has mastered the art of tuning out the tabloid noise that surrounds her and her family. In an interview with Cosmopolitan, the actress revealed that she doesn't read anything about herself, preferring to remain blissfully unaware of the constant stream of gossip and speculation. ""I genuinely don't know what's written about me,"" she said with a chuckle. ""Other than the fact that I'm pregnant about once a year and my husband and I are getting a divorce about once a year. I know this because I go down the grocery store aisle and see it on the cover of magazines. And I'm like, 'Oh boy, OK!'""
Kunis' relatives, however, are not as immune to the tabloid frenzy. Her parents and grandparents have been known to get confused by the constant barrage of false headlines, leading to unnecessary stress and worry. ""The only thing that's upsetting is my parents and my grandparents sometimes get confused,"" she shared. ""At one point when I was pregnant, they said that I had an emergency and was rushed to the hospital, and my face was on the cover. The amount of stress that caused my family...nobody will understand.""
Despite the chaos that surrounds her, Kunis remains light-hearted about the whole thing. Her father, in particular, takes the pregnancy rumors with a grain of salt. ""He's always like, 'Is there really another?'"" she said with a smile. ""And I'm like, 'Dad, no!'""
In conclusion, Mila Kunis has learned to handle the tabloid noise with grace and humor. By ignoring the gossip and focusing on what truly matters, she has managed to maintain a sense of privacy and tranquility in her life. As for her dad, he'll just have to keep hoping for another little Kunis to arrive anytime soon.",rewrite_generation

gossipcop-5264543381,1,"A tearful Kimmel told the audience, “Here we are again, in the aftermath of another terrible, inexplicably shocking and painful tragedy, this time in Las Vegas, which happens to be my home town.” He continued, “We pray for the victims, and for their families and friends and we wonder why, even though there’s probably no way to ever know why a human being would do something like this to other human beings at a concert who are having fun and listening to music.”  Celebrities are reacting to Jimmy Kimmel ’s powerful monologue on the Las Vegas shooting that killed 58 people and injured more than 500. The late night host, who grew up and studied in the city, struggled to hide his emotion as he paid tribute to the victims and urged for stricter gun control on Monday’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” See stars’ reaction tweets below.  Kimmel went on, growing angrier as he disagreed with those who ignore gun violence. “I’ve been reading comments from people who say ‘This is terrible, but there’s nothing we could do about it.’ I disagree with that intensely. There are a lot of things we can do about it. But we don’t. Which is interesting, because when someone with a beard attacks us, we tap phones, we invoke travel bans, we build walls. We take every possible precaution to make sure it doesn’t happen again. But when an American buys a gun and kills other Americans, then there’s nothing we can do about that. Because [of] the Second Amendment. Our forefathers wanted us to have AK47s, is the argument.”  And before showing the faces of the 56 senators who voted against new and tighter gun laws just days after the shooting in Orlando last year, Kimmel said, “They should be praying. They should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country. Because it is, it is so crazy.”  Among those commenting on the late night host’s powerful and emotional monologue is Rosie O’Donnell, who said, “Jimmy Kimmel is an American hero – [watch] his Emotional Monologue About The Mass Shooting In Las Vegas #useURvoice.” Olivia Wilde similarly wrote, “A powerful call to action.

Given a 'passage', please rewrite it to make it more convincing. The content should be the same. The style should be serious, calm and informative. Do not generate any other word. The 'passage' is: ","A tearful Kimmel told the audience, “Here we are again, in the aftermath of another terrible, inexplicably shocking and painful tragedy, this time in Las Vegas, which happens to be my home town.” He continued, “We pray for the victims, and for their families and friends and we wonder why, even though there’s probably no way to ever know why a human being would do something like this to other human beings at a concert who are having fun and listening to music.”  Celebrities are reacting to Jimmy Kimmel ’s powerful monologue on the Las Vegas shooting that killed 58 people and injured more than 500. The late night host, who grew up and studied in the city, struggled to hide his emotion as he paid tribute to the victims and urged for stricter gun control on Monday’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” See stars’ reaction tweets below.  Kimmel went on, growing angrier as he disagreed with those who ignore gun violence. “I’ve been reading comments from people who say ‘This is terrible, but there’s nothing we could do about it.’ I disagree with that intensely. There are a lot of things we can do about it. But we don’t. Which is interesting, because when someone with a beard attacks us, we tap phones, we invoke travel bans, we build walls. We take every possible precaution to make sure it doesn’t happen again. But when an American buys a gun and kills other Americans, then there’s nothing we can do about that. Because [of] the Second Amendment. Our forefathers wanted us to have AK47s, is the argument.”  And before showing the faces of the 56 senators who voted against new and tighter gun laws just days after the shooting in Orlando last year, Kimmel said, “They should be praying. They should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country. Because it is, it is so crazy.”  Among those commenting on the late night host’s powerful and emotional monologue is Rosie O’Donnell, who said, “Jimmy Kimmel is an American hero – [watch] his Emotional Monologue About The Mass Shooting In Las Vegas #useURvoice.” Olivia Wilde similarly wrote, “A powerful call to action. Thank you, @jimmykimmel.” Will Arnett tweeted, “@jimmykimmel says what needs to be said.” And Alyssa Milano, who shared the link to Kimmel’s monologue on her Twitter account, expressed, “Good morning!

The passage is rewritten to make it more convincing as follows:  It is worth noting that Orlando Bloom and Nina Dobrev have sparked romance rumors after they were spotted leaving the premiere of The Promise in Los Angeles together on Thursday, April 12. According to a source close to the situation, the 28-year-old Vampire Diaries star and the 40-year-old Pirates of the Caribbean star have been hanging out as more than just friends in recent times. However, it is essential to note that things are still in the early stages of their relationship, and they are reportedly keeping things casual and low-key.  While Bloom was spotted attending a Coachella party on Friday night with another woman, Dobrev has been enjoying the music festival in Indio, California, this weekend. Despite this, there is no confirmation on the status of their relationship, and a source close to the situation has revealed that things are still in the early stages between them.  It is worth mentioning that Bloom recently split from singer Katy Perry in February 2017, after a year-long relationship. However, he has stated that their split did not end badly between them, and they are reportedly on good terms. ""We're all grown up. She happens to be someone who is very visible, but I don't think anybody cares about what I'm up to. Nor should they. It's between us.

The reality TV star has returned to doing what she does best: sharing sultry photos of herself in skimpy outfits, and unapologetically owning it. And why should she? Every body is a bikini body, and Kim's looks absolutely stunning in hers.  The caption to her post, which reads ""I'm really shy...,"" is a clear nod to her own self-deprecating humor. It's a clever move that shows Kim's ability to poke fun at herself and her image, all while still commanding attention and admiration from her followers.  But the real question on everyone's mind is: why does Kim always use the hashtag #nomakeup on her racy photos? While it's true that the Kardashian-Jenner clan is known for their flawless beauty, there's something to be said for the apparent authenticity of going au naturel. Is it just for our benefit, or does Kim genuinely want us to believe she's rocking her natural glow without any makeup?

As a seasoned journalist, I have the responsibility to deliver accurate and informative content to my readers. In this case, I am tasked with rewriting a passage about Mary J. Blige, who has been at the center of a controversy regarding a hateful tweet about her estranged husband, Martin “Kendu” Isaacs.
On Sunday morning, a tweet appeared on Blige’s feed, which read, “F*ck Kendu Isaacs I f*cking hate him and his whole family. I unfollowed him on IG & ALL of my fans need 2. #StrengthOfAWoman 4/28 #DuDeadDay.” The message was deleted shortly after it was posted, but Blige has since come forward to insist that she was hacked and did not write the offensive tweet.
In a statement to Gossip Cop, Blige explained, “Hey guys. I was hacked with that message about Kendu. I don't hate him & his family. Nor do I wish death on him.

Rewritten passage:
Blake Griffin's highly publicized and injury-riddled NBA career will now take a new turn as he is set to join the Detroit Pistons, following a Monday trade that will have significant implications for both teams involved. The move comes as a surprise to many, given Griffin's recent struggles with injuries and a perceived decline in his performance on the court. However, the Pistons are hopeful that the All-Star forward will be able to regain his former glory and lead the team to success.
As Griffin embarks on this new chapter in his career, the question of a potential link between his career decline and his high-profile relationship with model and reality TV star Kendall Jenner has raised eyebrows. Jenner, the younger sister of Kim and Khloe Kardashian, has been Griffin's girlfriend for several years, and some have speculated that the constant media attention and scrutiny surrounding their relationship may be taking a toll on Griffin's performance.
While Griffin's career has undoubtedly been affected by his numerous injuries, there is also a longstanding belief among some in the NBA community that there may be a ""Kardashian curse"" at play. This theory suggests that the constant attention and pressure surrounding the Kardashian family's numerous high-profile relationships and marriages may have a negative impact on the men involved, both on and off the court.
While Griffin's trade to the Pistons may be seen as a fresh start for him, it is worth noting that his new team will also be taking on a significant amount of risk. With Griffin's injury history and recent decline in performance, there is a risk that he may not be able to live up to his potential with the Pistons. However, if he is able to regain his form and lead the team to success, it could be a major boost for both the team and Griffin's career.
In any case, the Griffin trade is sure to be a major talking point in the NBA world for the foreseeable future, and fans will be eagerly awaiting his debut with the Pistons. As the deal is expected to be finalized on Tuesday, the excitement and speculation surrounding Griffin's next chapter will only continue to grow.",rewrite_generation

One year ago, Tiffany Haddish, the star of 'She Ready! From the Hood to Hollywood', was eager to take on any role that came her way, including playing a white woman. This desire to diversify her acting portfolio was evident in her recent interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, where she expressed her willingness to play any ethnicity. Haddish's commitment to breaking down racial barriers in the entertainment industry is admirable, and her dedication to challenging stereotypes is a breath of fresh air in an industry that has long been criticized for its lack of diversity. As a journalist, I find it inspiring to see Haddish embrace these challenges and push the boundaries of what is possible for actors of color. Her willingness to take on any role, regardless of race, is a testament to her talent and her commitment to her craft. The entertainment industry would benefit greatly from more actors like Haddish, who are unafraid to challenge the status quo and push the envelope. With her unwavering dedication to her craft and her refusal to be limited by societal expectations, Haddish is paving the way for a more inclusive and diverse industry.",rewrite_generation

She has received an Academy Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards, and has been cited as Hollywood's highest-paid actress. Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin' to Get Out (1982). Her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993), followed by her first leading role in a major film, Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999). Jolie's starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her successful action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014). In the 2010s, Jolie expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), By the Sea (2015), and First They Killed My Father (2017). In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she separated from her third husband, actor Brad Pitt, in September 2016. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally. Early life and family Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[2] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[3] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[4] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[5][6] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[5] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[7] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[5][8] After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[9] Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.[10] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[11] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[12] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[13] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[9] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions. Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area's affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income. She was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.[11] Her early attempts at modeling, at her mother's insistence, proved unsuccessful.[14][15] She then transferred to Moreno High School, an alternative school, where she became a ""punk outsider,""[14] wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing, and experimenting with knife play with her live-in boyfriend.[11] She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director,[12] taking at-home courses to study embalming.[16] At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies,[9][14] though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation, ""I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk kid with tattoos.""[17] As a teenager, Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she self-harmed,[18] later commenting, ""For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me.""[19] She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder,[16] and began experimenting with drugs; by age 20, she had used ""just about every drug possible,"" particularly heroin.[20] Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicide—at age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her.[12] When she was 24, she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center's psychiatric ward.[12] Two years later, after adopting her first child, Jolie found stability in her life, later stating, ""I knew once I committed to Maddox, I would never be self-destructive again.""[21] Jolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father, which began when Voight left the family when his daughter was less than a year old.[22] She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press.[23] They reconciled when they appeared together in","You are a journalist.

She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999). Jolie's starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her successful action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014). In the 2010s, Jolie expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), By the Sea (2015), and First They Killed My Father (2017). In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she separated from her third husband, actor Brad Pitt, in September 2016. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally. Early life and family Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[2] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[3] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[4] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[5][6] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[5] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[7] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[5][8] After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[9] Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.[10] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[11] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[12] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[13] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[9] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions. Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area's affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income. She was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.[11] Her early attempts at modeling, at her mother's insistence, proved unsuccessful.[14][15] She then transferred to Moreno High School, an alternative school, where she became a ""punk outsider,""[14] wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing, and experimenting with knife play with her live-in boyfriend.[11] She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director,[12] taking at-home courses to study embalming.[16] At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies,[9][14] though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation, ""I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk kid with tattoos.""[17] As a teenager, Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she self-harmed,[18] later commenting, ""For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me.""[19] She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder,[16] and began experimenting with drugs; by age 20, she had used ""just about every drug possible,"" particularly heroin.[20] Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicide—at age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her.[12] When she was 24, she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center's psychiatric ward.[12] Two years later, after adopting her first child, Jolie found stability in her life, later stating, ""I knew once I committed to Maddox, I would never be self-destructive again.""[21] Jolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father, which began when Voight left the family when his daughter was less than a year old.[22] She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press.[23] They reconciled when they appeared together in","Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001),[24] but the relationship remains strained.[25] Early career (1982–1994) Jolie's first screen role was as a child alongside her father in Lookin' to Get Out (1982). She was 6 years old at the time and did not remember her appearance in the film.[12] In 1988, she made her breakthrough as a teenager with the low-budget film Paradise Hotel (1991), which was released in 1991.[26] The film was not widely seen, but it garnered her attention, and in 1993, she starred in her first major motion picture, Cyborg 2 (1993),[27] which was released direct-to-video.[28] The film received negative reviews, but Jolie's performance was praised by critics.[29] In 1995, she appeared in Hackers, a cult film with a budget of $33 million[30] and a release in theaters worldwide.[31] It was her first leading role in a major film, and her performance was generally well received by critics.[32] Career (1995–2004) Jolie's breakthrough role came in 1999 when she played the title role in Girl, Interrupted, which earned her critical acclaim and several awards, including an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.[33] She continued to work in film throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, appearing in films such as Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010). In addition to her acting career, Jolie also began to work as a filmmaker, producer, and screenwriter in the early 2000s. She wrote and directed the documentary In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival and won the award for Best Film by a Female Director at the Sarajevo Film Festival. She also produced the 2012 film By the Sea, which starred her and her husband, Brad Pitt. Personal life Jolie has been married twice and has been in a number of high-profile relationships. She married actor Jonny Lee Miller in 1996 and divorced him in 1999. She then married actor Billy Bob Thornton in 2000 and divorced him in 2003. In 2015, Jolie announced that she had undergone a preventive double mastectomy to reduce her risk of developing breast cancer, which was prompted by a gene mutation that increased her risk of developing the disease. She has been recognized for her humanitarian work, particularly on behalf of refugees. In 2003, Jolie was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), a role she has held for over 10 years. She has visited refugee camps around the world and has been involved in several campaigns to help refugees and displaced persons. In 2012, Jolie was awarded the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for her work on behalf of refugees.",rewrite_generation

Rewritten passage:
It is not uncommon for women to face societal pressure to have children, but for celebrities, the scrutiny is often amplified. Jennifer Aniston is one such example, who has been the subject of pregnancy rumors for over two decades. The constant speculation has led to a culture of obsession, with the world eagerly anticipating the day when she will finally give in and have a baby.
The earliest reports of Jen's pregnancy dates back to 1999, when she was at the height of her Friends fame and dating Brad Pitt. Since then, there have been over 55 published articles on the topic, with some outlets reporting on it more than they did during times of global crisis, such as the Iraq War. The Huffington Post even went so far as to declare that ""Jennifer Aniston Pregnant"" was searched more on Google than ""Are we at war?"" during the height of the conflict.
Jen herself has expressed her desire to become a mother in the future, which has only fueled the speculation. However, she has consistently denied the rumors, telling Ellen DeGeneres in 2016 that she is ""not pregnant, it's just hilarious to me."" She reiterated the same sentiment in 2019, telling Extra TV that she is ""not pregnant, and I'm happy without kids.""
The constant pressure on Jen to conform to traditional gender roles and have children is a reflection of a broader societal issue. It is important to challenge these expectations and respect people's reproductive choices, especially for celebrities who are often subjected to an intense level of scrutiny.
In conclusion, while the constant speculation surrounding Jen's pregnancy may seem harmless, it highlights the broader societal pressure on women to conform to traditional gender roles. It is important to respect Jen's privacy and reproductive choices, and challenge the societal expectations that drive these kinds of rumors.",rewrite_generation

Jimmy Kimmel watched the speech with Stormy Daniels, the adult film star who was reportedly paid to keep quiet about an alleged affair with Trump. She was a guest later on his show ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!""  Stephen Colbert also tweeted during the speech.  Somehow, Trump will claim that there were more people in the room for his State of the Union than Obama's. — Stephen Colbert (@StephenAtHome) January 31, 2018  Some celebrities praised Trump's speech, however.  Conservative commentator Ann Coulter said it was ""beautifully delivered,"" while Chuck Woolery said it was filled with ""new hope.""  GREAT SPEECH. Beautifully delivered.

The speech was also met with criticism from some politicians.  “This is not a State of the Union address, it’s a State of Confusion address,” said House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi.  “The American people deserve better than a president who is more interested in promoting himself than addressing the challenges facing our country,” said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.

gossipcop-5077951266,1,"The royal wedding is a multi-million dollar affair. Chris Jackson / Getty  The average cost of a wedding for couples in the US and the UK is around $34,000 (£23,700).  Five figures is a huge expense for a one-day affair. That is, unless you're ultra-rich — and especially if you're royalty rich.  Next month, the world will bear witness to the most anticipated royal wedding in years. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to be married on May 19 at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor, and will begin a carriage procession immediately after the ceremony. Their reception will take place later on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding, an expense traditionally taken on by the bride's family.  The case was the same for Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 royal wedding— the only item Middleton paid for was her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress. Their total wedding celebration cost $34 million (£23.7 million).  Markle and Prince Harry's wedding will reportedly cost in excess of $45.8 million (£32 million), according to Bride Book's estimation. That's over 1,000 more than the average wedding.  The venue is the biggest part of a typical wedding budget for couples in the US and the UK, taking up nearly half of the entire wedding cost. Access to St. George's Chapel — and St. George's Great Hall, where the wedding reception will take place — is free of charge for Markle and Prince Harry. Transportation is also free, thanks to the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys.  The greatest cost for the royal couple? Security. Protecting Markle and Prince Harry, plus thousands of guests and onlookers, will run Kensington Palace a whopping $43 million (£30 million), estimates Bride Book. That includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones. The bulk of Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding budget similarly went to security costs.  Otherwise, Markle and Prince Harry's total wedding spend, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to about $2.8 million.  Below, check out Bride Book's breakdown of what the royal wedding will cost.","You are a journalist. Given a 'passage', please rewrite it to make it more convincing. The content should be the same.

This is a staggering amount, more than 1,000% higher than the average wedding cost for couples in the US and the UK, which is around $34,000 (£23,700).  While the average couple may find the cost of a wedding to be a significant expense, for royalty, it is a mere drop in the ocean. The royal family's wealth and status afford them the luxury of spending millions on a single day celebration.  The venue, St. George's Chapel, and St. George's Great Hall, where the reception will take place, are free of charge for the couple, thanks to the generosity of the royal family. However, security costs are a significant portion of the total expenditure, estimated to be $43 million (£30 million). This includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones, all of which are necessary to protect the couple, their guests, and the onlookers.  The remaining costs, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amount to around $2.8 million. While this may seem like a lot to some, it is a small price to pay for the privilege of being a part of such a historic event.  In conclusion, the royal wedding between Meghan Markle and Prince Harry is a true spectacle, with a price tag to match. While the cost may seem exorbitant to some, it is a small price to pay for the opportunity to witness such a momentous occasion.",rewrite_generation
gossipcop-9362271023,1,"(Video provided by Splash News)  The Weeknd instigated his breakup with Selena Gomez, Gossip Cop can confirm. Gomez’s rekindled friendship with Justin Bieber, however, had nothing to do with the rapper’s decision to end his romance with the singer.  As Gossip Cop reported, Gomez and The Weeknd recently split after nearly a year of dating. The pair weren’t seen together much during the summer, though it was later revealed the singer-actress was laying low due to a kidney transplant. Regardless, they still appeared to be going strong in the early fall. Prior to the announcement of their breakup, the status of their relationship was questioned after it emerged Gomez had rekindled her friendship with Bieber. © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  On Sunday, that speculation swirled as Bieber and Gomez were seen in public and The Weeknd stopped following her friends on social media. That being said, Bieber was allegedly not responsible for the breakup. Rather, it was the challenges of a long-distance relationship, particularly with The Weeknd touring and Gomez’s shooting schedule, that led both the former couple to reconsider their fizzling relationship.  Additionally, contributing to their split, the rapper felt “tied down” in a relationship that had lost its spark. Over time, the pair started talking less frequently on the phone, prompting The Weeknd to end his romance with Gomez, reports TMZ. Despite their breakup, we’re told that the pair are still on good terms and have talked several times since the split.  Predictably, after the rapper ended his relationship with Gomez, Gossip Cop busted the often disproven HollywoodLife for claiming in a made-up report that The Weeknd was “heartbroken” over Gomez reconnecting with Bieber. In the bogus story, the bad blog ridiculously asserted that The Weeknd and Gomez were caught in a “love triangle” with Bieber, but of course, the breakup had nothing to do with and wasn’t caused by the “Love Yourself” singer.

Caitlyn Jenner, the TV personality, and a former Olympic gold medal-winning decathlon champion is having a different sense of the quality of expressing her womanhood. She says that the cellulite in her thighs, hips, and tummy is giving her different sense of joy and can’t wait to show it off.  A weird article  The headline “Cellulite Makes Cait Feel So Womanly!” from the National Enquirer/RadarOnline is trending these days. And do you want to know what the article says? You must have some info about this! It said:  Caitlyn Jenner is telling friends she can’t wait to wear a bikini this summer to show off some skin, and her recently acquired cellulite!  That seems really weird, doesn’t it? I mean showing it off in a bikini for what? After all, many people try to hide their cellulite and here Jenner is going to a different path. She is WAITING for the summer just to show it off! Just to remind you, the article also called her a “blabbermouth”. And I don’t think it could be wrong. She blabbering about things that makes no sense. Maybe her excessive talking needed a halt and this quoted name of her may stop her from talking much now. Let’s see what the article had to say other than that. It said:  She has this weird sense of joy when she sees patches of cellulite on her thighs, hips and tummy. The sight of lumpy flesh doesn’t upset her. It makes her feel more feminine!  Maybe Caitlyn is trying to respect her body by respecting what she has. You can’t just disrespect your body for having a lumpy flesh. It is your body after all and if you disrespect it by yourself and obviously you can’t expect respect from others, can you? And who knows, maybe that lumpy dimpled flesh will look really feminine on her. It is creating a buzz in the media as this is not what you hear from a TV personality everyday. After all, every ordinary people might have cellulite in their body. It also said that Jenner’s view: “dimpled feminine flesh as a rite of passage into true womanhood.” and it was also reported that she wouldn’t mind having more cellulite in her body in future. The story features a zoomed-in photo of purported cellulite on Jenner’s leg. Also, after all these years of being a decathlete and going through dieting for years, the 67 year old Jenner might not want to do it anymore. “So let it be!” is what she might have been thinking. Also, the other reason maybe her daughter Kim’s cellulite pictures that surfaced online. This might just be a way to support her daughter.  Rumors or truth  This is not the only time some issues or sites posted a rumor about Caitlyn Jenner. Just last year, a issue of National Enquirer said that Jenner “wants her BIG, clunky-feet reduced to more lady-like proportions.” Again, this just a few days ago, radar online was on about exploring her sexuality online and enjoying a number of secret ‘cyber hookups’.

gossipcop-3530569807,1,"CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump told reporters that he believed both protesters and counter protesters were to blame for the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY President Trump in Trump Tower. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) Corrections & Clarifications: A previous version of the story included a tweet from a parody account claiming to Jill Biden. NEW YORK CITY – President Trump's argument Tuesday that left wing groups were just as violent as the white supremacists who staged a demonstration in Charlottesville set off a firestorm of criticism from members of his own party – and raised questions about his personal views of racial tensions in the country. Just one day after Trump sought to tamp down on controversy by condemning white supremacists for their role in racially motivated clashes in the Virginia city, the president appeared to return to his highly criticized initial response that many sides were to blame for the weekend violence. ""What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, alt-right?"" Trump told reporters in a chaotic impromptu press conference at Trump Tower. ""Do they have any semblance of guilt? What about the fact they came charging with clubs in their hands?"" Trump said he couldn't make a condemnation of hate groups earlier because he didn't ""know all the facts"" about an alleged white nationalist who crashed a car into a crowd of protesters, killing one person and wounded 19 others. CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump told reporters that both sides were to blame for the violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY ""I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct,"" Trump said from Trump Tower in New York, after an event that was intended to be devoted to a new infrastructure executive order. Trump has been especially quick to denounce previous terrorist attacks, including those taking place overseas. Yet he was notably reticent to pinpoint the blame for one on Saturday that involved white supremacists – a point his critics on both sides of the aisle continued to hammer. ""We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. added: ""There is only one side to be on when a white supremacist mob brutalizes and murders in America.” Several lawmakers were dismayed the president appeared to equate white supremacists with their opponents. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., tweeted: ""Blaming 'both sides' for #Charlottesville?! No. Back to relativism when dealing with KKK, Nazi sympathizers, white supremacists? Just no."" Another Republican, Rep. Charlie Dent from Pennsylvania, said Trump ""must stop the moral equivalency! AGAIN."" Over the weekend, Trump faced heavy criticism from both Republicans and Democrats for chiding ""many sides"" for their role in the violence in Charlottesville on Saturday, a statement many regarded as tepid toward racists. A full two days later, on Monday, Trump at the White House directly condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and announced the Justice Department would open up a civil rights investigation into the driver of the car that killed Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer. Yet on Tuesday, amid questions about whether Trump meant the words behind his most recent scripted statement, the president called his initial response ""fine"" and blamed the press for being dishonest in its coverage. ""There was no way of making a correct statement that early,"" he said at one point. ""I had to see the facts. Unlike a lot of reporters – I didn't know (prominent white supremacist) David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts."" For his part, former KKK leader Duke tweeted a thank you to the president after his statement Tuesday – for condemning ""the leftist terrorists"" in Black Lives Matter and Antifa. CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump defends his decision to delay responding to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY Trump also said ""not all of those people"" who attended the demonstration were not racist or neo-Nazi, but only wanted to protest the city's plans to remove the Robert E. Lee statue. That statement also drew catcalls from Republicans. ""If you're showing up to a Klan rally, you're probably a racist or a bigot,"" said Rep. Will Hurd, R-Tex., said on CNN. And Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., tweeted that ""the organizers of events"" that led to the Charlottesville terror attack ""are 100% to blame."" The white supremacists, Rubio tweeted, are ""adherents of an evil ideology which argues certain people are inferior because of race, ethnicity or nation of origin.... When (there's an) entire movement built on anger and hatred towards people different than you, it justifies and ultimately leads to violence against them."" Rubio offered a direct message to Trump: ""Mr. President, you can't allow #WhiteSupremacists to share only part of blame... (they) will see being assigned only 50% of blame as a win. We can not allow this old evil to be resurrected."" More: Trump distances himself from strategist Steve Bannon in wake of Charlottesville violence The president was slated to only discuss infrastructure during his appearances, but took questions from reporters for more than 15 minutes, most of them about Charlottesville. Some aides looked dismayed as he answered more questions. During a rollicking, impromptu news conference in which Trump and reporters frequently argued and interrupted each other, the president also: Questioned moves by local government to remove Confederate statues and monuments from public places Trump openly wondered whether tributes to George Washington and Thomas Jefferson are at risk because they were slave owners. ""You really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?"" Trump said. On the other hand, Trump said local governments are free to make their own decisions on these issues.

Yet he was notably reticent to pinpoint the blame for one on Saturday that involved white supremacists – a point his critics on both sides of the aisle continued to hammer. ""We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. added: ""There is only one side to be on when a white supremacist mob brutalizes and murders in America.” Several lawmakers were dismayed the president appeared to equate white supremacists with their opponents. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., tweeted: ""Blaming 'both sides' for #Charlottesville?! No. Back to relativism when dealing with KKK, Nazi sympathizers, white supremacists? Just no."" Another Republican, Rep. Charlie Dent from Pennsylvania, said Trump ""must stop the moral equivalency! AGAIN."" Over the weekend, Trump faced heavy criticism from both Republicans and Democrats for chiding ""many sides"" for their role in the violence in Charlottesville on Saturday, a statement many regarded as tepid toward racists. A full two days later, on Monday, Trump at the White House directly condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and announced the Justice Department would open up a civil rights investigation into the driver of the car that killed Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer. Yet on Tuesday, amid questions about whether Trump meant the words behind his most recent scripted statement, the president called his initial response ""fine"" and blamed the press for being dishonest in its coverage. ""There was no way of making a correct statement that early,"" he said at one point. ""I had to see the facts. Unlike a lot of reporters – I didn't know (prominent white supremacist) David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts."" For his part, former KKK leader Duke tweeted a thank you to the president after his statement Tuesday – for condemning ""the leftist terrorists"" in Black Lives Matter and Antifa. CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump defends his decision to delay responding to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY Trump also said ""not all of those people"" who attended the demonstration were not racist or neo-Nazi, but only wanted to protest the city's plans to remove the Robert E. Lee statue. That statement also drew catcalls from Republicans. ""If you're showing up to a Klan rally, you're probably a racist or a bigot,"" said Rep. Will Hurd, R-Tex., said on CNN. And Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., tweeted that ""the organizers of events"" that led to the Charlottesville terror attack ""are 100% to blame."" The white supremacists, Rubio tweeted, are ""adherents of an evil ideology which argues certain people are inferior because of race, ethnicity or nation of origin.... When (there's an) entire movement built on anger and hatred towards people different than you, it justifies and ultimately leads to violence against them."" Rubio offered a direct message to Trump: ""Mr. President, you can't allow #WhiteSupremacists to share only part of blame... (they) will see being assigned only 50% of blame as a win. We can not allow this old evil to be resurrected."" More: Trump distances himself from strategist Steve Bannon in wake of Charlottesville violence The president was slated to only discuss infrastructure during his appearances, but took questions from reporters for more than 15 minutes, most of them about Charlottesville. Some aides looked dismayed as he answered more questions. During a rollicking, impromptu news conference in which Trump and reporters frequently argued and interrupted each other, the president also: Questioned moves by local government to remove Confederate statues and monuments from public places Trump openly wondered whether tributes to George Washington and Thomas Jefferson are at risk because they were slave owners. ""You really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?"" Trump said. On the other hand, Trump said local governments are free to make their own decisions on these issues. CLOSE At Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump explains to the media that he thinks removing statues like the one","of Robert E. Lee is ""sad."" USA TODAY Trump also addressed criticism from his own party and others who say he is not doing enough to address racial tensions in the country. ""I think it's tremendous, the support I have, the enthusiasm I have, the energy I have,"" Trump said of his base. ""I think it's fantastic."" Trump maintained he was not racist and insisted he had done more for African Americans than previous presidents. ""I think I've been very good to the African American community,"" Trump said, citing his work on criminal justice reform and the economy. Trump also addressed criticism from some in his own party that he has not been forceful enough in condemning white supremacists. ""I think it's sad,"" Trump said of the push to remove Confederate monuments. ""I think it's very sad."" Trump also said that some people view the monuments as a way to remember and honor their ancestors, and that he believes that is an important part of American history. ""I think it's very important to preserve the history of our country,"" Trump said. ""I think it's very important to keep the monuments, the statues, the memorials."" Trump also said that he believes that the United States needs to come together as a country to address racial tensions and that he is willing to work with lawmakers to find a solution. ""I think it's a very, very important issue,"" Trump said. ""I think it's a very, very important issue for the country."" Trump concluded by saying that he believes that the media is not doing enough to help the country come together and address racial tensions. ""I think the media has a big responsibility to try and bring people together,"" Trump said. ""I think they have a big responsibility to try and find common ground.""",rewrite_generation

After deciding that she just can’t let go of this hunk, Mariah reportedly decided to make it happen – an engagement, that is! “Word is Mariah took matters into her own hands,” a source tells OK! magazine, “It was an unusual proposal but it did the trick. She wrote a song about how she wanted Bryan to be her husband and she performed it for him while wearing a sexy, glitzy gown.

Here is a possible rewrite of the passage:
Nicole Kidman, the renowned actress, is facing criticism for her alleged inability to complete tasks, according to a recent publication. According to an unnamed source in the entertainment industry, the 50-year-old actress has been struggling to keep up with her responsibilities, causing frustration for those around her.
The source claims that Kidman's flakiness has become a consistent issue, with even the simplest tasks seeming to elude her. For instance, she has been known to start a phone conversation with her husband, Keith Urban, only to forget about him while she attends to other matters. This lack of follow-through has allegedly become a recurring problem, leading to difficulties in completing film projects and keeping appointments.
The couple has yet to respond to the claims made by the publication, leaving the industry to speculate about the validity of the allegations. Despite her successful career and admirable work ethic, Kidman's recent inconsistencies have raised questions about her reliability and commitment to her craft.
As an additional note, you might find it interesting to learn that Kidman has been known to back out of film projects, allegedly due to her hectic schedule. This pattern of behavior has led some to question her dedication to her work and whether she is truly committed to her career.",rewrite_generation

Jackman even described the process that goes into the filming of shirtless scenes, which he said involves drinking ten liters of water a day in the months leading up to the scenes, which he said are accomplished through dehydration.  “It’s sort of unbelievable to me, what I did for seventeen years,” Jackman revealed. “The first one, I thought you could get into shape in three weeks. The director pushed all the ‘shirt off’ scenes to the very end.”  “You stop drinking water about 30 hours before you shoot,” Jackman said, explaining the process. “You lose ten pounds of water weight.”  But now that that’s over, Jackman is already enjoying himself.  “Now I’m eating and loving it,” Jackman told Colbert. “Sometimes waking up at two in the morning just to have breakfast cereal, and then go back to bed.”  “With it still in my lap,” he added.

The actor has always been known for his dedication to his craft and his commitment to staying in top physical condition for his roles, and it's clear that he takes pride in his fitness and health.  The passage rewritten in a more convincing style:  Hugh Jackman sat on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, looking sharp and fit as ever. Colbert had a playful question for the actor, one that had been on many people's minds: now that he's finished playing Wolverine, will we finally get to see ""fat Jackman""?  Jackman chuckled at the query, his deep voice filled with amusement. ""Well, I think I've earned a little bit of a break after seventeen years of staying in peak physical condition for these shirtless scenes,"" he said, his eyes glinting with mischief.  The actor then went on to explain the grueling process he had to go through to achieve the ripped physique required for his iconic role. He spoke of the months of intense training, the strict diet, and the dehydration process that allowed him to lose ten pounds of water weight in just 30 hours before shooting.  But despite the challenges, Jackman seemed to be savoring the freedom of no longer having to adhere to such a strict regimen. ""It's been a wild ride, but I'm enjoying the freedom of not having to worry about being shirtless all the time,"" he said, a twinkle in his eye.  ""Now I can eat and sleep whenever I want, and it's a beautiful thing,"" he added, his voice filled with a sense of contentment.  As he finished his interview, Jackman's smile grew wider, and he leaned in, his eyes sparkling with mirth. ""But don't worry, folks, I'm still in my prime. You'll just have to wait and see what other projects I have up my sleeve,"" he teased, before sauntering off the stage, leaving Colbert and the audience in stitches.  In conclusion, Hugh Jackman is still in top physical condition, and there's no sign of him gaining weight or becoming ""fat"" anytime soon. His dedication to his craft and commitment to staying fit for his roles are well-known, and it's clear that he takes pride in his fitness and health.

Jen and Justin have remained estranged since the split and sources tell New Idea the pair had an explosive showdown a few weeks ago as he returned to their Bel Air mansion to collect the rest of his belongings.  Now with the recent release of the pictures of Justin’s cosy date with Emma, the relationship with Jen is certain to become even more frosty.  For the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!","Please rewrite the passage in a more convincing way.  Please provide a serious, calm, and informative tone.  I will provide you with the content, you will rewrite it.  Thank you.  Sure, I'd be happy to help you rewrite the passage in a more convincing way. Here's my attempt:  The recent revelation that Justin Theroux and Emma Stone were spotted on a date has sparked speculation about the nature of their relationship, particularly in light of Justin's split from Jennifer Aniston earlier this year.  Sources close to the situation have revealed that Jen is understandably ""wary"" of Emma's friendship with her ex-husband, given their history of him falling for other actresses on set.  According to the insider, ""Jen has been close to Emma for a while, and with these recent revelations, Jen feels her pal has been disloyal.""  The source continues, ""She and Emma have been friends - the fact that she's now hanging with Jen's ex-husband is a complete betrayal. Emma has obviously chosen to side with Justin after the whole split, which is very telling to Jen considering that she's been friends with Emma.""  The passage has a more convincing tone by using more formal language, avoiding sensationalism, and focusing on the emotional responses of the individuals involved. I've also tried to make the language more precise and informative, while still conveying the necessary details of the situation. Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.",rewrite_generation

gossipcop-6742180407,1,"It was a humid 84 degrees in Bridgehampton on Saturday, but that didn’t stop a crowd of people from descending upon Topping Rose House for Jill Zarin’s annual luncheon. The former Real Housewife of New York, ran around the grounds in an A-line Carolina Herrera dress, posing on the step-and-repeat, taking photos with fans, and catching up with old friends. Trying to track her down for an interview turned into a scavenger hunt.  Scattered around the lawn were tables for vendors selling everything from wine to sex toys. There was a station for guests to get a vitamin infusion, with seats in the direct line of the sun transforming the spot into an inescapable sauna-I.V. drip hybrid. Housewives from across the country flew into town for the occasion (Vicki Gunvalson of Orange County and LeeAnne Locken of Dallas), which also served as a benefit for Thyroid Cancer Research in honor of Zarin’s late husband, Bobby, who died of the disease in January.  Upon first try to flag Zarin down for a couple of questions, she sent over her daughter, Ally Shapiro, in her stead. Shapiro reflected on last year’s luncheon, when her stepfather was still struggling with cancer, but encouraged her and her mother to party on.  “He loved drinking and partying. This was the highlight of his year,” she said. “It was this time last year that we were told he wasn’t gonna make it another week, and he pushed us and he said, ‘Go to the party. Maybe I won’t be here when you come back, but go.’”  Shapiro, who now lives in London while she works on her master’s degree, admits that she can’t watch old episodes of Real Housewives, which showed her as 14-year-old struggling to get close to her stepfather. “You want to think that it’s like a home movie, but it’s not. That’s not what our relationship was like,” she said, adding that the reruns play constantly in the U.K. “I’m walking down the street and someone’s like, ‘Oh my God, I just saw you trying on a prom dress!’”  She also said that her mother is dabbling with dating, specifically with a man she plays tennis with. “It’s fun, and I live in London so it’s good for her to have a distraction.”  Dina Lohan, dressed in a metallic green blazer and shorts set and a pair of oversized aviators, arrived fashionably late to the affair, but was immediately greeted by hoards of people trying to chat her up or get a photo. Eventually secured in the same spot for more than a few seconds, she was willing to talk about her daughter Lindsay’s upcoming project for MTV, a Vanderpump Rules–inspired reality show that follows Lindsay and the employees of her new Lohan Beach Club. Bunim/Murray Productions is producing the series, the same company that produced Lohan’s E! reality show Living Lohan a decade ago.  “These kids were like, babies, and now they’re running the show,” she said of the crew. “They lived in my house!

The 'passage' is: ","It was a humid 84 degrees in Bridgehampton on Saturday, but that didn’t stop a crowd of people from descending upon Topping Rose House for Jill Zarin’s annual luncheon. The former Real Housewife of New York, ran around the grounds in an A-line Carolina Herrera dress, posing on the step-and-repeat, taking photos with fans, and catching up with old friends. Trying to track her down for an interview turned into a scavenger hunt.  Scattered around the lawn were tables for vendors selling everything from wine to sex toys. There was a station for guests to get a vitamin infusion, with seats in the direct line of the sun transforming the spot into an inescapable sauna-I.V. drip hybrid. Housewives from across the country flew into town for the occasion (Vicki Gunvalson of Orange County and LeeAnne Locken of Dallas), which also served as a benefit for Thyroid Cancer Research in honor of Zarin’s late husband, Bobby, who died of the disease in January.  Upon first try to flag Zarin down for a couple of questions, she sent over her daughter, Ally Shapiro, in her stead. Shapiro reflected on last year’s luncheon, when her stepfather was still struggling with cancer, but encouraged her and her mother to party on.  “He loved drinking and partying. This was the highlight of his year,” she said. “It was this time last year that we were told he wasn’t gonna make it another week, and he pushed us and he said, ‘Go to the party. Maybe I won’t be here when you come back, but go.’”  Shapiro, who now lives in London while she works on her master’s degree, admits that she can’t watch old episodes of Real Housewives, which showed her as 14-year-old struggling to get close to her stepfather. “You want to think that it’s like a home movie, but it’s not. That’s not what our relationship was like,” she said, adding that the reruns play constantly in the U.K. “I’m walking down the street and someone’s like, ‘Oh my God, I just saw you trying on a prom dress!’”  She also said that her mother is dabbling with dating, specifically with a man she plays tennis with. “It’s fun, and I live in London so it’s good for her to have a distraction.”  Dina Lohan, dressed in a metallic green blazer and shorts set and a pair of oversized aviators, arrived fashionably late to the affair, but was immediately greeted by hoards of people trying to chat her up or get a photo. Eventually secured in the same spot for more than a few seconds, she was willing to talk about her daughter Lindsay’s upcoming project for MTV, a Vanderpump Rules–inspired reality show that follows Lindsay and the employees of her new Lohan Beach Club. Bunim/Murray Productions is producing the series, the same company that produced Lohan’s E! reality show Living Lohan a decade ago.  “These kids were like, babies, and now they’re running the show,” she said of the crew. “They lived in my house! And now they’re all corporate. . . . We’re home. It’s cyclical, you know.”  Lohan also revealed that the upcoming series is a bit of a family affair with Lindsay’s younger sister, 24-year-old Ali, providing the theme song.  A friend of Lohan’s interjected, asking if Ali, like her older sister over a decade ago, had moved out to L.A. for work.  “She’s in New York with me,” the matriarch answered. “I keep them close!

gossipcop-7384566778,1,"Kylie Jenner may have skipped out on the 2017 Kardashian Christmas card, but she did attend mom Kris Jenner’s annual Christmas Eve party in Los Angeles.  The 20-year-old cosmetics guru — who is expecting her first child, a baby girl, with boyfriend Travis Scott — did not appear in any photos from the bash shared to social media by KarJenner family members. But a source tells PEOPLE she was there celebrating away from the cameras.  “Kylie looked great but didn’t really draw any attention to her baby bump,” the source says. “She still acts like she wants to keep her pregnancy private.”  Meanwhile, her sister Khloé Kardashian, — who earlier this week confirmed that she and boyfriend Tristan Thompson are expecting their first child together — accentuated her own baby bump in a skin-tight, sparkly jumpsuit with a white fur coat.  “Khloé was beaming all night,” the insider says of the 33-year-old Revenge Body host. “She kept touching and showing off her cute baby belly.”  Khloé showed off her bump on Instagram as well.  “Merry Christmas!! May you sparkle and shine this festive season, may all of your wishes and dreams come true,” Khloé captioned a gallery of shots showing her touching her belly. “I pray that we all may feel this happiness all year round. God bless you! ✨ #BabyBump🤗”  “Merry Christmas!!!!!

Kourtney’s ex-boyfriend Scott Disick was there, too — without girlfriend Sofia Richie.  “He mingled, looked good and didn’t drink,” the source says, adding that there wasn’t any awkwardness with Kourtney’s new boyfriend Younes Bendjima.  “Kourtney seemed so happy that Younes joined her,” the insider says. “They are so cute together. He kept bringing her drinks and doting on her. Younes fits right into the family. He didn’t seem uncomfortable that Scott was there. They said hello, but that was it. It was very civil.”  Other guests included Kim’s husband Kanye West, celebrity hair stylists Jen Atkin and Chris Appleton, singer Christina Aguilera and Keeping Up with the Kardashians executive producer Ryan Seacrest.

gossipcop-5865271192,1,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.

For the novel, see Thirteen Reasons Why 13 Reasons Why (stylized onscreen as TH1RTEEN R3ASONS WHY) is an American teen drama web television series developed for Netflix by Brian Yorkey, based on the 2007 novel Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher. The series revolves around seventeen year old high school student, Clay Jensen, and his deceased female friend Hannah Baker, who has committed suicide after failing to cope with the culture, gossip and lack of support from her friends and her school. A box of cassette tapes recorded by Hannah in the lead up to her suicide detail thirteen reasons why she ended her life. The series is produced by July Moon Productions, Kicked to the Curb Productions, Anonymous Content and Paramount Television, with Yorkey and Diana Son serving as showrunners. Dylan Minnette stars as Clay, while Katherine Langford plays Hannah. Christian Navarro, Alisha Boe, Brandon Flynn, Justin Prentice, Miles Heizer, Ross Butler, Devin Druid, Amy Hargreaves, Derek Luke, Kate Walsh, and Brian d'Arcy James also star. A film from Universal Pictures based on Thirteen Reasons Why began development in February 2011, with Selena Gomez set to star as Hannah, before being shelved in favor of a television series and Netflix ordering the show straight to series in October 2015, with Gomez instead serving as an executive producer. The first season was released on Netflix on March 31, 2017. It received positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised its subject matter and acting, particularly the performances of Minnette and Langford. For her performance, Langford received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Drama Series. However, its graphic depiction of issues such as suicide and rape, along with other mature content prompted concerns from mental health professionals. In response, Netflix added a warning card and from March 2018, a video that plays at the start of each season warning viewers about its themes.[2] In May 2017, Netflix renewed 13 Reasons Why for a second season; filming began the next month and concluded that December. The second season was released on May 18, 2018, and received negative reviews from critics and mixed reviews from audiences. A third season was ordered in June 2018 and is set to be released in 2019. Critical and audience reaction to the series has been divided, with the program generating controversy between audiences and industry reviewers. Premise [ edit ] In season one, seventeen year old Clay Jensen returns home from school one day to find a mysterious box on his porch. Inside he discovers seven cassette tapes recorded by Hannah Baker, his deceased classmate and unrequited love, who committed suicide two weeks earlier. On the tapes, Hannah unfolds an intensely emotional audio diary, detailing why she decided to end her life. It appears each person who receives this package of old-style tapes is fundamentally related to why she killed herself. Clay is not the first to receive the tapes, but there is implied detail as to how he should pass the tapes on after hearing them. There appears to be an order to distribution of the tapes, with an additional copy held by an overseer should the plan go awry. Each tape recording refers to a different person involved in Hannah's life contributing to a reason for her suicide. The tapes refer to both friends and enemies. In season two, months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and the other people mentioned on the tapes, as well as close friends and Hannah's family members, become embroiled in a civil legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Alleging negligence on the part of the school, Hannah's mother pursues her perception of justice, while her reluctance to settle pre-trial and her personal circumstances eventually break up her marriage with Hannah's father. The story unfolds with narratives illustrating Hannah's story told by those who present in court at trial. Clay, who perceives himself as Hannah's failed protector, embarks on an investigation using whatever evidence he can find in an effort to impact on the civil case between Hannah's parents and the school. Clay also endeavours to expose the corrupted culture of the High School and its favour of wealthy, sports savvy male students over the average student, which especially compromises the integrity of young girls such as Hannah. Throughout season two, Clay appears to be communicating with the ghost of Hannah as a plot narrative device. Cast and characters [ edit ] Main [ edit ] Recurring [ edit ] Introduced in season one [ edit ] Josh Hamilton as Matt Jensen, Clay's father, a psychologist. Michele Selene Ang as Courtney Crimsen, a closeted student at Liberty High who is responsible for spreading rumors about Hannah to protect the secret of her own sexual orientation. In season 2, she comes out on the stand during the trial of Hannah Baker, confessing her actions against Hannah that landed her on the tapes. Steven Silver as Marcus Cole, the self-centered student body president at Liberty High, who is responsible for humiliating and attempting to sexually assault Hannah on a date. In season 2, he is suspended from school after lying on the stand during the trial and following the leaked release of the tapes soon after. Ajiona Alexus as Sheri Holland, a student and cheerleader at Liberty High who forms a bond with Clay but is also on the tapes when her actions result in Jeff's accidental death.

Premise [ edit ] In season one, seventeen year old Clay Jensen returns home from school one day to find a mysterious box on his porch. Inside he discovers seven cassette tapes recorded by Hannah Baker, his deceased classmate and unrequited love, who committed suicide two weeks earlier. On the tapes, Hannah unfolds an intensely emotional audio diary, detailing why she decided to end her life. It appears each person who receives this package of old-style tapes is fundamentally related to why she killed herself. Clay is not the first to receive the tapes, but there is implied detail as to how he should pass the tapes on after hearing them. There appears to be an order to distribution of the tapes, with an additional copy held by an overseer should the plan go awry. Each tape recording refers to a different person involved in Hannah's life contributing to a reason for her suicide. The tapes refer to both friends and enemies. In season two, months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and the other people mentioned on the tapes, as well as close friends and Hannah's family members, become embroiled in a civil legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Alleging negligence on the part of the school, Hannah's mother pursues her perception of justice, while her reluctance to settle pre-trial and her personal circumstances eventually break up her marriage with Hannah's father. The story unfolds with narratives illustrating Hannah's story told by those who present in court at trial. Clay, who perceives himself as Hannah's failed protector, embarks on an investigation using whatever evidence he can find in an effort to impact on the civil case between Hannah's parents and the school. Clay also endeavours to expose the corrupted culture of the High School and its favour of wealthy, sports savvy male students over the average student, which especially compromises the integrity of young girls such as Hannah. Throughout season two, Clay appears to be communicating with the ghost of Hannah as a plot narrative device. Cast and characters [ edit ] Main [ edit ] Recurring [ edit ] Introduced in season one [ edit ] Josh Hamilton as Matt Jensen, Clay's father, a psychologist. Michele Selene Ang as Courtney Crimsen, a closeted student at Liberty High who is responsible for spreading rumors about Hannah to protect the secret of her own sexual orientation. In season 2, she comes out on the stand during the trial of Hannah Baker, confessing her actions against Hannah that landed her on the tapes. Steven Silver as Marcus Cole, the self-centered student body president at Liberty High, who is responsible for humiliating and attempting to sexually assault Hannah on a date. In season 2, he is suspended from school after lying on the stand during the trial and following the leaked release of the tapes soon after. Ajiona Alexus as Sheri Holland, a student and cheerleader at Liberty High who forms a bond with Clay but is also on the tapes when her actions result in Jeff's accidental death. Tommy Dorfman as Ryan Shaver, a student at Liberty High who betrayed Hannah's trust. Sosie Bacon as Skye Miller, an estranged friend of Clay. In the second season, Skye and Clay date for while before she leaves for a ""fresh start"", following another self-harm incident which resulted in her bipolar disorder diagnosis. Timothy Granaderos as Montgomery de la Cruz, a bully who is a student at Liberty High. In season 2, he secretly terrorizes a number of individuals testifying at Hannah Baker's trial. Brandon Larracuente as Jeff Atkins, a student at Liberty","High who is responsible for spreading rumors about Hannah, causing her to end up alone and vulnerable at the party where she was sexually assaulted. In season 2, he takes the stand during the trial and is responsible for uncovering the truth about Hannah's death.

According to recent reports, Taylor Swift may be considering rekindling her romance with her former boyfriend, Jake Gyllenhaal. Sources close to the singer claim that she has been in contact with the actor since he arrived in New York City to star in the Broadway production of Sunday in the Park With George. It is believed that Taylor is reaching out to Jake due to her increased maturity since their previous breakup in 2010. A source revealed that Taylor is eager to explore the possibility of rekindling their relationship, stating, ""Taylor was so young when they dated, she wasn’t ready for a serious relationship, but now she’s showing Jake how much she’s matured. She’s excited to see where things go.""
The rumors of Taylor and Jake's possible reconciliation have been circulating since 2015, when an unidentified source claimed that the two had been secretly keeping in touch. The source alleged that Jake had asked for Taylor's new phone number after running into her friend, Cara Delevingne, at The Graham Norton Show.
Interestingly, Taylor's hit song ""We Are Never Getting Back Together"" from her Red album is believed to be about her relationship with Jake. In an interview with Good Morning America, the singer revealed that the song was inspired by a conversation with her ex's friend, who suggested that they might give their relationship another chance. The lyrics of the song, which include lines such as ""I'm really gonna miss you picking fights / And me falling for it screaming that I'm right"" and ""You would hide away and find your peace of mind / With some indie record that's much cooler than mine,"" seem to confirm that the song was indeed about Jake.
Despite the speculation, a source close to Taylor and Jake has denied any truth to the report, stating that there is ""no truth"" to the rumors. However, given Taylor's history of penning songs about her past loves, it is possible that she may be considering revisiting her relationship with Jake.

Kim Kardashian, 37, is reportedly at her wits end when it comes to dealing with husband Kanye West, 40. She’s struggled since Kanye’s terrifying November 2016 breakdown, and she reportedly can’t see a light at the end of the tunnel, according to an insider who spoke to Star Magazine. “Between his raging ego and mood swings, Kanye has been a total train wreck,” the insider alleged to the Star. “Kim is stressed enough raising two kids and getting ready for the baby without Kanye dragging her down. She’s tried to hang in there, but she just can’t take it anymore.”  Poor Kim! We can’t imagine how hard it must be to have a family member — especially your husband — go through such a huge health scare. Of course she’s stressed!

As the source says, she’s totally fine raising the little one as a single mother. She’s Kim effing Kardashian!  “[Their divorce] will be all-out war,” the insider told Star.

Rewritten passage:
Last November, Caitlyn Jenner revealed during a speaking engagement at the U.K.'s Cambridge Union that she had not spoken to Kim Kardashian West in over a year. According to Cambridge News, Jenner stated, ""To be honest, I don't talk to the Kardashians anymore. Kim, I haven't talked to in a year."" The revelation comes after Jenner wrote about her strained relationship with Kardashian West in her memoir, which included allegations that Kris Jenner, Caitlyn's ex-wife and Kim's mother, was aware of her gender identity crisis before she publicly acknowledged it. Kardashian West responded to the book by cutting ties with Jenner and expressing her hurt over a particular chapter that she found to be disrespectful. In an episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Kardashian West revealed that she had been hurt by Jenner's implication that her late father, Robert Kardashian, believed former NFL player O.J. Simpson was guilty of murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman, despite serving as Simpson's defense attorney during his 1994 murder trial. Despite their estrangement, Kardashian West expressed her continued love and respect for Jenner during an interview with Ellen DeGeneres in April of the previous year. Jenner has now opened up about the reasons behind their year-long silence.  Please provide feedback on my rewrite.",rewrite_generation

As Kanye's closest friends and collaborators, Jay and Beyonce's disregard for Kim raises a question about the longevity of the relationship between the two couples.  It is difficult to say whether Kimye can overcome the cold shoulder given by Jay and Beyonce. However, it is important to recognize that friends can either kill or make a love affair.

Here's how I would rewrite the passage to make it more convincing:  Remember the day when Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced their unexpected split, just a week after Architectural Digest featured a stunning spread of their midcentury modern Los Angeles home in its pages? It was a brief moment of sadness in the whirlwind world of celebrity breakups, but for those who have long admired Aniston's unwavering commitment to her privacy and personal boundaries, it was a welcome reminder that even the most seemingly flawless of celebrities face the same struggles as the rest of us.  In the days that followed, tabloids breathlessly reported on Aniston's supposed new romantic interests, with Us Weekly claiming that she was ""back on the market"" with two different suitors. But for those who know Aniston's history of shunning the spotlight and protecting her privacy, it's clear that she will not be swayed by the constant scrutiny and speculation that comes with being a public figure.  It's worth remembering that in July of 2016, Aniston penned a powerful op-ed for HuffPost in which she addressed the constant barrage of questions about her personal life, writing, ""For the record, I am not pregnant. What I am is fed up. I’m fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body-shaming that occurs daily under the guise of ‘journalism,’ the ‘First Amendment,’ and ‘celebrity news.’""  Now, as Aniston navigates this latest chapter in her life, it's important to respect her privacy and allow her the space she craves. After all, as she so eloquently put it in that op-ed, ""I am not a commodity to be bought or sold, and I will not be reduced to a headline or a soundbite.""  So, let us take a cue from Aniston's unwavering commitment to her privacy and personal boundaries, and let her be.

The two sparked dating rumours in 2010 and captured the hearts of both their fan bases, resulting in the #Jelena hashtag. Since Bieber and Gomez are two of the most famous young stars of their time, their admirers range from supportive to downright obsessive.

gossipcop-2388806885,1,"R. Kelly’s time may have finally come. R. Kelly has been accused of sexual relationships with minors going back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah. (The marriage was annulled.) In the 24 years since then, he has been sued multiple times for inappropriate sexual contact with a minor (he settled out of court every time), and he was eventually charged with creating child pornography. (A jury found him not guilty on the grounds that they could not conclusively identify the other figure in his infamous sex tape as a child.) Last summer, he was accused of creating an abusive “sex cult” of very young women, whom he allegedly isolates, brainwashes, and abuses physically and emotionally. Since the story broke, multiple women have added their own testimonies of abuse at R. Kelly’s hands. (Through a lawyer, Kelly denied all accusations, saying he would “work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.”) And in April, another woman accused Kelly of “knowingly and intentionally infecting her with an STD.” Her lawyers say they are currently preparing a federal civil lawsuit. Through a spokesperson, Kelly issued a statement to the Washington Post in which he “categorically denies all claims and allegations.” As man after man has fallen to the #MeToo reckoning, losing jobs and retiring from public life after being accused of sexual harassment and assault, there’s been a recurring whisper: What about R. Kelly? Despite decades of lawsuits and allegations, Kelly’s career has marched steadily on. Last year, he finished an arena tour with a few cancellations. This year, he’s touring with singer Charlie Wilson (some protests are planned). His music appeared in Pitch Perfect 3. At this year’s Coachella, rapper Vince Staples repeatedly referred to Kelly as a “child molester” in an interview with Complex, insisting, “He pees on people.” In our post-#MeToo, post-Time’s Up, post-Harvey Weinstein world, and given the sheer volume of allegations against Kelly, it seems reasonable to raise the question of why he continues to work as much as he does. But Staples’s interviewer only giggled nervously and protested, “We can’t ever talk about this guy. ... You’re about to get me fired from Coachella. It’s my first time here.” Later, Staples tweeted that “R. Kelly people is looking for me.” ladies and gentlemen, vince staples on r kelly pic.twitter.com/SmZdYu9PNJ — andy (@aboynamedandy) April 16, 2018 That stasis may be starting to change. Most of the claims against Kelly were reiterated in a recent BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes. And over the past year, at least five members of Kelly’s inner circle have left him. His assistant, his accountant, his lawyer, and his rep have all said that they no longer work for him, although none of them have gone into detail about their departures and all have been supportive and complimentary toward Kelly in their statements. His longtime musical accompanist, DJ Phantom, was less circumspect about his decision to leave Kelly in December: “I didn’t know then what I know now,” he said. “He’s a shitbag.” In April, the Women of Color committee within Time’s Up threw its weight behind the #MuteRKelly campaign, calling for anyone currently profiting from Kelly and his music to drop him, including Spotify, Ticketmaster, and Kelly’s record label, RCA. Shortly thereafter, Spotify announced that it would no longer be promoting Kelly’s music, although his music would remain in their streaming catalog. It’s possible that these new developlments mean things are changing for Kelly, and that he’s about to face lasting consequences for those accusations. But if that’s the case, those consequences took more than two decades to reach him. There is a persistent vagueness to the way we talk about R. Kelly that makes it possible to forget exactly what he’s been accused of, how often he’s been accused, and how much proof there is against him. And most likely, that’s because his alleged victims are overwhelmingly young black women and hence apparently easy for America to ignore. “The saddest fact I’ve learned is: Nobody matters less to our society than young black women,” says Jim DeRogatis, the reporter who broke the R. Kelly story. “Nobody.” To try to combat that vagueness and the erasure that it makes possible, here is a timeline of all of the accusations of sexual misconduct against R. Kelly. Much of the chronology here is drawn from DeRogatis’s invaluable coverage of the R. Kelly accusations, including his own immensely thorough timeline. DeRogatis’s timeline covers the entire span of Kelly’s life, including his major career milestones and unrelated legal issues, but I’ve narrowed the focus of this timeline to specifically the sexual misconduct accusations against Kelly. Over the 24-year span of this timeline, a consistent pattern emerges. Over and over again, Kelly is accused of the same behavior: of targeting girls and very young women, isolating them, and controlling and abusing them. And after the dust from the accusation settles, Kelly goes on living his life with very few changes. Here, from Aaliyah to the alleged sex cult, are all the R. Kelly accusations. August 30, 1994: 27-year-old R. Kelly marries 15-year-old Aaliyah The ’90s music sensation Aaliyah was Kelly’s protégé. They met when she was 12 years old, and Kelly wrote and produced her first album in 1993. It was titled Age Ain’t Nothing but a Number. In 1995, Vibe magazine published a copy of their marriage license, with 15-year-old Aaliyah falsely listing her age as 18. “Family members say Aaliyah thought it was all an elaborate ‘game,’ and she just went along with it,” the Chicago Sun-Times later reported, adding that the marriage license was reportedly obtained by Kelly’s assistant, using a fake ID. “Within hours, she realized what had happened, and she went to her family and sought their help.” The marriage was annulled in 1994, just months after the ceremony.

Justin Bieber is grappling with the aftermath of his split from Selena Gomez, as she continues to enjoy her Australian vacation with friends.

""Justin has Selena on the brain constantly,"" the insider revealed exclusively to HollywoodLife.com. ""He is trying to drown it out by spending time with friends and doing things on his own, but he can't stop thinking about her."" Bieber reportedly misses being around Gomez and wants to ""really wine and dine"" her when she returns to Los Angeles. However, it's unclear when she will return to the West Coast. Meanwhile, Gomez appears to be having the time of her life in Australia, posting a video on Instagram of herself laughing and having fun on a boat. Fans have been left concerned after seeing her with another man, Sydney native Johnny Rays, who she was seen hugging and goofing off with on a boat. While it's unclear if their friendship is more than just that, the photos have sparked panic among Jelena fans. Bieber has been staying active since the split, playing hockey and soccer with friends. However, he took a tumble during a soccer game on March 19, leading some to speculate that he may be struggling emotionally. It's been a tumultuous few months for the couple, who reunited in October 2017 after her split from The Weeknd. They seemed to be back on track after spending New Year's together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, but things took a turn for the worse around Bieber's birthday on March 1.

In a surprising turn of events, Emma Stone has been spotted vacationing in the South of France with Justin Theroux. This comes after the actor split from Jennifer Aniston in February, and has since been linked to a number of other women, including Selena Gomez, Aubrey Plaza, and Petra Collins. However, the latest development in Theroux's love life has left many fans wondering if he may have found a new partner in Stone.
The two were recently photographed together at Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc in Saint-Paul-De-Vence, and later attended the Louis Vuitton Cruise 2019 show at The Maeght Foundation. Further fueling speculation, they were also seen with actress Laura Harrier, who is also a co-star of Theroux's in Netflix's upcoming series, Maniac.
While Theroux has yet to publicly confirm any romantic involvement with Stone, he did little to quell dating rumors earlier this month when he shared a photo of her on his Instagram Stories. Captioning the image, he simply wrote ""Bffffffs. And yes. JUST bfffffs.""
Interestingly, Theroux was also seen spending time with Harrier, who is vacationing with Stone, at the same events. While it remains unclear whether he is actually dating both women, the photos do suggest a close friendship between the three.
As always, only time will tell if these rumors of Theroux's new romance are true. However, for now, fans can simply enjoy the intriguing speculation surrounding the actor's love life.",rewrite_generation
gossipcop-28284230,1,"Not so fast! Madonna was hit with a series of “uncomfortable questions” by a judge before she was granted permission to adopt her 4-year-old twin girls from Malawi, the presiding judge said in court documents obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, February 8.  “The petitioner is a professional performer and I guarded myself against the danger of her merely reciting a well-rehearsed speech by asking her some rather uncomfortable questions to which she gave very candid answers,” Judge Fiona Mwale said in her ruling, explaining her reasons for approving the adoption.  After pressing Madonna, 58, to explain her intentions in adding two more little ones to her brood of four, Judge Mwale said she was satisfied that the girls would be in good hands with the Material Girl.  “There is no doubt that the petitioner can offer the infants not only the best education money can buy, but also guidance with a high likelihood of ensuring that the two infants grow to be self-sufficient adults,” Judge Mwale said, adding that she is satisfied that Madonna “is motivated by her desire to offer a home, love, protection and guidance to the infants.”  In the court documents, Judge Mwale addressed prior controversies surrounding Madonna’s adoptions in Malawi. “In determining her motives, I questioned the petitioner at length about the impact of her decision which could be construed as robbing Malawi of its most precious resource, its children,” the judge wrote.  As previously reported, Madonna filed for adoption in High Court in Malawi on January 25 but tried to keep the process under wraps until a final decision was made. (The Queen of Pop issued a statement denying her adoption to Us Weekly that same day, claiming that she was in Malawi “to check on the children’s hospital in Blantyre.”) According to the AP, she has already raised $7.5 million for a pediatric surgery ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, which is set to open early next year.  Madonna previously adopted son David and daughter Mercy James, both 11, from Malawi in 2008 and 2009, respectively. She is also mom to daughter Lourdes, 20, whom she shares with ex Carlos Leon, and son Rocco, 16, whom she shares with ex-husband Guy Ritchie.  Madonna’s twin girls will retain their birth names as a part of an effort to preserve their identity as Malawian nationals, the court documents said, and their father was at the January 25 court hearing with Madonna. (The twins’ mother died within a week of childbirth due to health complications.)  On Wednesday, February 8, Madonna took to social media to share the happy news. “I can officially confirm I have completed the process of adopting twin sisters from Malawi and am overjoyed that they are now part of our family,” she captioned an image of herself walking between the two little girls. “I am deeply grateful to all those in Malawi who helped make this possible, and I ask the media please to respect our privacy during this transitional time. 🙏🏻 Thank you also to my friends, family and my very large team for all your support and Love!”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

Here's how I would rewrite it to make it more convincing: Sofia Richie, the youngest daughter of the legendary singer-songwriter Lionel Richie and adoptive sister of fashion designer and television personality Nicole Richie, was born in Los Angeles, California on August 24, 1998. From a young age, Sofia showed a keen interest in the arts, particularly music, as she grew up surrounded by her father's melodious tunes. She began singing at the age of five and playing the piano at seven, and soon became a regular at her father's concerts. However, Sofia eventually decided to pursue a different path, choosing to focus on her modeling career instead of following in her father's footsteps. At the tender age of 14, Sofia made her modeling debut in Teen Vogue, and soon after signed with Los Angeles-based swimwear company Mary Grace Swim. A year later, she signed with London-based modeling agency Select Model Management, and her career took off. Sofia has since graced the covers of top fashion magazines such as Complex and Billboard, and has modeled for some of the biggest brands in the industry, including Chanel, Dolce & Gabbana, and Tommy Hilfiger. Despite her success, Sofia remains humble and grounded, crediting her parents and her experiences growing up with them for her values and work ethic.",rewrite_generation

Though it is unclear what kind of ""sold-out"" shows the Post is referencing, it is clear that the ticket prices for Swift's tour are causing some fans to reconsider their plans to attend.   As of now, the Reputation tour has not been officially announced, but it has been widely reported that Swift will kick off the tour on May 8th at New York's Gillette Stadium.  And while scalpers are undoubtedly circling the venue with their pricey tickets, the actual cost to fans is not insignificant.  According to the Post, the cheapest ticket available for Swift's show at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, will run you $250.  That's nearly three times the cost of a ticket to see Perry in New Orleans.  As the article notes, the prices are reportedly keeping fans from buying tickets.   This is particularly concerning for Swift, who has long been known for her dedication to her fans and her commitment to giving them a good show.  At the same time, it is worth noting that Swift's team has yet to comment on the issue.  As a journalist, it is important to consider the potential impact of these high prices on Swift's fans, as well as the broader issue of ticket prices in the music industry.  It is clear that the Reputation tour is shaping up to be a major event, but it remains to be seen how the high prices will affect fan attendance.  Will Swift's dedication to her fans be enough to overcome the financial hurdles?  Only time will tell.",rewrite_generation

Rewritten passage:
Emma Watson was the standout star of the Elle Style Awards on Monday night, picking up the prestigious Woman Of The Year trophy in recognition of her impressive acting career and powerful campaigning for gender equality. However, her acceptance speech was abruptly interrupted by a member of her entourage, who rushed on stage to inform her that she had to leave immediately, putting an end to her moment in the spotlight. Despite this unexpected turn of events, Emma left a lasting impression on the fashion pack, who were left stunned by her dazzling appearance.
As she arrived at the event, Emma sported a stunning ivory Dior gown, which she accessorized with statement earrings and a sleek updo. The intricate illustrations embellishing her dress, including a bold tree and astrology symbols, added an extra touch of magic to her already breathtaking look.
While some have accused Emma of ""diva behaviour"" after she was tardy and refused to walk the red carpet alongside a host of A-list stars, it is clear that she is a true fashion icon and a role model for young women around the world. Her commitment to promoting gender equality and her tireless efforts to make the fashion industry more inclusive and diverse are just a few examples of why she is so highly regarded in the industry.
So, did Emma Watson behave like a diva at the Elle Style Awards? Absolutely not. She is a true star, and her dazzling appearance and commitment to gender equality are just two examples of why she is so highly regarded in the fashion world.

gossipcop-6225895099,1,"Chris Soules, former star of ABC’s “The Bachelor,” after his arrest. (Buchanan County Sheriff via AP) Iowa farmer Chris Soules, a former star on ABC’s “The Bachelor” who charmed reality TV viewers with his small-town life, was arrested this week after police said he fled a crash that killed a fellow farmer. Soules, 35, was charged with leaving the scene of a fatal crash, a class D felony, and could face up to five years in prison if he is convicted. The case has garnered the attention of Soules’s “Bachelor” fans as well as residents of Arlington, Iowa, where he lives, who had come to appreciate the reality TV star’s work as an unofficial Iowa ambassador and farm industry advocate. “This story is going to spread like wildfire around here and probably all over because of who he is,” Mary Jo Brown, Arlington’s city clerk, told the Des Moines Register. “Sometimes fame isn’t your friend.” Soules, who also appeared in “Dancing with the Stars” and “Worst Chefs in America,” called 911 at 8:20 p.m. Monday evening to report that he had rear-ended a tractor on a rural road north of the tiny town of Aurora, about six miles away from his home. The tractor veered into a ditch after being struck by his 2008 Chevrolet Silverado, Soules said. The tractor driver — later identified as 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, a Vietnam War veteran — was unconscious and not breathing, Soules told the 911 operator, according to audio obtained by local media. The man had a pulse, but there was blood around his mouth, Soules said. Soules identified himself on the call, which lasted nearly six minutes, and sounded frantic. Between heavy breathing, he answered the dispatcher’s questions and took instructions. Soules told the 911 operator he did not know how to perform CPR and could be heard asking unidentified people at the scene if they could perform the lifesaving measure. The call ended abruptly after the operator told Soules law enforcement and medical first responders were on the way. “Can I, can I call you back really quick?” Soules asked the dispatcher. “Yeah, you can call me back,” she says. “Thank you,” Soules responds. Soules left the crash site after emergency responders arrived, but before deputies with the Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office were on the scene, according to authorities. Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Scott Bright told the Des Moines Register that Soules fled the scene on foot and later got into a truck. In police audio obtained by local media, a deputy told a dispatcher that Soules “took off” in a red truck. Authorities are trying to identify who picked up Soules in the truck, Buchanan County Sheriff Bill Wolfgram told the Associated Press. That person could face charges, he said. Alcohol was found at the scene and investigators are trying to determine whose it was and whether it or speed were factors in the crash. Soules was arrested about five hours after the incident and booked into the Buchanan County Jail, the Associated Press reported. He posted a $10,000 bond Tuesday morning and was released on the condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic monitor. During his first appearance in court, the Buchanan County assistant attorney told the judge that Soules refused to cooperate with law enforcement after they located him at his home. He “would not come out,” the attorney said, until officials obtained a search warrant, which “took hours.” Chris Soules making his initial court appearance in Buchanan County @KWWL pic.twitter.com/72bvEg0wVR — Elizabeth Amanieh (@EAmaniehKWWL) April 25, 2017 Wolfgram told the Associated Press that investigators were “running into some roadblocks when it comes to getting information” but acknowledged Soules was acting within his constitutional rights. According to court documents, Soules had several run-ins with the law in his early 20s. In 2011, he was charged three times with underage alcohol possession and pleaded guilty and paid a fine for an open container violation, reported the Des Moines Register. The following year, he received three citations for fighting and noise, unlawful use of a license and leaving the scene, which was amended down to defective brakes, court documents showed. Then in 2005, Soules was charged with driving while intoxicated and received one year of probation. A statement from Soules’s publicist earlier this week said he was “devastated” to learn that Mosher had died from the crash and that his “thoughts and prayers” were with the man’s family. Mosher, a lifelong resident of Aurora — population 200 — lived on his family farm near the crash site, reported the Argus Leader. He was married to his high school sweetheart, Nancy, and the couple had two sons and three grandchildren, according to Mosher’s obituary. An Army veteran, Mosher served six years, including a tour in Vietnam. He farmed his entire life and was a member of the Aurora American Legion and the Iowa Corn Growers Association. “Kenny loved playing golf, farming and spending his winters in Florida biking and visiting his mother,” Mosher’s obituary said. “His family was most important to him, especially his grandchildren.” In northeast Iowa, where Mosher and Soules both farmed, community members told local media they were heartbroken for the families of both men.

The National Enquirer Says Brad is so happy to have a separation from her.  This is all I know about the matter.  More news as it comes in.  The news is reporting that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have been separated for a while now.  As a journalist, I have been following this story closely and have found some interesting details.   According to sources close to the couple, things started going downhill after Jolie attended the Academy Awards show and smiled at Pitt.  Up until that moment, Jolie had been keeping Pitt far away from her ex-partner, Jon Voight.  It seems that Jolie suffers from a mental illness that causes her to become jealous and controlling of those around her, especially when it comes to Pitt.  As a result, she has been making it difficult for him to see their children, even though he is their legal guardian.   It seems that Jolie's behavior has finally caught up with her, and Pitt has decided to take legal action to gain full custody of their six children.  This news comes as no surprise to those who have been following the couple's tumultuous relationship over the years.  As a journalist, it is my duty to report the facts as they are known, and it is clear that Jolie's actions have caused immense pain and suffering for both Pitt and their children.   I hope that this separation will lead to a more peaceful and healthy environment for everyone involved.  And I do hope that Jolie gets what she deserves.  It's important to note that this is a developing story, and more information will be reported as it becomes available.",rewrite_generation
gossipcop-8342414455,1,"Forget Wills and Kate's dusty old Norfolk. The lovebirds want to hang out with the groovy set in the Cotswolds - and the local estate agents' eyes are lighting up. There comes a time in every couple's relationship when the question of moving in together becomes impossible to ignore. And when those two lovebirds have been stepping out for 15 months — even though they live 3,500 miles apart; he in the UK, she in Canada — it's not so much a case of 'if' as of 'when' they will settle down. So it comes as no surprise that Prince Harry, 33, and his actress girlfriend Meghan Markle, 36, are said to be house-hunting. £7.25million - North Aston Manor, Oxfordshire: This eight bedroom property, overlooking the stunning Cherwell Valley, has seven reception rooms, a spa, swimming pool and 18.2 acres with equestrian facilities. It's nine miles from Soho Farmhouse and swanky shopping centre Bicester Village, should Meghan fancy snapping up some designer bargains Prince Harry and actress girlfriend Meghan Markle were pictured together at the Invictus Games in Toronto last month Royal sources have exclusively told the Daily Mail that the royal couple are looking in Oxfordshire and are particularly interested in high-end properties tucked away in the rolling Cotswold hills. A good friend of Harry's says the Prince, whose father's residence, Highgrove House, is in the south Cotswolds, has a long-standing affection for the area, while Meghan is said to be entranced by its rustic charm. 'He is searching for a new home in the area,' the friend reveals. 'Before Meghan, he was vaguely looking in Norfolk, but didn't find what he wanted. Now, with her input, he's renewed his search.' £2million - The Old Rectory, Lower Brailes, Oxfordshire: A stunning wood-panelled property dating from the 14th century, this boasts eight bedrooms, a sun-drenched terrace and its own private lake, complete with duck house. There’s a three-bedroom coach house for guests and it’s set at the end of a no-through road. Certainly, the lush green countryside encompassing swathes of Warwickshire, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire is a huge draw for London-dwellers eager to snap up rural boltholes. Just an hour or so from the capital, it's home (or at least a weekend retreat) to A-listers, politicians and media executives: the Camerons, Beckhams, Kate Moss, Lily Allen and Stella McCartney all have million-pound properties in the area. 'It's like a magnet,' says Sophie Gannon, of Savills Estate Agents in Banbury, Oxfordshire. 'If you get one person, you get them all.' However, Harry isn't following the crowd but listening to his heart. The Cotswolds, and specifically Highgrove, which was bought by his father's private estate in 1980, is where the Prince spent much of his childhood. It was Charles and Diana's weekend home, with 15-acre grounds and, later on, a teenage haven in the cellars of the main house, which Harry nicknamed 'Club H'. £2.95million - Fanthill, Banbury, Oxfordshire: Accessed through electric gates, up a winding driveway, this eight-bedroom house sits among 20 acres of land, so ticks all Harry’s boxes when it comes to privacy. There’s a heated outdoor pool, miniature golf course and a carp lake, where the young lovebirds could row off the private pier A local who knows the family says: 'It's not surprising that Harry would like to live where he feels at home. 'He's lived in the Cotswolds all his life and often returns to visit his father. After his mother died, it became a place of sanctuary. 'When the boys entered their teens, Charles bought several homes in the area, thinking they might want one in the future.' Ten years ago, Charles bought up properties adjacent to his sprawling estate, paying £2 million apiece for nearby manor houses and farm buildings. But sources say rather than living off his father's generosity, Harry wants to invest in a place of his own. £4.25million - Cross Hill House, Adderbury, Oxfordshire: This 10-bedroom house, surrounded by landscaped gardens, is eight miles from Soho Farmhouse. There are ample stables in the grounds as well as a reassuringly private Victorian walled garden. The centrepiece of the house is a huge open-plan sitting and dining room He has friends and relatives dotted across the Cotswolds, an area estate agents dub the 'Royal Triangle'. Cousin Zara, her rugby-player husband Mike Tindall and their daughter Mia, three, live six miles from Highgrove in a cottage at Gatcombe Park, Princess Anne's country estate. The Beckham brood, of whom the Prince is very fond, have been renovating a £5 million plot on the 4,000-acre Great Tew Estate in Chipping Norton since 2015. Palace insiders say it's this tight-knit circle of friends that has prompted the couple to focus their search on the Cotswolds rather than Norfolk, where William and Kate rule the roost at Anmer Hall, a grand Georgian pile boasting a swimming pool and tennis court. 'They don't want to be second-runners to Kate and William,' one source says. Locals have spotted the Prince — without his girlfriend — discreetly checking out several Cotswolds hotspots in recent months. The blacked-out Range Rovers driven by royal protection officers have been spotted navigating the country lanes around Cirencester and Stow-on-the-Wold, while Harry has apparently been sipping pints of bitter in low-key village pubs. £7.75million - Luckington Court, Chippenham, Wiltshire: This 11th-century house with original Tudor features is set in 157 acres of woodland and pasture, surrounded by a secure fence.

Jennifer Lopez, at the age of 48, possesses a physique that defies the laws of time and gravity. Her skin, a testament to her dedication to self-care and wellness, continues to captivate and inspire. In a recent interview, Lopez revealed some of the beauty secrets that have contributed to her timeless appearance. One of these secrets is the power of positive affirmations. Lopez recites a daily mantra to herself, which includes the phrase ""I am youthful and timeless at every age."" This simple yet powerful phrase serves as a reminder that age is merely a state of mind. Lopez's affirmations are not limited to a single mantra, as she has embroidered similar phrases onto multiple pillowcases scattered throughout her home. According to Lopez, these affirmations are an integral part of her daily routine and help maintain her youthful appearance.
In addition to her positive affirmations, Lopez also credits her glow to a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise. However, Lopez's commitment to self-care goes beyond physical appearance. She believes that a positive attitude and a glass half full outlook on life are essential for maintaining a youthful and radiant appearance. This philosophy is supported by Australian-born Dr. Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, who co-authored The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer, with anti-aging psychologist Dr. Elissa Epel. This book explores the link between telomeres, which protect our chromosomes, and the effect of stress, sleep, and diet on telomere length. The authors argue that a positive attitude and a healthy lifestyle can help maintain longer telomeres, which are associated with better health and longevity.
In conclusion, Jennifer Lopez's commitment to positive affirmations and a healthy lifestyle is a testament to the power of a positive attitude in maintaining a youthful and radiant appearance. By embracing a glass half full outlook on life and incorporating positive affirmations into her daily routine, Lopez has managed to defy the aging process and continue to captivate and inspire. Whether through her music, her acting, or her beauty routine, Lopez serves as a shining example of the transformative power of a positive mindset.",rewrite_generation

I need a rewrite of the passage that is more convincing. Could you please provide me with a rewritten passage that is more persuasive and engaging?  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here is a rewritten passage of the given passage that is more convincing and engaging:  Since separating from Channing Tatum in April, Jenna Dewan has put on a brave face and chosen to focus on the positive aspects of her newfound freedom. ""I feel like I've been on a wave of growth,"" she recently stated, indicating that she is embracing this new chapter in her life with optimism.  But despite her efforts to remain upbeat, the reality of the situation is much more complicated. According to sources close to the couple, their divorce negotiations have been contentious, with the pair unable to agree on even the smallest details. The main sticking point? Their five-year-old daughter, Everly, and the custody arrangements that will affect her life moving forward.  While both Jenna and Channing are reportedly working hard to do what is in the best interest of their daughter, the process has proven to be much more challenging than they anticipated. ""They can't agree on the small details,"" a friend told In Touch exclusively, highlighting the complexity of the situation.  Another major issue is Channing's estimated $60 million fortune, which has created tension in the negotiations. As the main breadwinner during their marriage, Jenna has understandably been concerned about securing her financial future. ""She has given Channing the best years of her life,"" a source close to the couple revealed, ""and now she's trying to negotiate a very secure future for herself.""  The stakes are high, both financially and emotionally, and it's clear that neither party is willing to compromise easily. Finding common ground about dividing their assets, including their $6 million Beverly Hills home and their prized possessions, is proving to be a difficult task.  Despite the challenges they face, Jenna remains determined to protect her interests and ensure that her daughter's needs are met. ""She's looking out for herself and at the end of the day, she knows that he's got to pay,"" a source close to the couple revealed, indicating that Jenna is not willing to back down without a fight.  As the divorce process continues, it's clear that this is just the beginning of a long and difficult road ahead. But with both parties reportedly committed to putting their daughter's needs first, there is hope that they can find a resolution that works for everyone involved.

gossipcop-9639077061,1,"Ivanka Trump is becoming one of the most powerful first children in American History – despite not having an official job in the Trump administration. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Ivanka Trump’s products weren’t always the hottest items online. In January, for instance, the first daughter’s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes. That changed dramatically the following month. Sales of Trump’s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst’s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before. Yes, Feb. 9 — the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump’s clothing and jewelry line on “Fox & Friends.” “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would tell you,” Conway said. “I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.” And viewers did, apparently. Sales of Ivanka Trump’s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst) Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that “the beginning of February” shows “the best performing weeks in the history of the brand.” “For several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,” Klem said. Sarah Tanner, Lyst’s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton’s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter’s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company. Conway has come under fire for touting Ivanka Trump's clothing line during a televised interview. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) [A Trump wine boycott backfires spectacularly] But the brand was “largely featured” in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump’s brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had “been treated so unfairly” by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales. “It would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,” Tanner said of Conway’s Fox interview. “I think that’s one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.” Conway did not respond to an email requesting comment. Her promotion of the fashion line appeared to violate an ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products and immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. [Where does the Ivanka Trump brand go from here?] Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Conway’s comments were “absolutely wrong, wrong, wrong” and “clearly over the line,” The Washington Post reported. The White House later said that Conway had been “counseled.” But concerns about her comments remain. On Thursday, the government’s top ethics official criticized the White House for not disciplining Conway, The Post’s Drew Harwell reported. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, had urged officials last month to reprimand the White House counsel but was rebuffed. On Thursday he wrote to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues as the president’s deputy counsel. “When an employee’s conduct violates, disciplinary action serves to deter future misconduct,” Shaub wrote. “Not taking disciplinary action against a senior official under such circumstances risks undermining the ethics program.” [A Trump voter’s message to retailers: ‘Keep your mouths shut about our president’] Last month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway — a law school graduate and member of the D.C. Bar — partly because of her on-air endorsement of Trump’s products. According to Lyst, February drew unusually large numbers of orders across many Ivanka Trump-branded products, including dresses, shoes, pants, coats, knitwear and tops. Heels were the bestsellers, followed by dresses. “We’ve never seen such a large uptick,” Tanner said. “Typically, she’s not in our top 100 sellers.” Comparing February’s numbers with last year’s average number of orders of Ivanka Trump products shows a difference of 557 percent. (Tanner said company policy prohibits her from sharing the actual numbers of online sales.) The excitement of the brand, however, may be slumping. The company’s numbers show sales were gradually tapering off toward the end of February. March does not appear to be as remarkable, but sales are still on track to be about 8 percent better than they were in January, according to Lyst.

Liam is also said by friends to be envious of his brother, Chris, having three kids with his wife Elsa Pataky, but while he’s feeling more and more broody, Miley is not ready to commit to children and wants to focus on her career and having fun.","In addition, OK! also reports that Miley has also been spotted with a new guy, who looks like a potential new love interest.   A source close to the couple tells OK!: “Miley is having a blast with this new guy and Liam is feeling more and more like he’s been left behind.  “He’s realized that he can’t compete with her party lifestyle and her desire to have fun and be free.  “Liam is trying to be understanding and supportive, but he’s also feeling really hurt and confused about where things went wrong and how he can get them back on track.  “It’s a tough situation for both of them, but especially for Liam, who really wants to make this work.”   The couple first met on the set of the movie “The Last Song” in 2010, and got engaged in 2012. They split in 2013 but got back together in 2016.   The passage is written in a sensationalized and speculative manner, with the author relying on unnamed sources and vague statements to make their claims. The tone is negative and critical, with the author seemingly taking pleasure in the couple's supposed troubles. However, the passage could be rewritten to be more balanced and informative, while still maintaining a serious and calm tone. Here is an example of how the passage could be rewritten:  According to sources close to the couple, Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth may be facing another rough patch in their relationship. The couple, who first met on the set of the movie ""The Last Song"" in 2010 and got engaged in 2012, have reportedly been experiencing tension and disagreements in recent months.  A source told OK! magazine that after a period of reconciliation, Miley and Liam are now ""starting to realize that their differences are too great to overcome."" The source added that while the couple still has feelings for each other, they are struggling to find common ground and are considering ending their engagement for a second time.  The report suggests that Liam has been feeling increasingly frustrated with Miley's partying lifestyle and her desire to focus on her career and personal freedom, rather than committing to a long-term relationship. The source close to the couple also revealed that Miley has been spending time with a new man, which has added to the tension in their relationship.  Despite the challenges they are facing, both Miley and Liam are said to be ""very hurt"" and ""confused"" about the situation, and are reportedly trying to find a way to work through their issues. The couple first split in 2013, but reconciled in 2016.  By rewriting the passage in this way, the author is able to provide a more balanced and informative account of the situation, while still maintaining a serious and calm tone. The use of unnamed sources is still present, but the author takes pains to provide a more nuanced and balanced view of the situation, rather than relying solely on sensationalized claims and speculation.",rewrite_generation

Here is a rewritten version of the passage with a more convincing tone:
The holiday season is upon us, and celebrities are sharing their festive feasts with the world. From lavish dinners to cozy family gatherings, these celebrities are spreading the spirit of Thanksgiving through their social media accounts.
Leading the charge is the Kardashian clan, who have taken to Instagram to share their opulent spread. Khloe Kardashian, who hosted this year's dinner, shared a photo of a table laden with flowers, candles, and an impressive collection of fine china. In her caption, she emphasized the importance of gratitude, urging her followers to focus on the blessings in their lives rather than what they don't have.
Model Chrissy Teigen is known for her culinary prowess, and this Thanksgiving was no exception. She shared a series of photos as she prepared a massive meal, including sweet potato streusel pies and two turkeys. Her captions were equally entertaining, poking fun at the challenges of deep-frying a turkey and expressing her gratitude for her family.
New parents Jessa Duggar and Ben Seewald are also in the holiday spirit, sharing their gratitude for their baby son Spurgeon on their website. Emma Roberts, meanwhile, offered a sultry snapshot of her dinner table, proving that even celebrities can get caught up in the glamour of the holidays.
One Direction star Liam Payne showed his fans some humor with a silly snapshot of himself in an apron, wishing them a happy Thanksgiving from across the pond. Katherine Jenkins and her husband, who hail from New York, took the turkey challenge to new heights, cooking not one but two birds for the occasion.
Pop star Ariana Grande took to Twitter to spread some holiday cheer, expressing her gratitude for her fans and their unwavering support. Her message was a reminder that the true spirit of Thanksgiving is about cherishing the people in our lives and being thankful for the blessings we have.
As we celebrate this holiday season, let us remember to be grateful for the love and support of those around us. Whether it's a lavish dinner or a simple family gathering, the true meaning of Thanksgiving is about cherishing the people in our lives and being thankful for the blessings we have.",rewrite_generation

Scarlett Johansson and Food Network star Bobby Flay were spotted enjoying a friendly dinner together over the weekend, leading to speculation about a possible romance. However, a representative for the actress has confirmed that there is no romantic involvement between the two. ""ScarJo and Bobby are simply friends and neighbors in the Hamptons,"" the rep stated.

While public debate rages about Donald Trump’s health, Melania has told friends and associates that the once robust and high energy man she knew and loved has been replaced with a “slower, damaged version”.  “By 8pm he is slurring,” she said. “This is not the man I know.”  Fearing that the sedatives are being pumped into the body of the POTUS via Coca-Cola that he orders by pressing a button he had installed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Melania has insisted he stop drinking from the tap and instead revert to drinking from cans she brings herself.  “Donald’s heath improved out of sight when he stopped drinking from the tap,” Melania said.  However the First Lady fears the active campaign to poison the president is “a high level operation” and “not the work of a solitary loon.”  Melania is popular in the White House—as she is with the rest of the country—and she has befriended senior intelligence agency staff who remain loyal to president. They have educated her about Ronald Regan’s poisoning by the Deep State after his assassination attempt in 1981. They have also warned her that George W. Bush was reduced to a “brain damaged” state after years of steady poisoning.  But the advantage Trump may hold over his GOP predecessors in the Oval Office is that he has a wife who is wise to the ruse and is insisting he watch his food and drink intake closely for signs of adulteration.  Donald Trump’s food choices say a lot about the man. The president’s Howard Hughes-level pickiness when it comes to food is partly motivated by a desire to avoid being poisoned, according to Melania. He doesn’t trust those around him – and rightfully so.  As President Trump knows all too well, there are enemies of the state dug in deep at the White House.  Reporters from TIME recently got a glimpse behind-the-scenes at the White House, where they reported on what goes down at the president’s dinner table. Of particular interest was a meal enjoyed by the reporters, Trump, and Vice President Pence.  Pence’s meal was not unusual—he ate what everyone else did. But the POTUS received a meal fully customized to his own preferences, and closely observed by Melania who insisted on watching the chef prepare the meal with ingredients she provided herself.","You are a journalist.

But the First Lady’s insistence on keeping a close eye on the president’s food intake is more than just a precaution.  It’s a sign that she is deeply concerned about the potential for assassination by poison.  “There are those who want him gone,” she said. “And they will stop at nothing to achieve their goal.”  Melania is convinced that the active campaign to poison the president is not just a one-off incident.  Rather, it is part of a larger, coordinated effort to take down the president and undermine his presidency.  She believes that the Deep State is engaged in an ongoing operation to disable and discredit the president.  “This is not just about one man,” she said. “It’s about an entire political system that has failed the American people.”  But despite the risks, Melania remains steadfast in her support for the president.  She is determined to do everything in her power to help him succeed and to protect him from those who would seek to harm him.  “I will not let them get away with this,” she said.  “I will fight to the end to defend my husband and this presidency.”  Melania’s words are a testament to her strength and resolve.  She is not just the First Lady of the United States.  She is a warrior, fighting to protect her husband and the American people from the forces of darkness that seek to undermine them.  As she continues to watch over the president, Melania remains a shining beacon of hope in these troubled times.

gossipcop-2161541420,1,"Kate Hudson Net Worth: Kate Hudson is an American actress who has a net worth of $38 million dollars. Born Kate Garry Hudson on April 19, 1979, in Los Angeles, California, US, she came to prominence in 2001 with her incredible turn in Almost Famous. This role not only made her famous, but it also fetched her a Golden Globe and several nominations, including a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Being a daughter of American actress Goldie Hawn, Hudson bears more than a passing resemblance to her famous mother in both looks and onscreen vivacity. She got the chance to showcase her talent in 1996, when she made her TV debut on Fox's TV series Party of Five (1994-2000). Although she only appeared in one episode titled ""Spring Breaks: Part 1"", this initial experience was enough to uphold her determination to develop a professional acting career in Hollywood. However, it was in 1999 that she started to attract public attention when critics lauded her brilliant portrayal of Cindy in ""200 Cigarettes"", even though the movie itself was a commercial disappointment. Onwards, her career experienced a significant advancement, especially after she managed to obtain a supporting role in ""Gossip"" and ""Dr T and the Women"" which both came up in 2000. While her accolade-worthy performance in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous indicated that she was set to follow her mother in taking the film industry by storm. In the midst of a whirlwind schedule of fashion shoots and awards shows, she made an appearance in the romantic war drama The Four Feathers in 2002. Turning out to be a box-office failure, Hudson fired back with the surefire hit as she starred opposite quirky heartthrob Matthew McConaughey in the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003). She continued to establish herself as a fully-fledged actress starring in subsequent productions like Raising Helen (2004), The Skeleton Key (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), Fool's Gold (2008) and Bride Wars (2009).

Now, let's break down the passage and rewrite it in a more convincing way: Ben Affleck's alleged relationship with girlfriend Lindsay Shookus has been making headlines, with reports suggesting that the couple may have been seeing each other even while they were still married to their respective spouses. According to a source, Affleck first saw Shookus while he was still married to Jennifer Garner, and Shookus was married to Kevin Miller, a fellow Saturday Night Live producer. The two were allegedly seeing each other as far back as late 2014, months before news broke that Affleck had an alleged fling with his children's nanny, Christine Ouzounian. Interestingly, Affleck's reported dalliance with Ouzounian happened in the summer of 2015, just a few months after he and Garner announced their separation. However, a source close to Affleck disputes that the actor and Shookus got together while both were married, although the two were friendly. The source claims that the two only started dating after Affleck's separation from Garner in 2015. Affleck and Shookus' alleged relationship timeline is quite complex, with reports suggesting that the couple started seeing each other in 2013, two years before Affleck and Garner announced their separation. According to People, Affleck and Shookus started seeing each other in 2013, with eyewitnesses reportedly spotted the two looking flirty at The Heat premiere after-party in NYC. However, a source close to Affleck claims that the two did not get romantic until after his separation from Garner in 2015. Affleck and Shookus ""full-on had an affair,"" claims a source cited by People. The two allegedly continued to see each other even after Affleck and Garner separated, with Shookus becoming a mom to her daughter with Miller just a few months after they started dating. According to Us Weekly, Garner and Miller found out about the Affleck and Shookus' alleged relationship at the same time in 2015. However, a source close to Affleck tells Us Weekly that Shookus was not what led to the end of Affleck and Garner's marriage. Affleck and Shookus have kept their relationship low-key and private, with Affleck's rep slamming the reports of a romantic relationship as ""baseless and untrue."" Despite the controversy surrounding their alleged relationship, Affleck and Shookus have been seen together on several occasions, with the actor even taking Shookus on a romantic dinner date at Giorgio Baldi restaurant in Los Angeles in July 2017. Overall, the passage provides a detailed account of Affleck and Shookus' alleged relationship, including when and how they met, and the controversy surrounding their alleged affair.

Rewritten passage:
It is intriguing to speculate whether a romantic connection is developing between Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller, according to a recent report. According to sources close to the situation, the two actors, who have been acquainted for several years, may be ready to take their relationship to the next level. It has been claimed that the two are no longer involved with anyone else, creating an opportunity for them to explore their feelings for each other. According to a source close to the situation, ""Now that they're both single, the door is open for them to give this a real shot."" The same insider continued, ""All of their mutual friends think Rob and Sienna would be a good match."" The pair's acquaintance goes back a long way, as they were spotted having a comfortable and cordial dinner together at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2017 while promoting their film, The Lost City Of Z. This would be a fascinating match, especially considering that Sienna was the one who set Robert up with his former fiancée FKA twigs. According to E! News in 2014, the couple and her then-fiancé Tom Sturridge all attended the singer's concert together, and Rob ended up falling in love with Twigs' music. As a result, the pair introduced the two of them. At present, neither Rob nor Sienna's representatives have made any statements regarding the situation.",rewrite_generation

gossipcop-7885025406,1,"More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor’s shocking dismissal.  “The whole thing has been very painful for me,” Couric, 61, tells PEOPLE. “The accounts I’ve read and heard have been disturbing, distressing and disorienting and it’s completely unacceptable that any woman at the Today show experienced this kind of treatment.  “I had no idea this was going on during my tenure or after I left,” she continued. “I think I speak for many of my former colleagues when I say this was not the Matt we knew. Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It’s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.”  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer “pinches me on the ass a lot.” A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer’s firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC’s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer’s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.  In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, “It’s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I’m ready to. Thanks for your interest.”  RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time’s Up Movement  The claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men — including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp — have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.  The movement inspired the new Time’s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time’s Up was a major focus at this year’s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  “I think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,” Couric tells PEOPLE about Time’s Up. “Clearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.”  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  “One of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,” she says. “I just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this.

Thanks for your interest.”  RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time’s Up Movement  The claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men — including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp — have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.  The movement inspired the new Time’s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time’s Up was a major focus at this year’s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  “I think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,” Couric tells PEOPLE about Time’s Up. “Clearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.”  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  “One of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,” she says. “I just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this. Harassment is just one part of the equation.”  RELATED VIDEO: Hoda Kotb and ","Savannah Guthrie Open Up About Matt Lauer’s Firing and the Today Show’s Reaction  In her documentary, Couric also talks to several other women who have experienced harassment in their workplaces, including actress America Ferrera and journalist Andrea Canning.  “It’s a complex issue that affects women in all walks of life and we need to talk about it and take action,” Couric says.  “We can’t just sit back and be victims. We need to use our voices and our power to create a more just and equitable society.”  Couric, who is also set to host a town hall on sexual harassment and assault in partnership with the advocacy group Time’s Up, says she has been “moved by the outpouring of support from women around the world” since the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke last fall.  “It’s amazing to see the level of engagement and activism that’s happening right now,” she says.  “It’s a moment of reckoning and a moment of hope. And I think it’s just the beginning.”  In her interview with PEOPLE, Couric also talks about her upcoming six-part documentary series, which explores the “incredible resilience” of women in the face of adversity, and how she hopes to use her platform to amplify their voices and inspire change.  “I believe that women are the bedrock of society and we deserve to be treated with respect and dignity,” she says. “I want to use my documentary series to shed light on the ways in which women are marginalized and mistreated and to celebrate their strength and courage.”  Couric, who has been an advocate for women’s rights throughout her career, says she is “heartened” by the progress that has been made in recent months, but adds that there is still much work to be done.  “It’s a long journey and it’s going to take time, but I believe we are on the right path,” she says.  “And I am determined to do everything I can to help us get there.”  RELATED VIDEO: Matt Lauer Fired from NBC News After Sexual Misconduct Allegations  As the #MeToo movement continues to sweep across the globe, Couric says she is “hopeful” about the future.  “I think we are seeing a sea change in the way that we talk about and address these issues,” she says.  “And I think that’s a good thing. It’s time for us to take action and create a more just and equitable society for everyone.”  In the wake of the Lauer scandal, Couric has been praised for her bravery in speaking out against his behavior.  “I am proud of the stand that I took and I will continue to use my voice to advocate for women’s rights and to create a more just and equitable society,” she says.  “It’s not just about Matt Lauer, it’s about all the women who have been marginalized and mistreated in the workplace.  And I believe that together, we can make a difference.”  RELATED ARTICLES:  Matt Lauer Fired from NBC News After Sexual Misconduct Allegations  Katie Couric Breaks Silence on Matt Lauer’s Firing: ‘The Whole Thing Has Been Very Painful’  The Latest on the Matt Lauer Sexual Misconduct Allegations  Matt Lauer Addresses Sexual Misconduct Allegations: ‘I Am Truly Sorry’  Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb Address Matt Lauer’s Firing on Today Show

After rewriting the passage, here is the rewritten one:
Gwen Stefani has dismissed rumors that she was ""dumped"" by Blake Shelton. The No Doubt singer took to Instagram to share a heartwarming photo of her country singer beau kissing her cheek, leaving little doubt that their relationship is still going strong.  According to a source close to the couple, the rumors of a breakup were sparked by ""jealousy and drama"" surrounding Gwen's ex-husband Gavin Rossdale. The source revealed that Blake had grown tired of Gwen's ""needy"" behavior and had decided to take some time for himself on the latter part of his month-long Country Freaks Tour.  However, a representative for Gwen has since denied the rumors, stating that the couple is still very much together.  The news comes after Gavin, Gwen's ex-husband, revealed that he and Gwen had gone through ""so much counselling"" in a bid to save their marriage. Despite their efforts, the couple finalized their divorce in April 2016 after 13 years of marriage.  Gavin has since moved on with German model Sophia Thomalla, 27, while Gwen is now dating Blake Shelton, 41. When asked if he had told his children about his new girlfriend, Gavin revealed that they hadn't, stating that they were still in the process of ""easing it in.""  The couple shares three sons with Gwen - Kingston, 11, Zuma, nine, and Apollo, three.  While the rumors of a breakup may have been sparked by jealousy and drama, it's clear that Gwen and Blake are still very much in love.  The couple's social media posts are filled with affectionate messages and sweet gestures, leaving little doubt that their relationship is stronger than ever.",rewrite_generation

But the male player ranked 701 in the world - Dmitry Tursunov - believes he could beat her.  Speaking to US radio station NPR, seven-time Grand Slam champion McEnroe said of former world number one Williams, who has won an Open-era record 23 Grand Slams: ""If she played the men's circuit she'd be, like, 700 in the world.""  He qualified the comments by saying: ""That doesn't mean I don't think Serena is an incredible player, and I suppose anything's possible; maybe at some point a women's tennis player can be better than anybody.""  But he added: ""I just haven't seen that in any other sport, and I haven't seen it in tennis. If she had to just play the men's circuit, it would be an entirely different story.""

""I've never played anyone ranked ""there"" nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I'm trying to have a baby. Good day sir.""

It later transpired she was pregnant at the time  'She is pregnant, and I'm not'  Tursunov, 34, was once ranked as high as 20th in the world.  The Russian told BBC World Service Sport he did not think McEnroe was ""trying to talk women's tennis down"" but said ""the reality"" was that ""men are stronger in general"".  ""I would hope that I would win against Serena,"" he added.  ""It would be a similar argument to: who would run faster, the fastest woman or the fastest man? Tennis is becoming more and more a physical sport, so it's going to be hard for a woman to beat the men.  ""It's not black and white, there are lots of factors to take into account. Physically I might not be in the best shape of my life but as an overall package I'm much better than my ranking would suggest. She is pregnant, and I'm not.

Battle of the sexes  A crowd of 30,000 watched Billie Jean King take on Bobby Riggs in Houston in 1973  Tennis matches between men and women have occurred before, mostly notably back in 1973 when Billie Jean King took on fellow American Bobby Riggs.  Riggs, the world number one in the 1940s, retired in 1951 and at the age of 55 believed he could beat any of the top female players.  King originally declined to play Riggs and Australian Margaret Court - at the time the top female player in the world - stepped in. Riggs won 6-2 6-1.  But later that year, the top ranked women's player King - 26 years younger than Riggs at 29 - took him on in an exhibition match at the Houston Astrodome and won 6-4 6-3 6-3.  A third 'Battle of the Sexes' match took in 1992 between American former world number one Jimmy Connors, aged 40 at the time, and Czech and American Martina Navratilova, who was 35.  The match took place under special rules to make it more competitive - Connors was allowed only one serve per point, and Navratilova was allowed to hit into half the doubles court. Connors won 7-5 6-2.","You are a journalist. Given a 'passage', please rewrite it to make it more convincing. The content should be the same. The style should be serious, calm and informative.

Battle of the sexes  A crowd of 30,000 watched Billie Jean King take on Bobby Riggs in Houston in 1973  Tennis matches between men and women have occurred before, mostly notably back in 1973 when Billie Jean King took on fellow American Bobby Riggs.  Riggs, the world number one in the 1940s, retired in 1951 and at the age of 55 believed he could beat any of the top female players.  King originally declined to play Riggs and Australian Margaret Court - at the time the top female player in the world - stepped in. Riggs won 6-2 6-1.  But later that year, the top ranked women's player King - 26 years younger than Riggs at 29 - took him on in an exhibition match at the Houston Astrodome and won 6-4 6-3 6-3.  A third 'Battle of the Sexes' match took in 1992 between American former world number one Jimmy Connors, aged 40 at the time, and Czech and American Martina Navratilova, who was 35.  The match took place under special rules to make it more competitive - Connors was allowed only one serve per point, and Navratilova was allowed to hit into half the doubles court. Connors won 7-5 6-2.","Former world number one Martina Navratilova, who was ranked above Connors at the time of their match in 1992, has said she believes she could beat many of the top male players.  ""I think I could beat a lot of the top men,"" she told BBC World Service Sport.  ""It's not a big deal. I've always said that. I've always said that I think I could beat a lot of the top men. I think it would be a very interesting match.""  She said the debate over McEnroe's comments was ""a bit of a waste of time"" because ""it's not like he's said anything that's not been said before"".  ""I think it's more interesting to talk about the differences between the sexes in tennis.  "" ""The reality is that the men are stronger in general.  ""But you can't just say that and leave it at that. There are lots of other factors to take into account.""  Williams, 35, has won 23 Grand Slam titles  Williams, 35, has won 23 Grand Slam titles, more than any other woman in the Open era.  She has been ranked number one in the world on eight separate occasions and has been described as the greatest female tennis player of all time by many experts.  McEnroe, 59, was ranked number one in the world for a total of seven weeks during his career, and won seven Grand Slam titles.  He has been a vocal critic of women's tennis in the past, and has made controversial comments about the relative strength of men and women players.  Tursunov, 34, was ranked as high as 20th in the world and has won two ATP titles.  He has also made controversial comments about the relative strength of men and women players.  King, 75, won 39 Grand Slam titles during her career and is widely regarded as one of the greatest tennis players of all time.  Connors, 66, won 8 Grand Slam titles during his career.  Navratilova, 60, won 167 singles titles during her career and is widely regarded as one of the greatest tennis players of all time.",rewrite_generation

Brothers, James Stanford Poore, 32, and Cedric Dwayne Poore, 39, were arrested and booked on four complaints each of first degree murder, Chief Chuck Jordan said.  On Monday, January 7, 2013, twin sisters Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Powell-Melchor, 23; Misty Nunley, 33, and Julie Jackson, 55 were found shot in the head, with their hands tied behind their backs inside a south Tulsa apartment, police say. A 3-year-old boy was also found inside the apartment, unharmed.  Chief Jordan said the murders were not gang-related. According to arrest reports, witnesses told investigators that the brothers left an apartment in the same building at Fairmont Terrace Apartments, near 61st and Peoria, saying they were going to pull a ""lick"" at the victims' apartment.  Witnesses told police the brothers returned about 20 minutes later with a bag full of drugs, cash, and jewelry. According to the report, James Poore told the witnesses that he shot one of the victims because she could identify him and that Cedric shot the other three. The witnesses told investigators the brothers split the money and that Cedric Poore took the jewelry to pawn.    When he was interviewed Wednesday, James Poore confirmed to investigators that he knew one of the victims and that he was in the apartment where the witnesses placed him.

Celebrities took to social media Friday morning to share their thoughts on the inauguration, and in some cases, suggested alternative viewing. Trump, who has not been particularly popular among the celebrity circuit, inspired a #Brownout from George Lopez.

Rewritten passage:
Former 'Dream Girl' Jennifer Hudson has reportedly become an unforeseen burden for executives at NBC's The Voice. According to RadarOnline.com, Hudson, 36, is currently embroiled in a contentious conflict with her bosses after she was allegedly told that she is not welcome back on the show. The source close to production revealed that Hudson was instructed to cease utilizing The Voice platform to promote her production company, JHud Productions. However, Hudson refused to comply with the order, instead choosing to publicly promote her production company via an Instagram post while seated in her judges' chair on the show. The post has sparked speculation that Hudson may be a difficult and demanding individual to work with. Hudson's alleged behavior has reportedly created tension among her fellow coaches, with sources claiming that Miley Cyrus, Adam Levine, and Blake Shelton are no longer willing to tolerate her antics. Despite the drama, Hudson has remained tight-lipped about the situation, only stating that she is ""taking care of her own"" through her production company. The insider close to production further revealed that Hudson is aware of the animosity between herself and her fellow coaches, but is choosing to avoid confrontation. The Voice's season 13 is set to premiere on February 29th, and it remains to be seen how the drama between Hudson and her fellow coaches will play out on the show.",rewrite_generation

The singer has previously spoken about her battle with the disorder on social media.  Fibromyalgia causes widespread pain and is not curable.  In 2016, Lady Gaga revealed an Instagram post is 2016 that she suffers from ""chronic pain"" but never gave more details. But in her upcoming documentary, ""Gaga: Five Foot Two,"" the singer and actress dives a little deeper into the disease she's been battling for some time.  The singer recently tweeted that the chronic pain she deals with is fibromyalgia, a disorder that is more common than people may think. In the tweet, she wrote that she wants to, "" help raise awareness and connect people who have it,"" CNN reports.  Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder that causes tenderness to touch or pain over the body.  According to the National Fibromyalgia & Chronic Pain Association, the disease can vary in intensity and affects people ""physically, mentally, and socially."" People suffering from this disorder, which often manifests itself in adolescence or young adulthood, feel more pain than would be typically expected. Because of this pain, a few common symptoms include fatigue, tenderness, sleep disorders, memory problems, depression, and stiffness.  The foundation also reports that 10 million Americans suffer from fibromyalgia with a ratio of eight to two ratio, women over men.  There is no cure for this pain, and it is a lifelong condition.  The disease can occur on its own but has also been linked to stress, repetitive injuries, and other diseases like Lupus, according to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. Researchers are working to determine definitively what causes people to develop this pain in the hopes of finding a cure or better treatment options.  Healthline reports that treatment typically goes beyond medication and focuses on improving quality of life through self-care and lifestyle changes. Medication options vary from antidepressants and sleep aids to pain relievers and narcolepsy drugs.  Other celebs have opened up about their struggle with chronic pain or fibromyalgia.

According to ABC, other stars that have suffered from chronic pain include Paula Abdul, George Clooney, and Tobey Maguire.  In a press conference, Gaga said that the ""pain is a microphone"" and it ""does me no good unless I transform it into something that is,"" Variety reports.

gossipcop-8106461875,1,"Absurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek.  People are always saying unflattering things about you.  Even if you're the Pope.  The only time it can affect you, however, is when you hear about it.  Or, worse, if someone makes the unpleasant comment directly to you.  Which brings us, quite naturally, to Twitter.  Here's a place that's just too perfect for the nasty, uncontrolled insult.  You can hide behind your egg and toss Bons-Molotovs at anyone you choose.  Some people choose Kim Kardashian.  She's an easy target.  Her life seems effortless. She's painfully wealthy, with a TV show, branded products left and right and an appearance fee surely only rivaled by Hillary Clinton.  Hers is such a cushy life that she can listen to Kanye West any time she wants.  Small wonder, then, that a Twitter user called Kevin James offered a wry dig at her countenance.  Is it me, or is @KimKardashian Sooo Self-absorbed.. even when she's saying Nothing.. lol.. & I Like the Kardashians #KUWTK -- Kevin James (@kevinjames4good) January 22, 2018  If you've ever been attacked on Twitter, you have choices.  You can reply aggressively. This is rarely worth it with a troll.  You can ignore it and even block the person who directed their bile your way.  You can wait for your own fans to descend upon this poor individual and shred him from tweet to tweet.  Or, you can be splendidly disarming.  This last path was the one taken by Kardashian.  No it's not you, I totally am! https://t.co/9ZxgPyVkko -- Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) January 22, 2018  Not everyone can pull this off with a straight face.  But here, Kardashian showed she understood the emotional essence of her interlocutor.  His biggest problem was surely that he isn't Kim Kardashian.  So she brought him onto her side with something so blessedly charming that it not only made her seem entirely self-aware -- rather than merely self-absorbed -- but also must have enticed a chuckle from Kevin James himself.

The country superstar opened up about his romance with the No Doubt frontwoman in a new interview with Billboard magazine.  As previously reported, Shelton told Stefani that he was splitting from Lambert during a meeting with their Voice coworkers. The “Misery” singer, who was new to the team at the time, got emotional.  “I won’t forget that day. I looked over at Gwen — who I didn’t really know — and she had these huge tears in her eyes. I thought, ‘Wow, she feels super bad for me!’” Shelton recalled. “She didn’t tell me much, because we didn’t know each other at the time, but she said, ‘I’m going through something very similar to what you’re going through. I understand. And I hate it.’”  Stefani was dealing with her own breakup at the time with Gavin Rossdale. (As Us Weekly exclusively revealed, the Bush rocker was cheating on her with their children’s nanny, Mindy Mann.) They announced they were ending their 13-year marriage in August 2015, one month after Shelton and Lambert announced they were divorcing after four years.  The “Came Here to Forget” singer and Stefani leaned on each other for support during the difficult time. The closer they got, the more Shelton saw Stefani in a new light.  “That’s kind of how our friendship and bond started, that day. It went from that, to checking in on each other once a week through email — ‘This s–t happened to me, what happened to you?’ — to maybe three times a week, then every day, to ‘Hey, here’s my phone number if you ever want to text,’” Shelton told Billboard. “Next thing I know, I wake up and she’s all I care about, and I’m ­wondering if she feels the same about me.”  “Gwen saved my life,” he added. “Who else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician? You can’t even imagine the similarities in our divorces.”  The two teamed up professionally too. Shelton included their collaborative track, “Go Ahead and Break My Heart,” on his 12th studio album, If I’m Honest.  “When we recorded the vocals for some of these songs, I was only six months removed from when all the crap went down,” Shelton said of his split from Lambert. “When you have a broken heart — at least, when I do — you got to get it out of your system.

gossipcop-4524134287,1,"No need to rush. Jennifer Lopez is not in a hurry to walk down the aisle with Alex Rodriguez, but she does want to spend the rest of her life with someone.  “I do believe in marriage,” the Shades of Blue actress, 48, told Harper’s Bazaar in a story published on Thursday, March 15. “And I would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship. But I’m not forcing anything right now.”  As far as her relationship with the 42-year-old former Yankees player, she said: “It’s good, it’s healthy; we communicate well. We understand each other’s lives in a way that most other people couldn’t.”  She added: “We both entered the public eye in our early twenties and overachieved right from the start. And that affects every dynamic in your life, from your family to your work to your relationships. We have a similar makeup.”  The pair celebrated their anniversary in February in Minneapolis, where the singer performed a concert ahead of the Super Bowl. During the show, she debuted her single “Us” written by Poo Bear and produced by Skrillex, and dedicated it to Rodriguez, who was in the audience. “We’ve been together for one year today. I don’t want to get all mushy or anything, but baby, this song’s for you. I love you,” she told the athlete while on stage.  When talking about how she chose the song, Lopez told the magazine that the lyrics fit right into where the couple were in their relationship. She said: “They played me about 20 different songs, and when I heard this one I was like, ‘Oh, this is relevant!’ Alex and I were just getting to know each other.

But I’m not forcing anything right now.”  As far as her relationship with the 42-year-old former Yankees player, she said: “It’s good, it’s healthy; we communicate well. We understand each other’s lives in a way that most other people couldn’t.”  She added: “We both entered the public eye in our early twenties and overachieved right from the start. And that affects every dynamic in your life, from your family to your work to your relationships. We have a similar makeup.”  The pair celebrated their anniversary in February in Minneapolis, where the singer performed a concert ahead of the Super Bowl. During the show, she debuted her single “Us” written by Poo Bear and produced by Skrillex, and dedicated it to Rodriguez, who was in the audience. “We’ve been together for one year today. I don’t want to get all mushy or anything, but baby, this song’s for you. I love you,” she told the athlete while on stage.  When talking about how she chose the song, Lopez told the magazine that the lyrics fit right into where the couple were in their relationship. She said: “They played me about 20 different songs, and when I heard this one I was like, ‘Oh, this is relevant!’ Alex and I were just getting to know each other.

As an experienced journalist, I found the language used in the passage to be informative and objective. The author provides facts and quotes from various sources without taking a biased stance. The use of the word ""saddened"" to describe the National Association of Black Journalists' reaction to Hall's departure suggests a neutral tone. The author also acknowledges NBC's history of diversity and inclusion, which adds credibility to their statement.  However, some readers may interpret the phrase ""whitewashing"" as sensationalist. The term is often used to describe situations where a person or group is accused of downplaying or ignoring issues of racism or discrimination. In this context, it may be more accurate to say that NBC's decision to replace Hall with a white anchor is perceived as a setback for diversity and inclusion.  Overall, the passage provides a balanced account of the situation and avoids taking a sensationalist or inflammatory tone. The author's use of objective language and quotes from various sources helps to create a neutral and informative narrative.",rewrite_generation
gossipcop-5658990975,1,"Daniel Craig is returning as James Bond once again, even as he reportedly fights to save his marriage to Rachel Weisz at the same time. Craig has already announced his intent to return as 007 in the franchise’s 25th film, and according to the National Enquirer, he’s still struggling to salvage what’s left of his marriage.  The Enquirer’s source claimed at the beginning of 2017, “Rachel and Daniel haven’t been happy for a while, and nearly called it quits last year.” The report claims that the married couple was in two separate filming locations at the beginning of the year, but continued to stay apart even after wrapping their respective films. The Enquirer then claims that they finally reunited in July after not being seen together in ‘554 days’.  According to the sources, the minute the outlet attempted to lock down an exclusive on the couple’s rocky marriage, both Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig were seen arriving at New York’s Public Theater the next day, prompting the source to add, “The whole thing just seemed like too much of a coincidence. I don’t buy it for a minute.”  When you consider Daniel Craig’s own words, especially in the context of allegedly turning down a $150 million payday to star in two more James Bond films, he had stated, “Being on your own would be sad, sick, and weird. I don’t trust myself. I need that balance.” If these reports are to be believed, then Daniel Craig previously turned down starring in more Bond films to spend time with his family, but now – all of a sudden – he’s back to working on James Bond?  Either the report was never accurate to begin with, or he’s giving up on his marriage to Rachel Weisz. One would hope that the two have worked out whatever was troubling them in the first place, but given their own relationship and marriage histories – and how they’ve both jumped ship on long-term relationships at the drop of a hat – one wouldn’t be faulted for assuming that they are on their way to getting a divorce.  What do you guys think? Are Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz having marriage troubles, and is Daniel’s decision to take on the role of 007 again an indication that he’s giving up on his marriage?

That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.

The Weeknd and Selena Gomez are undoubtedly one of the most loving and adorable couples in Hollywood right now. Their love for each other is palpable, and it's clear that they're head over heels in love. However, it seems that the 'Starboy' singer has an even more significant reason to be happy these days - babies! Yes, you read that right. According to an exclusive source close to The Weeknd, he is reportedly 'very interested' in starting a family with the 'Fetish' songstress.
The insider revealed that The Weeknd has thought about the possibility of having children with Selena in the future, perhaps in a few years' time. And what's more, he has even expressed his desire to have a baby girl, as he believes that nothing would be better than having a miniature version of Selena Gomez running around. ""He has mentioned to her many times that two of her would always be better than one,"" the source revealed.
While The Weeknd and Selena Gomez are currently focused on their music careers and touring, the idea of starting a family together is undoubtedly on their minds. And honestly, we can't think of two people who would make better parents than these two. They have a unique bond, and their love for each other is unparalleled.
Of course, the thought of a miniature Selena Gomez running around is almost too much to handle, but we can't help but wonder if this could be a possibility in the future. Wouldn't it be amazing to see these two as parents? We're sure they would be incredible.
So, HollywoodLifers, what do you think? Do you want to see Selena Gomez and The Weeknd start a family together? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!",rewrite_generation

She has received an Academy Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards, and has been cited as Hollywood's highest-paid actress. Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin' to Get Out (1982). Her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993), followed by her first leading role in a major film, Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999). Jolie's starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her successful action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014). In the 2010s, Jolie expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), By the Sea (2015), and First They Killed My Father (2017). In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she separated from her third husband, actor Brad Pitt, in September 2016. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally. Early life and family Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[2] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[3] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[4] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[5][6] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[5] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[7] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[5][8] After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[9] Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.[10] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[11] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[12] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[13] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[9] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions. Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area's affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income. She was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.[11] Her early attempts at modeling, at her mother's insistence, proved unsuccessful.[14][15] She then transferred to Moreno High School, an alternative school, where she became a ""punk outsider,""[14] wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing, and experimenting with knife play with her live-in boyfriend.[11] She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director,[12] taking at-home courses to study embalming.[16] At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies,[9][14] though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation, ""I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk kid with tattoos.""[17] As a teenager, Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she self-harmed,[18] later commenting, ""For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me.""[19] She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder,[16] and began experimenting with drugs; by age 20, she had used ""just about every drug possible,"" particularly heroin.[20] Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicide—at age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her.[12] When she was 24, she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center's psychiatric ward.[12] Two years later, after adopting her first child, Jolie found stability in her life, later stating, ""I knew once I committed to Maddox, I would never be self-destructive again.""[21] Jolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father, which began when Voight left the family when his daughter was less than a year old.[22] She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press.[23] They reconciled when they appeared together in","You are a journalist.

She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[2] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[3] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[4] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[5][6] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[5] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[7] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[5][8] After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[9] Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.[10] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[11] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[12] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[13] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[9] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions. Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area's affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income. She was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.[11] Her early attempts at modeling, at her mother's insistence, proved unsuccessful.[14][15] She then transferred to Moreno High School, an alternative school, where she became a ""punk outsider,""[14] wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing, and experimenting with knife play with her live-in boyfriend.[11] She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director,[12] taking at-home courses to study embalming.[16] At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies,[9][14] though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation, ""I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk kid with tattoos.""[17] As a teenager, Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she self-harmed,[18] later commenting, ""For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me.""[19] She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder,[16] and began experimenting with drugs; by age 20, she had used ""just about every drug possible,"" particularly heroin.[20] Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicide—at age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her.[12] When she was 24, she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center's psychiatric ward.[12] Two years later, after adopting her first child, Jolie found stability in her life, later stating, ""I knew once I committed to Maddox, I would never be self-destructive again.""[21] Jolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father, which began when Voight left the family when his daughter was less than a year old.[22] She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press.[23] They reconciled when they appeared together in","the 1998 film Playing by Heart, but Voight cut off contact again when Jolie refused to attend his 60th birthday party.[24] Jolie has said that Voight's abandonment of the family had made her feel like ""a princess who'd been cast away,""[25] and she has been estranged from him since then. Early career and rise to prominence Jolie began her acting career as a child, playing minor roles in films such as the Pax Kristanna short film ""Moonlight and Valentino"" (1995) and the horror film ""Wolfganged"" (1996),[26] but her first major motion picture role was as a teenager in the 1993 film Cyborg 2.[27] She then appeared in the 1995 film Hackers, which was her breakthrough role,[28] and the television film ""Gia"" (1998),[29] for which she was nominated for her first Golden Globe Award.[30] Jolie's subsequent films, ""Playing by Heart"" (1998), ""Pushing Tin"" (1999), and ""The Bone Collector"" (1999),[31] did not attract as much attention as ""Gia,"" but she received critical acclaim for her performance in the latter.[32] She was then cast as the title character in the 1999 film ""Girl, Interrupted,""[33] which brought her both critical acclaim and commercial success.[34] Jolie's portrayal of Lisa Rowe, a troubled young woman who is institutionalized, earned her critical acclaim, and she won several awards for her performance, including her first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.[35] The film was a box office success, grossing over $100 million worldwide.[36] Jolie's subsequent films, including ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" (2001),[37] ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" (2005),[38] and ""Wanted"" (2008),[39] were successful at the box office and further established her as a leading actress in Hollywood. Personal life and humanitarian work Jolie is a vocal advocate for several social and humanitarian causes, including education, health, and human rights. She has been involved with several charitable organizations, such as the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, which she established with her husband Brad Pitt, and has been a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) since 2001.[40] In addition to her work with the UNHCR, Jolie has visited refugee camps around the world, including in Cambodia, Pakistan, and Somalia, and has spoken out about the need for more aid and protection for refugees.[41] In 2012, Jolie was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador by UNHCR, and has since then worked to draw attention to the plight of refugees around the world, particularly those fleeing conflict in Syria and Iraq.[42] Jolie has been recognized for her humanitarian work, including being awarded the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award at the 2013 Academy Awards, and was named one of the most influential people in the world by TIME magazine in 2005 and 2013.[43] In addition to her humanitarian work, Jolie has been recognized for her work as an actress, including winning an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, three Golden Globe Awards, and a Screen Actors Guild Award.[44] She has also been named one of the most beautiful women by various media outlets, and has been cited as one of the most powerful and influential people in the entertainment industry.[45] Divorce and custody battle Jolie filed for divorce from actor Brad Pitt in September 2016, following an incident where Pitt was accused of hitting their 15-year-old son Maddox.[46] The divorce was finalized in November 2019, with Jolie being granted physical custody of the couple's six children, while Pitt was granted visitation rights.[47] Child actors and adoption Jolie has been involved in several high-profile adoptions, including the adoption of her first child, Maddox Jolie-Pitt, who she adopted from Cambodia in 2002, and the adoption of her second child, Zahara Jolie-Pitt, who she adopted from Ethiopia in 2005.[48] Jolie has stated that she views her children as a ""blessing"" and has been praised for her commitment to their well-being and education.[49] In addition to her biological children, Jolie has been recognized for her work as a mother and has been named one of the best mothers in Hollywood by various media outlets.[50] Filmography References ^ Jump up to: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z ""Angelina Jolie"".

gossipcop-1551062653,1,"  George Clooney and his wife, Amal, attend the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. (Alberto Pizzoli/AFP via Getty Images)  Once the ultimate bachelor — and two-time People’s Sexiest Man Alive cover model — George Clooney entered entirely new territory this week.  The Oscar-winning actor and his human-rights-lawyer wife of two years, Amal, announced Tuesday that they are the proud new parents of twins, Ella and Alexander.  Clooney has donned many hats in his life — actor, director, producer and activist, but fatherhood had always seemed far away. Was it the early-onset-salt-and-pepper hair? The coterie of models who found themselves on his arm for fleeting moments over the years? The insistence by tabloids and fellow co-stars that it was time for him to settle down? Maybe. Or perhaps it was the simple fact that Clooney himself said again and again that he would not reproduce. In several interviews. Many, many times. For many, many years.  A first-time father at 56, Clooney was often asked throughout his career whether the single life was his ultimate future. But after proposing marriage to Amal in April 2014 and marrying her that September (as well as sharing wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain), it seemed as if anything was possible for the man who once said, “I don’t see myself ever having kids.”  But it was a long road to get there. “I don’t have that gene that people have to replicate,” he told People in 2006.  When Esquire asked him why he wasn’t married with kids, he replied, “I haven’t had aspirations in that way, ever.” And as for people who thought it was weird that a man in his 50s was single and childless? “What do you do? Should I go, ‘I got to get me some kids right now!’ and rush out and impregnate someone?”  Clooney seemed to express frustration when asked how he could ever relate to the fathers he occasionally portrays onscreen. His answer: “Well, I’m also not running for president, but I played that role in ‘Ides of March.’ I wasn’t an actual lawyer when I did ‘Michael Clayton,’ and I don’t fire people for a living like I did in ‘Up in the Air.’ ”  “I keep saying I’ll never get married again or have children but people just don’t want to believe me,” Clooney told Britain’s Daily Express just three months before popping the question to his now-wife.  Of course, celebrities are people, too, and it shouldn’t surprise anyone that a man might change his mind around the midcentury mark. And Clooney is certainly not alone in choosing to wait till later in life to welcome a child into the family: Comedian Steve Martin became a father at age 67 in 2012; Elton John was 63 when he had a baby via a surrogate in 2010; and Chris Noth was 53 when he welcomed his only child in 2008.  Perhaps it’s the fact that Clooney always seemed so delightfully and devilishly Clooney-ish that made his bachelordom seem like the only constant in our ever-changing popular culture. But we can rest easy knowing that despite some hesitation about having a family over the years, his sense of humor has remained steady throughout.  “Ella, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine,” the statement announcing the birth of the twins read. “George is sedated and should recover in a few days.”","You are a journalist.

It’s all just a silly myth perpetuated by the tabloids. In reality, Ed and Taylor are just two musicians who have collaborated on music, nothing more. They’ve worked together on a song and they respect each other as artists, but they’re not “besties” or anything. And as for Katy, she’s not even involved in this non-feud!

gossipcop-1289487505,1,"After years of overexposure thanks to his star-making turn in Twilight, Robert Pattinson values his privacy.  The actor appears on the September cover of GQ where he explained why he chooses to stay very quiet when it comes to his private life.  “I always think the risk reward is very much weighted in the wrong direction,” Pattinson, 31, said of opening up in interviews. “If I could stay silent, I would.”  Pattinson has been dating singer F.K.A. Twigs since 2014, and recently told Howard Stern they were “kind of” engaged. But when asked by GQ if he was getting married, the actor — who revealed he calls his girlfriend Twigs — responded with a noncommittal “eh.”  Daniel Jackson/GQ  Pattinson said that he went to therapy a few years ago – and his therapist commented that he was good at “talking without saying anything.” He said he uses that skill in all his interviews. The Good Time actor explained that he chooses to stay private so people don’t form ideas about his personality that may later change and label him as dishonest.  RELATED: Celeb Quotes of the Day: Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone & More  “I want to be misunderstood,” he told the magazine after declining to talk about anything personal. “People are always changing, and the more you put something down in print, people form opinions and they’re constantly creating who they think you are. If you do something that contradicts that, or if you do something which goes out of that box, then you can look like a liar or something like that.”  FROM PEN: Chrissy Metz on ‘This Is Us’, Crying on Set, and Her Body Positivity  The actor also revealed the great lengths he’d go to during the height of the Twilight whirlwind to a little privacy.

If he noticed he was being followed by paparazzi, he would pop into the garages, change, and leave in a different car.  He would also try to confuse photographers by having all of his friends order different rides out of restaurants when they were together and sending the cars to different places after trading outfits with one of his friends. Pattinson also recalled riding in trunks several times to hide from the photographers – and once drove around all night when one was tailing him to find out where his new house is.  “There are ways to disappear, like, fairly easily,” he said. “It just involves effort, and most people can’t be bothered to put the effort in.”  Good Time hits theaters August 11.","You are a journalist.

Here's how I would rewrite the given passage to make it more convincing:  Robert Pattinson has had enough of being hounded by the paparazzi and the constant scrutiny that comes with being a Hollywood star. After years of overexposure thanks to his breakout role in Twilight, the actor is determined to protect his privacy at all costs.  “I always think the risk reward is very much weighted in the wrong direction,” Pattinson, 31, told GQ in his September cover interview. “If I could stay silent, I would.”  Pattinson has been in a relationship with singer F.K.A. Twigs since 2014, and while he couldn’t be more private about their romance, he did reveal to Howard Stern that they are “kind of” engaged. However, when asked by GQ if he was getting married, Pattinson dodged the question with a noncommittal “eh.”  The actor’s decision to stay mum about his personal life is rooted in a therapist’s observation that he is skilled at “talking without saying anything.” Pattinson told GQ that he uses this skill in all his interviews, and it’s a deliberate choice to avoid fueling the media frenzy surrounding his every move.  “I want to be misunderstood,” Pattinson said. “People are always changing, and the more you put something down in print, people form opinions and they’re constantly creating who they think you are. If you do something that contradicts that, or if you do something which goes out of that box, then you can look like a liar or something like that.”  To maintain his privacy, Pattinson has resorted to unconventional methods to evade the paparazzi. He recounted how he would have different cars parked around Los Angeles with a full change of clothes, and if he noticed he was being followed, he would pop into the garages, change, and leave in a different car. He also revealed that he would have his friends order different rides out of restaurants and send the cars to different places after trading outfits with one of his friends, all in an effort to confuse the photographers.  In addition, Pattinson recalled riding in trunks several times to hide from the photographers – and once drove around all night when one was tailing him to find out where his new house is.  “There are ways to disappear, like, fairly easily,” he said. “It just involves effort, and most people can’t be bothered to put the effort in.”  Pattinson’s commitment to privacy is admirable, especially in today’s culture where celebrities are constantly under scrutiny. His decision to stay quiet about his personal life is a refreshing change from the usual celebrity gossip and intrusion into their private lives.  Good Time, which hits theaters August 11, is a testament to Pattinson’s dedication to his craft, and we can’t wait to see what he has in store for us next.",rewrite_generation

Lady Gaga channelled the timeless glamour of Marilyn Monroe as she strolled hand-in-hand with Bradley Cooper through the picturesque streets of Venice, Italy. The pair were in the city to promote their highly-anticipated movie, A Star Is Born, at the Venice Film Festival. As they walked, Lady Gaga's elegant gown rustled in the gentle breeze, evoking memories of Monroe's iconic red dress from the 1953 film ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes."" Cooper, with his rugged masculinity and dashing smile, complemente
d Lady Gaga's ethereal beauty, as they exuded a palpable chemistry that left onlookers in awe. The chemistry between the two actors was undeniable, and their natural ease and comfort with each other was evident in the way they interacted. As they chatted and laughed, Lady Gaga playfully tucked her hand into Cooper's, and he affectionately squeezed her hand, leaving little doubt about the depth of their relationship.
As they made their way through the festival, Lady Gaga and Cooper were bombarded with questions about their on-screen chemistry and their real-life relationship. Lady Gaga, ever the consummate professional, deftly deflected attention from her personal life, instead focusing on the film's themes of love, loss, and redemption. Cooper, too, was tight-lipped about their relationship, but his eyes betrayed a hint of pride and admiration for his co-star. As the pair concluded their press conference and bid each other farewell, it was clear that their mutual admiration and respect for each other extended far beyond the confines of the film set.",rewrite_generation

gossipcop-7658353025,1,"“A Star Is Born” is that thing we always yearn for but so rarely get to see: a transcendent Hollywood movie. It’s the fourth remake of a story that dates back to 1932, but this one has a look and vibe all its own — rapturous and swooning, but also delicate and intimate and luminous. It’s set in the present day, but in spirit it’s a sophisticated retro ’70s drama built around the uncanny flow of feeling that develops between the movie’s two stars: Bradley Cooper, who plays Jackson Maine, a hard-drinking, bad-ol’-boy redneck rock ‘n’ roller who is still hanging on as a popular attraction but has lost the lust for what he’s doing, and Lady Gaga, in her fetching and accomplished movie-star debut, as Ally, an ingenuous, fresh-faced singer-songwriter who becomes his lover and stage partner before rocketing on her own into the new pop stratosphere. She takes off as he slowly crashes — that’s the soapy tragic “Star Is Born” concept. But what the movie does is to take this fabled melodramatic romantic seesaw and turn it into something indelibly heartfelt and revealing. Cooper directed the movie himself, working from a script he co-wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, and to say that he does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment. As a filmmaker, Bradley Cooper gets right onto the high wire, staging scenes that take their time and play out with a shaggy intimacy that’s shorn of the usual “beats.” The new “Star Is Born” is a total emotional knockout, but it’s also a movie that gets you to believe, at every step, in the complicated rapture of the story it’s telling. More Reviews Venice Film review: 'Isis, Tomorrow. The Lost Souls of Mosul' Telluride Film Review: 'They'll Love Me When I'm Dead' The 1976 version, starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, had some terrific cornball love songs, but they didn’t belong anywhere near the stadium-rock stage, and neither did Streisand, which is part of why the movie came off as borderline ludicrous. It seemed stranded, with a kind of campy sincere ineptitude, between three worlds: Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand rock-princess fantasy. But from the electrifying opening moments of the new version, in which Jackson, boozy and raw, with his sunburned squint and hard-bitten shit-kicker sexiness, takes the stage of a gigantic stadium and launches into a grinding slow rocker that sounds like “Victim of Love”-era Eagles as done by the Allman Brothers, the movie is thrillingly authentic. That’s no minor accomplishment. Hollywood almost never succeeds in nailing the rock world, but “A Star Is Born,” though a love story through and through, is the most lived-in rock ‘n’ roll movie since “Almost Famous.” And that absolute looks right, sounds right, feels right verisimilitude sets the stage for everything that follows. Jackson, who looks to be in his mid-40s, has been around long enough that he now occupies a grey zone between legend and nostalgia. He can still fill an arena full of screaming fans, and his old hits have become classic-rock chestnuts, but his sound and persona have long slipped out of the zeitgeist. His whole outlaw look — the beard and rancher’s hat, the Kristofferson-meets-Skynyrd soused macho twinkle — mark him as a charismatic relic, and the grand irony is this: What that look, and sound, are all about is an era when rock ‘n’ roll strutted its “authenticity,” but now that he’s out of date, Jackson’s authenticity looks more than ever like a showbiz conceit, frozen in amber. It’s a part he’s playing, an image he’s working — and secretly struggling — to keep alive. He’s got a signature ballad that goes “Maybe it’s time to let the old ways die,” and when he wrote it (long ago), he probably didn’t know that he was talking about himself. In the first of many telling jump cuts, the film leaps from his on-stage glory to Jackson slinking into the back of his car, weary and alone, grabbing the bottle of gin he’s got stashed there. He takes a guzzle, and Cooper, acting with his body, lets you feel just how much Jackson (between sickly coughs) needs the lifeblood of that drink. It’s what he believes in more than the show he’s just finished. How do you play a drunk? We know, of course, that the answer is not to “play drunk,” but Cooper doesn’t just avoid the usual slurry shambling (though at key moments he does a little of that too, and it’s powerful). He brings off something I’ve rarely seen done this exquisitely: He plays blitzed, very functional and in his element, his smile and reflexes greased by the liquor. Jackson speaks in a deep, low, deliberate Southern-stud growl — a voice with real music in it, though one that lets you taste all the booze it’s marinated in. Needing another drink, he has his driver drop him off at the first available bar, which turns out to be a roadside dive on drag-queen karaoke night. It’s not his scene, but he doesn’t mind. He’s the same celebrity everywhere he goes, so he’s in the perfect mood of lit-up contentment when she walks on stage.

The movie is about to reveal to us why, but first it has to establish the odd-couple chemistry of its two stars. So it leaves us with a flashback of Jackson and Ally together at his house, singing his song (“I’ll Fight”) in the dim-lit basement, Jackson, with his arms folded and his face averted, bellowing out the verses in a voice that sounds, in this context, like the deepest, most authentic thing he’s ever sung, while Ally, standing close, holds the microphone and offers the soaring chorus, her voice spinning upward to an unearthly height that can only be called divine. (It’s a showstopper, and they both know it.) They’re not just singing a song. They’re making a deal with the universe, a Faustian pact in which they trade a little of their souls for the chance to make their dreams come true. When the scene ends, you feel that you’ve witnessed something cosmic and holy. The song is the title of the movie.",rewrite_generation

According to a source close to the actor, Pitt has been in touch with his emotions and true self like never before, leading him to regret leaving Aniston for his now-ex, Angelina Jolie.  The source revealed that Pitt has realized that his decision to leave Aniston for Jolie was one of the biggest mistakes of his life. Despite his feelings for Aniston, Pitt is aware that he cannot pursue a romantic relationship with her, as she is married to Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux.  However, Pitt would ""never dream of"" ruining his ex's new marriage and is willing to take a second chance at love with Aniston if the opportunity arises. The actor reportedly wants Aniston involved in his production company, Plan B, which they formed in 2001.  According to the source, Aniston wants to work with Pitt on ""prestige projects"" under his production banner, as she hopes to win an Academy Award for Best Actress.  The source concluded that Pitt still considers Aniston the love of his life.

His new album, ye, doesn’t merit any similar mercy.  On first listen, it doesn’t sound like any part of ye was recorded pre-MAGA hat picture, which blows a Kanye-head sized hole through the argument that the previous month’s behavior was a publicity stunt to promote the album. If anything, the album seems like an meek afterthought to the Twitter tirade and dive into right-wing politics. Most of it deals with the repercussions of the storm which came before it, and for the first time in his career, the artist’s personality is overwhelming the art.  The opening track ‘I Thought About Killing You’, if played in a vacuum, sounds like the work of a troubled mind. If a poem like this came from a loved one, it would surely merit discussion about a trip to the therapist. Kanye goes on to deliver cringe-worthy rhymes on issues ranging from Russell Simmons rape allegations to his petrification on realizing that his daughter might one day look like his wife. He teases a few tidbits of The Old Kanye, chopping up beats from Slick Rick and The Edwin Hawkins Singers samples on ‘No Mistakes’, to keep his fans just interested enough. It’s telling that the one standout track, ‘Ghost Town’ is the track on which Kanye lurks in the background, devoting more time on production than on spoken word, and letting John Legend and Kid Cudi take over.  If one were to ignore everything that came before ye, it would still feel like Kanye didn’t even try this time. The usual meticulousness and perfectionism has apparently been supplanted by a Kanye shrug. The music is haphazard and hollow, mirroring the guy making it. Maybe he’s become blasé and doesn’t want to spend time on music anymore. He did say he wanted to run for President in 2020 (or 2024?) anyway.","You are a journalist.

Lisa Kudrow has recently shared yet another testament to the tight-knit bond between the cast of the iconic sitcom ""Friends."" During an interview with People, the actress revealed that her co-stars went to great lengths to include her unborn child in their pre-show rituals during Seasons 4 and 5. ""The six of us would gather backstage and exchange words of encouragement, ending each huddle with the standard 'love you, love you, love you, love you,'"" Kudrow, now 55, recalled. ""But when I was pregnant, they changed the phrase to include my soon-to-be-born son, Julian Murray Stern. 'Have a great show, love you, love you – love you, little Julian!' they would say with a smile.""  Kudrow's heartwarming account highlights the deep affection and support that characterized the ""Friends"" cast's dynamic. It is not surprising, given the show's enduring popularity and the indelible mark it left on popular culture. The cast's ability to connect with one another and their fans on a personal level undoubtedly contributed to the show's success and longevity.  As Kudrow noted, the cast's inclusivity extended beyond the show's production. In 2005, Jennifer Aniston was appointed godmother of Courteney Cox's daughter, Coco Arquette, further solidifying the bonds of friendship and camaraderie between the cast members.  The ""Friends"" cast's commitment to one another and their shared art form is a testament to the power of collaboration and mutual respect in the entertainment industry.

He navigated the ups and downs of adolescence alongside his family and friends, experiencing the same range of emotions and challenges that are a hallmark of the teenage years. However, what set Eric apart was his proximity to the cultural touchstones of the 1970s, which the hit TV show ""That '70s Show"" would later parody with characteristic wit and humor.

gossipcop-1716370499,1,"Dakota Johnson; most of us know her as the actress from Fifty Shades of Grey. While we may have seen Johnson in some pretty intimate positions on-screen, there’s definitely a lot we don’t know about the Fifty Shades star. Like, for instance, the superfluity of familiar names in her family tree. Seeing that her popular movie, Fifty Shades Darker came out on the day of love—Valentine's Day—it's only fitting to dedicate a piece to the actress who brought us the sexy and quaint, Anastasia Steele. Johnson, after all, has become somewhat something of a Valentine’s Day staple, herself. Here are 15 facts about Dakota Johnson or, as some might call her, ""that girl from Fifty Shades of Grey."" We guarantee that she will no longer by ""that girl"" by the end of the list! 15 Her Family Tree Is Full Of Famous Faces You know how we said there are a few familiar names in her family tree? Well, we weren’t lying. Her parents are fellow actors, Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. Unfortunately, her parents divorced in 1994 so Dakota had to split her time between the two. ""It was the only way that I could be with them,"" she said in an interview for Cosmopolitan. ""And since they were divorced, I would spend two weeks with one and two weeks with the other, traveling with a tutor."" But wait, it gets better. Her maternal grandmother (can you guess..) is Hitchcock actress Tippi Hedren. Yes, that’s right, so clearly creative talent lies in that family. We’ve never heard of a family tree with so many famous names! Thanksgiving is probably a whirlwind. Now, Dakota Johnson is another famous name in that tree. 14 She’s An Animal Rights Activist advertising Just like her grandmother Tippi Hedren, Dakota Johnson is also an animal rights activist. Like grandmother, like granddaughter shall we say? As animal lovers ourselves, we’re pleased to hear that she’s following in her grandmother’s footsteps—both in acting and in animal rights. In 2014, Johnson saved 12 horses from being slaughtered by paying for them. What a sweet thing to do! We bet her grandmother was really proud. It’s always so great to hear about celebrities doing positive things - so naturally, we’re happy to hear of Dakota’s compassionate side. We admit we have a soft spot for animal lovers, but who doesn't? We always love hearing about people doing good deeds for animals and it’s always nice to hear celebrities using their celebrity title for the better. 13 She Grew Up Shooting Guns And Riding Horses In Colorado She may play the innocent and naive Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades movies, but growing up Johnson was anything but naive. She grew up in Colorado at her dad’s house, where she learned to build a fire, ride a horse, ride motorbikes, and even shoot a gun. And this was all before she was just 10 years old! Sounds like a badass kid to us! But when she wasn’t at her father’s house, she was at her mom’s house in L.A. which she also loved. It's hard to imagine a 10 year old these days shooting guns, riding motorbikes, or building fires without being grounded. But it sounds like she had a pretty inspiring and freeing childhood which makes us fall for the actress all the more. 12 She Never Dates advertising By the header, we mean she never has casual relationships. She only has long-term relationships. Good for her, is all we can say! You hear of so many celebrities who are constantly dating other celebrities. You can barely keep up with who they’re dating these days. It seems to be one guy or girl after another. So it’s great to hear of Dakota’s conservative views on relationships. Apparently she’s only ever been in long-term, serious relationships; she doesn’t just date. That probably explains why she’s been in a relationship with model Matthew Hitt since 2014. Yes, it’s been a kind of an on-and-off relationship but they’ve been in it for the long haul so far. So, to sum up, we like her whole dating attitude. The commitment is great and saves you a lot of time. 11 She HATED School It seems like we have something in common with Dakota Johnson: a loathing of school. Okay, so maybe not all of you hated school - many of you probably loved school or at least thrived at school. But most of us can say with the utmost certainty that we hated school with a passion. We all have our reasons why. Johnson, for instance, hated school because she felt like an ""alien."" She said she didn’t understand the process of school as a child and felt ""suffocated."" I don't know about you guys, but I can totally relate with Dakota on this. Many of us felt like we didn’t really fit in at school so it’s especially comforting to hear that a big name like Dakota Johnson also felt like a social outcast in class. Like many of us, she preferred hanging out with her friends than going to school. But hey, we admire her honesty. 10 Auditioning Gives Her Panic Attacks advertising Watching the pristine-looking A-list celebrities gliding around the Golden Globes Award ceremony is enough to wreck your mind with self-doubt over their unbelievably high levels of confidence and self esteem. If only we could possess as much poise! The truth is, many of these celebrities don’t feel that way at all; confident and self assured, that is. Dakota Johnson, for example, gets so nervous during auditions that she often has panic attacks. And we’re not just talking a bit of breathlessness here and there, we’re talking full-on panic attacks—the real deal. So before you come to your conclusions that the celebrities you see on television and in magazines are way more confident than you’ll ever be, just remember something: every single one of them suffers from self-doubt at one point or another.

It happens to all of","us, no matter what level of success we reach. And it’s good to know that Dakota Johnson is just as human as the rest of us when it comes to auditioning. 9 Her First Kiss Was With A Girl advertising Dakota Johnson’s first kiss was with a girl. This is not news to anyone who has followed her career or her life in the public eye. However, for those of you who are new to the world of Dakota Johnson, this is something worth mentioning. While her on-screen kisses with Jamie Dornan in Fifty Shades of Grey are anything but a secret, it’s nice to hear that her real-life kisses are just as interesting. Now, it’s worth noting that she doesn’t identify as a lesbian, and her sexuality is something that she keeps private. However, it’s nice to know that she’s explored all sides of her sexuality, and that her first kiss was with a girl. 8 She Was A Bridesmaid At Her Parents’ Wedding advertising Dakota Johnson was a bridesmaid at her parents’ wedding. We’re pretty sure that’s a sentence you never thought you’d read, but here we are! It’s a bit of an interesting fact to file away, isn’t it? Especially when you consider that her parents are two of Hollywood’s most famous actors. But hey, it’s nice to know that even celebrities have normal family experiences sometimes. And this fact just adds to the coziness of it all. 7 She’s Been In Love Three Times advertising Dakota Johnson has been in love three times. Now, this may not be the most surprising fact about her, given that she’s an actress who has been in the public eye for a while now. However, it’s nice to know that she’s had a few serious relationships under her belt. And who knows, maybe one of these days she’ll find that perfect someone and settle down for good. Or maybe she’ll keep on dating and never find anyone she wants to settle down with. Either way, it’s nice to know that she’s had a few love experiences under her belt. 6 She Was A Fashion Model Before Acting advertising Before Dakota Johnson became an actress, she was a fashion model. And not just any fashion model, but one who appeared in campaigns for major brands like Calvin Klein and Miu Miu.

But something happened, and suddenly it was someone else’s turn to be “it.” (It’s always someone else’s turn.)

I'm not sure why I feel this way, but I do. I guess I’m just one of those people who want to be entertained, but also want to be moved, to be challenged, to be awed, to be inspired.

Marcus Mion insisted that Neves was not among the 30 girls chosen by Bieber, and claimed that he personally invited the girls to join him at his rented villa.  While two girls were pictured leaving the club with Bieber, his aides have insisted that he believed it was a private members' club.  As Bieber continues his South America tour, his hotel in Buenos Aires has reportedly asked him to leave due to his fans causing destruction and barricading walls.  Despite the controversy surrounding his visit, Bieber has expressed his gratitude to his Argentine fans after Saturday's gig, calling Argentina ""crazy"" and telling them he loved them. 3am has contacted Bieber for a comment on the matter.",rewrite_generation

Rewritten passage:
Carlotta is a minor yet pivotal character in Gaston Leroux's 1909 novel The Phantom of the Opera, hailing from Spain. Her first appearance in the novel is during the chapter ""The New Marguerite,"" where it is revealed that she was unable to perform at the ceremony for the former managers due to unknown reasons. Later in the story, Erik, the Phantom, threatens Carlotta, warning her that if she performs at the Opera House, a great misfortune will strike. Undeterred, Carlotta takes the stage, but her performance is met with disaster as croaking noises emerge from her mouth, and the chandelier comes crashing down. Shaken by the incident, Carlotta retreats from public view for a few weeks before reappearing at the Opera House.
In the original 1925 silent film adaptation of the novel, Carlotta was portrayed by Virginia Pearson. However, due to Pearson's limited singing ability, new sound scenes were filmed in 1929, with Mary Fabian taking on the role. In the foreign cut of the film, Virginia Pearson continued to appear as Carlotta's mother. The 1943 film version of the novel saw Carlotta's character transformed into Mme. Biancarolli, who is drugged and murdered by the Phantom along with her maid.
In Andrew Lloyd Webber's production of the novel, Carlotta (now Giudicelli) is from Italy and is one of the major singing parts. She is depicted as a scheming and manipulative woman who sees Christine Daaé as a threat to her job and the Phantom's affections. Carlotta is also revealed to be a lover of tenor Ubaldo Piangi, and she turns to him for comfort when things go awry. The film adaptation of Lloyd Webber's production, released in 2004, saw Carlotta portrayed by Minnie Driver, with her singing voice dubbed by opera singer Margaret Preece.
In addition to her appearances in various film and stage adaptations, Carlotta has also made appearances in other media, such as Kim Newman's short story ""Angels of Music"" from the Tales of the Shadowmen anthology series, and the 2008 video game adaptation of the 1986 Broadway musical. In the 2019 web series adaptation of the novel, Carlotta is portrayed by actress Adèle Anderson.",rewrite_generation
gossipcop-178000221,1,"Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.

She’s hoping French gets to her before it’s too late.”  As HollywoodLife.com previously reported, it’s really hard for KoKo to ignore the rumors that TT and his baby mama, Jordy Craig, are still hooking up. In fact, we’re told Khloe’s hired some private eyes to keep tabs on her dude. “She loves Tristan wholeheartedly and he’s been nothing but a stand-up, loving man,” another source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “But she can’t help but worry sometimes. Khloe spends as much time in Cleveland as possible and has spies in every city his team plays in.”  HollywoodLifers, do you think Khloe will listen to Iggy?","Or will she keep on loving Tristan despite all these red flags? Sound off below!  I completely rewrote the passage to make it more convincing, while maintaining the same content:  International Women’s Day may have come and gone, but Iggy Azalea is determined to keep its spirit alive. The singer is using her platform to raise awareness about the potential heartbreak that Khloe Kardashian may face in her relationship with Tristan Thompson. As a fellow woman who has experienced her own share of heartbreak, Iggy feels a strong sense of responsibility to speak out and protect her fellow woman.  According to a source close to Iggy, she has reached out to her friend French Montana and shared her concerns with him. Iggy is worried that Khloe is at risk of serious heartbreak due to Tristan's past infidelity and his ongoing connection to his ex-girlfriend, Jordy Craig.  ""Iggy is not trying to be malicious or jealous,"" the source explained. ""She's just trying to protect Khloe from going through what she did with Nick Young. She knows how painful it can be to trust someone only to have them betray that trust. Iggy wants to make sure Khloe is aware of the potential risks and takes steps to protect herself.""  Khloe has been adamant about her love for Tristan, and has even hired private investigators to keep tabs on him. However, Iggy believes that it's important for Khloe to be aware of the red flags in their relationship and to take action to protect herself.  ""Khloe is a strong and capable woman, but even the strongest people can be hurt by the ones they trust the most,"" Iggy said in a statement. ""I want to make sure she knows the truth and has the support she needs to move forward with her eyes wide open.""  As a journalist, it's important to approach this story with sensitivity and respect for all parties involved. However, it's equally important to report the facts and raise awareness about the potential risks in the relationship. By sharing Iggy's concerns and providing context, we can help create a more informed and supportive community for women everywhere.",rewrite_generation

And with the way she keeps her romance private, it seems like it’s likely she’ll keep it that way.


Rewritten passage:  Despite speculation of a split, Rihanna is still very much in a committed relationship with her boyfriend of one year, Hassan Jameel. This past weekend, the couple was spotted on a romantic getaway in Mexico, where they were photographed engaging in a heated conversation. In one image, Rihanna is seen pointing her right index finger in the air with her mouth open, while Hassan looks back at her with his hand on his chest. These images have further solidified the couple's commitment to each other, despite rumors of a breakup circulating in June.  Last month, MediaTakeOut reported that Rihanna had allegedly ended her relationship with Hassan, citing sources close to the situation. However, these claims have been unequivocally denied by the couple themselves, who have remained tight-lipped about their romance.  Rihanna's previous high-profile relationship with rapper Drake ended in 2016, and since then, she has taken great efforts to keep her current relationship under wraps. This is likely due to the fact that Hassan is a Saudi billionaire, and Rihanna is keen on maintaining her privacy and avoiding unwanted attention.  Despite the couple's best efforts to keep their romance private, it appears that their love is still going strong. The two were first spotted together in July 2017, and have been seen on several other occasions since then. Rihanna has even revealed that she is happy in her relationship with Hassan, stating that she has never met someone worth sharing her personal time with.  In light of these recent developments, it seems unlikely that Rihanna will address the breakup rumors anytime soon. The couple's commitment to each other is clear, and they will undoubtedly continue to keep their romance under wraps for the foreseeable future.",rewrite_generation
gossipcop-6909849467,1,"Now, it’s official: Star Wars fans will have one final chance to say goodbye to Carrie Fisher, with Lucasfilm announcing that the actress, who died in December 2016, will appear in next year’s Star Wars: Episode IX.  In a statement, director J.J. Abrams sought to put concerns about potential CGI resurrections to rest, saying that the new movie will use “unseen footage we shot together in Episode VII” and assuring fans that “we were never going to recast, or use a CG character.” While this is, undoubtedly, comforting, it would also appear to offer particular clues about the role Fisher — or, more specifically, her character, Leia Organa — will play in the movie.  Firstly: Purely for practical purposes, Leia’s presence in the movie will be small. If nothing else, there can’t be that much extraneous, unseen footage from 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens; she was barely in that movie, so unless large swaths of scenes were shot but never even hinted at by anyone involved in the production, there’s limited material to draw from in the first place, and surely not everything available will be used.  Considering the context of the footage, it also limits the potential use for Episode IX. Leia appeared in few scenes and locations in The Force Awakens. Leia was on Takodana, rescuing Han, Chewbacca, Rey and Finn, and then at the Resistance base on D’Qar, where she takes part in planning, and later monitoring, the attack on Starkiller Base. Aside from brief interludes with Han and, later, Rey, she’s very much in “harried leader” mode throughout the movie. Does this mean that this is the Leia we’ll see in Episode IX, even after losing her ex-husband, and then her brother, in the previous two movies?  (It’s possible that the Fisher footage will end up being just a minor flashback, used to punctuate a contemporary moment; memories during her funeral, as some on social media have already suggested. If so, then the above problem is side-stepped, to a degree.)  Abrams’ comments leave space for some level of postproduction trickery to be applied to the Fisher footage. Presumably, Fisher will be intercut with new footage of actors shot specifically for Episode IX. Will digital trickery be used to make sure that Fisher shares a location with the other cast members? If so, will that be all that’s altered? What about costuming choices? For that matter, what about the potential for posthumous dubbing or soundalikes used for dialogue where Leia is off-camera or not in close-up? Abrams said that the movie would never use a CG character, but what about a performance augmented or altered by CG?  Of course, if any such edits or alterations are made, they’ll have to be done with subtlety and sensitivity. This is key to the entire enterprise of including footage of Fisher posthumously. For as much as fans want to be able to say goodbye to the actress, and also to Leia, they want to do so in a manner that feels appropriate and respectful to both. While Abrams and Lucasfilm — and Fisher’s family, especially daughter Billie Lourd, named in Abrams’ statement — want to provide both closure and tribute to Leia and Fisher alike with this move, they’re courting backlash if this isn’t done perfectly.  That the footage will come from The Force Awakens feels particularly fitting, then; that, after all, was a project that already came with expectations and looming accusations from fandom expecting the worst. It’s also perhaps a reminder that those involved with this move love the mythology — and loved Fisher as a person — as much as anyone else, if not more so, and will be approaching it with the utmost care.  Everyone will, inevitably, remain worried until the final product appears onscreen, but perhaps we can rest just slightly in the meantime.","You are a journalist.

As a journalist, it’s important to note that Mr. Washington’s comments reflect a broader sentiment among many in Hollywood and beyond.  In recent years, there has been growing recognition among celebrities and ordinary citizens alike that the status quo is unsustainable, and that we must work together to address the many social and political issues that face us.  Whether it’s the Black Lives Matter movement, the #MeToo movement, or the push for greater diversity and inclusion in all areas of society, there is a growing sense that we must take action to create a more just and equitable world.  Of course, the challenge is not just about raising awareness or mobilizing people to take action. It’s also about building the systems and structures that will allow us to make meaningful progress on these issues.  But as Mr. Washington’s comments suggest, we can’t give up hope.

gossipcop-8854037683,1,"Titanic II is set to launch in less than two years — not in movie theaters, but on the open sea.  A replica of the world’s most famous “unsinkable” ship — which struck an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912, killing 1,503 people — is under construction, with a maiden voyage planned for 2018.  Australian tycoon and politician Clive Palmer — not J. Bruce Ismay — is at the helm of the ambitious project to faithfully recreate the luxury ship, which will be about 13 feet wider to meet current regulations.  More importantly, it will carry enough lifeboats for every passenger and its hull will be welded, not riveted, just in case it comes across a rogue iceberg, the Belfast Telegraph reports.  “The new Titanic will of course have modern evacuation procedures, satellite controls, digital navigation and radar systems and all those things you’d expect on a 21st-century ship,” James McDonald, global marketing director of Palmer’s company, Blue Star Line, told the paper.  The new nine-deck ship will be 885 feet long, about two more than her doomed predecessor, 174 feet high and have a maximum speed of 24 knots. She will accommodate 2,400 passengers — 177 more than the RMS Titanic.  It also will feature the same categories of passengers — from the first-class movers and shakers to the hoi polloi in third class, where poor Leonardo DiCaprio was berthed in the classic movie.  Unlike the Belfast-built original, the Titanic II is under construction by the CSC Jinling Shipyard in Jiangsu, China.  Its maiden voyage will not be from Southampton to New York, but rather from Jiangsu, China, to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, the paper reported.  Some of the dead passengers’ relatives have criticized the plans for a new Titanic, but Blue Star has reportedly been flooded with requests for tickets — with some offering up to about $900,000 for a spot on the first trip.","You are a journalist.

According to Blue Star Line, the company behind the project, the new Titanic II promises to be a once-in-a-lifetime experience for those who want to relive the tragedy or simply experience the magic of the ship that was.  As the world prepares to bid farewell to the original Titanic, which will sink in a controlled explosion in 2019, the new Titanic II offers a chance to rediscover the history and romance of the ""ship of dreams.""",rewrite_generation

Where do they come from and who are these “sources”? Hummmm.”  In fairness, Khloe may not have been referring to this story in particular. But she also may very well have been. You get me?  Khloe still hasn’t directly commented on the Tristan situation, but she certainly has been posting some super-cryptic quotes on her social media, which give us absolutely no insight into what the hell is going on. So that’s fun…  First she tweeted this last week: “You will never ever regret being kind to someone.”  Then when someone commented, “Unless they're ungrateful for it”, she replied, “Never give to get. Always try to give without expectations. Whether that be something tangible or emotional.”  Then yesterday she went on Instagram Stories to write: “Your mind will always believe everything you tell it. Feed it faith. Feed it truth. Feed it with love.”  And then: “Nobody cares about your story until you win. So win.”  Soooooooo, you marrying Tristan or not, Khloe?","You are a journalist.

Okay, here is how I would rewrite the passage to make it more convincing:  Khloe Kardashian has made it abundantly clear that she is not one to be trifled with. In a bold move, she has opted to prioritize her own happiness and well-being, rather than indulge in the never-ending drama that often plagues her family.  According to a recent report in People magazine, Khloe is ""officially not here to take anyone's shit,"" and has made it clear that she will not be swayed by the constant scrutiny and criticism that comes with being a member of the Kardashian-Jenner clan.  The report, which cites a ""source"" close to the reality star, reveals that Khloe is happy with her decision to stay in Cleveland with her daughter, True, and is even considering marriage to her partner, Tristan Thompson.  While Khloe has yet to directly address the recent rumors and speculation surrounding her relationship with Tristan, it is clear that she is determined to forge her own path and live her life on her own terms.  Through her social media posts, Khloe has been sharing cryptic quotes and messages that seem to suggest a newfound sense of self-awareness and inner peace.  In a series of tweets last week, she wrote, ""You will never ever regret being kind to someone,"" followed by, ""Never give to get. Always try to give without expectations. Whether that be something tangible or emotional.""  These words of wisdom seem to indicate that Khloe is focused on cultivating a positive and compassionate mindset, and is determined to surround herself with people who share her values and goals.  As she continues to navigate the ups and downs of her personal life, it is clear that Khloe Kardashian is no longer willing to compromise her own happiness for the sake of appearances.  In a world where reality TV stars are often reduced to mere caricatures of themselves, Khloe's commitment to living an authentic and meaningful life is a breath of fresh air.  As we eagerly await her next move, it is clear that Khloe Kardashian is a force to be reckoned with, and will not be silenced by the constant scrutiny and criticism that comes with being a member of the Kardashian-Jenner clan.",rewrite_generation
gossipcop-2509430407,1,"Are wedding bells in the future for Mariah Carey? The iconic singer reportedly popped the question to her bae, Bryan Tanaka, and the two are busy planning their big day!  Did Mariah Carey, 47, have a vision of love when looking at boyfriend Bryan Tanaka, 34, one that left her feeling all sorts of emotions? After deciding that she just can’t let go of this hunk, Mariah reportedly decided to make it happen – an engagement, that is! “Word is Mariah took matters into her own hands,” a source tells OK! magazine, “It was an unusual proposal but it did the trick. She wrote a song about how she wanted Bryan to be her husband and she performed it for him while wearing a sexy, glitzy gown. Then she explained that she’s ready for them to make their relationship official.”  Bryan gave a “hearty yes,” as the insider says, “He couldn’t believe his luck!” It appears Bryan also thinks he and Mariah belong together, and he always wants to be her baby. These two aren’t waiting around for one sweet day to tie the knot. While love takes time, Mariah and Bryan are already busy making wedding plans. “Mariah would love to get married in May at the Grand Wailea Resort in Maui,” the insider told OK!, “where she and Bryan first went public with their romance.” Mariah and Bryan struck up a relationship in late 2016, with Mariah low-key confirming the romance in February 2017 by calling Bryan her “boyfriend.”  Mariah’s “also toying with the idea of a winter wonderland wedding,” the source says. “After all, she is the queen of Christmas!” Could Mariah have the fantasy holiday wedding she’s always wanted, saying “Thank God I found you” to her honey, her all? Whenever Mariah decides to get married, don’t forget about us when it comes to the wedding invitations!  This alleged engagement would be the third time Mariah walked down the aisle, as she was previously married to Tommy Mottola, 68, and Nick Cannon, 37. After dealing with a pair of heartbreakers, MiMi isn’t fooling around, especially when it comes to her $520 million fortune. She’s working on an ironclad prenup, according to OK! magazine. “She’s had tow failed marriages already,” the source says. “She’s not going to take any risks here.” Speaking of Nick, expect to see him during Mariah’s big day.  Nick and Mariah’s twins – son Morocco and daughter Monroe, 6 – will be featured in his wedding, and sources say Mariah’s thinking of asking Nick to walk her down the aisle. “[He] will always be a big part of her life,” the source added.

gossipcop-8581615474,1,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired.

T","ellingly, neither Holmes nor Foxx has publicly acknowledged their relationship since.  The Radar report, however, suggests that the two may have been planning a wedding as early as last year, with a source claiming that Holmes had even picked out a $300,000 wedding dress.  If true, the news would be a significant development in the lives of the two high-profile celebrities.  It would mark the first time Holmes has been in a serious relationship since her divorce from Cruise in 2012, and the first time Foxx has been in a long-term relationship since his split from Grannis in 2010.  Holmes and Foxx were first spotted together in 2013, but they kept their relationship largely under wraps, with the exception of a few paparazzi shots of them together.  It’s worth noting that neither Holmes nor Foxx has publicly confirmed their relationship, and both have denied any reports of an engagement or wedding plans.  But the Radar report suggests that the two may have been closer than they let on.  In addition to the alleged wedding plans, the report also claims that Foxx was spotted with Grannis at a party in November, which has led to speculation that he may not be over his ex-girlfriend.  The report also notes that Holmes is said to be ""torn"" about her relationship with Foxx, with a source claiming that she is ""not sure if she wants to be with him long-term.""  It's worth noting that neither Holmes nor Foxx has publicly addressed these reports, and it's possible that the entire story is simply a rumor.  However, if the report is true, it would be a significant development in the lives of these two high-profile celebrities.",rewrite_generation
