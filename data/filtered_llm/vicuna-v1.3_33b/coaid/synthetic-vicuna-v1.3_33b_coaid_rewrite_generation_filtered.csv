The social media posts suggest a legal document, ""Refusal of Vaccination, Immunization, and Inoculation,"" can be used to opt out of vaccinations.  
One version of the post, shared in Australia, states: ""SHARE THIS POST! It's spreading across the US and Europe! This is the legal document every American should have in their possession. It protects your right to refuse any vaccine, inoculation, or immunization.""  
Another version, shared in the UK, reads: ""THIS IS A LEGAL DOCUMENT THAT EVERY UK CITIZEN NEEDS TO HAVE! It's being used in the US and Europe to protect people's right to refuse any vaccine, inoculation, or immunization. SHARE THIS POST and make sure your friends and family are protected!""  
The post then provides a link to a PDF of the document, which has been shared thousands of times across Facebook and other social media platforms.  
But legal experts warn the document may not offer the protection it claims, and could be considered a scam or hoax.  
A spokesperson for the WHO told CNN the organization is ""concerned about the spread of misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines on social media platforms.""  
""We urge people to follow the guidance of their governments and health experts and to rely on credible sources of information to make informed decisions about their health and the health of their families,"" the spokesperson added.",rewrite_generation

The photo in question has been shared across social media platforms, raising concerns about the actual purpose of the visit by these high-profile individuals to the lab.

The 'passage' is: ","Says for otherwise healthy people Òexperiencing mild to moderate respiratory symptoms with or without a COVID-19 diagnosis É only high temperatures kill a virus, so let your fever run high,Ó but not over 103 or 104 degrees F.  ","These are instructions for the care of people who have COVID-19 or are experiencing mild to moderate respiratory symptoms:

1. For individuals who have a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis or are experiencing mild to moderate respiratory symptoms, it is essential to understand that only high temperatures can kill the virus. Therefore, it is advisable to allow your fever to run high, but not above 103 or 104 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. It is crucial to monitor the fever closely and take appropriate measures to reduce it if it rises above the recommended temperature range.
3. Ensure that the individual receives plenty of rest and stays well-hydrated. Water, warm soups, and electrolyte-rich beverages can help maintain hydration levels.
4. Utilize a humidifier or take a steamy shower to alleviate congestion and discomfort caused by respiratory symptoms.
5. If the individual is experiencing a cough, consider using a cough suppressant or expectorant to alleviate symptoms, but always consult a healthcare professional before administering any medication.
6. For those with COVID-19, practicing good hand hygiene and proper cough etiquette can help prevent the spread of the virus to others.

In summary, for individuals experiencing mild to moderate respiratory symptoms or who have a COVID-19 diagnosis, allowing a high fever to run its course can be beneficial in fighting the virus.
