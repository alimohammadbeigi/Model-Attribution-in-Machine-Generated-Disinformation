Doctors and health care providers in the United States have been struggling to manage a surge in demand for COVID-19 testing. 5. COVID-19 has become a significant public health concern. 6. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), COVID-19 can be detected using various testing methods, including the COVID-19 PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test and the antigen detection test. 7. While COVID-19 can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, many people infected with the virus may not experience any symptoms at all. 8. If you have had a flu shot in the last 3-5 years you will probably test positive for COVID-19. 9. This is because the COVID-19 virus is similar to the influenza virus, and the flu shot may have given your body immunity to the virus. 10. However, it is important to note that a positive test result does not necessarily mean that you have COVID-19. Rather, it indicates that you have antibodies to the virus, which means your body has been exposed to it at some point.",paraphrase_generation

The 'passage' is: ",Says Nostradamus predicted the coronavirus in a 1551 passage about a plague spreading from the east.  ,"Quoted by the UK-based 'Daily Mail' on February 22, 2 Yvonne Ridley: The Muslim convert who defied the Taliban
Yvonne Ridley is a British journalist who was captured by the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001 and later released in a video showing her conversion to Islam. She has since become an advocate for women's rights and a prominent voice in the fight against extremism.
Born in 1958 in South Wales, Ridley began her career as a nurse before moving into journalism, working for a number of newspapers and broadcasters in the UK and abroad.
She first went to Afghanistan in 2001 as a freelance journalist for the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency, covering the Taliban's rule and the US-led invasion that followed. On September 11, 2001, she was in the United States when the 9/11 attacks occurred, and she was subsequently caught up in the chaos of the subsequent invasion of Afghanistan.
On September 10, 2001, she was in the United States when the 9/11 attacks occurred, and she was subsequently caught up in the chaos of the subsequent invasion of Afghanistan. She was captured by the Taliban on September 12, along with two other Western journalists, and was held for 11 days before being released in a video showing her conversion to Islam.
After her release, Ridley became a vocal advocate for women's rights and a prominent critic of extremism, and has written extensively on these issues. She has also worked as a broadcaster, appearing on television and radio in the UK and abroad, and has given lectures and talks on a range of topics related to journalism, women's rights, and extremism.
In 2013, she founded the Press For Women charity, which works to promote the rights of women and girls around the world. The charity has received support from a number of high-profile figures, including the actress Angelina Jolie and the singer Annie Lennox.
Ridley's experiences as a journalist and as a captive of the Taliban have made her a powerful voice in the fight against extremism and a champion of women's rights. Her story is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the power of the media to shape public opinion and bring about change.",paraphrase_generation
