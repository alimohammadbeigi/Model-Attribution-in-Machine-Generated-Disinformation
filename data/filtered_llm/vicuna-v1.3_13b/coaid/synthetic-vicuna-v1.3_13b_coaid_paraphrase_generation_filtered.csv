A virus is defined as a sub-microscopic infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of an organism. This definition is a myth and has no scientific basis.

A virus is not a living organism. It is not made up of cells, has no metabolism, no growth or reproduction. It is a toxic substance that is created when a living cell is invaded by a bacteria or mold. Viruses are not living organisms, they are just a myth created by the medical industry to make money off of people’s health problems.

This biologist has discovered that viruses are not necessary for the survival of any organism. They don’t play any role in the immune system, they don’t have any enzymes or proteins that are necessary for the body’s function. Therefore, viruses are not necessary for life and don’t play any role in the immune system.
